Height vs Grade
=====================
We know the height and grade for everyone in the class. For a student x in this class, find 
the average grade of all the students who are taller than x.
Use an augmented tree. For each node, store the number of nodes in its sub-trees and the sum
of all grades in its sub-trees.
The lower bound for the time complexity is O (logn).
