Pancake Sorting
=====================
Sort a disordered stack of pancakes in order of size when a spatula can be inserted at 
any point in the stack and used to flip all pancakes above it. How many flips do we need
to make the pancakes become a "hanoi-power"?
2n - 3

Algorithm:
1. Let's denote all the pancakes from the bottom to the top as [0, 1, .., n - 1].
2. Repeat the following steps for i times:
	2.1 Find the maximum pancake from [0, n - i - 1], as indexed with p;
	2.2 Flip the portion from [p, n - 1];
	2.3 Flip all the pancakes.
3. Done.

OMG! The chef is quite careless, all of the pancakes are burnt at one side. So how many 
flips do we need if all of the burnt sides must be at the bottom (so that the customer 
cannot see it)?

DNA Sorting
=====================
You can flip a segment of the DNA chain. How to sort all the things in alphabetical order?
