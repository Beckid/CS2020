Voting
=====================
We have n voters and k candidates.
Input: An array of integers, each of which represents the candidate he votes for.
Constraint: Time, space, read-only

Approaches:
1. Normal sort: first sort, then Herbert binary search;
Time complexity: O(nlogn)
Space complexity: O(k)

2. Bucket sort: B[A[i]]++;
Time complexity: O(n)
Space complexity: O(k)

3. Quick select: Try to find i * n / k each time
Time complexity: O(n*k)
Space complexity: O(1)

4. Divide and conquer: 
Claim: Either x or y is the winner overall.
Time complexity: O(nlogn)
Space complexity: O(1)

5. Randomized: 

6. Boyer-Moore algorithm:
Time complexity: O(n)
Space complexity: O(1)
