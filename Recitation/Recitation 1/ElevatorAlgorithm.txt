Elevator Problem

1. Most of the elevators in the world follow a similar set of algorithms. So what is it?
a) Current Task - direction and destination level
b) Priority of tasks
The elevator should keep a listener, which listens to all buttons pressed on/down all the time.
When a new press-button operation is done, it will be inserted into the task queue to a specific
position according to its priority.

2. What do you mean by "better"? How to measure better or not?
Average, Standard Deviation, Maximum?
Waiting Time, Distance traveled, Electric cost, Maintenance cost, Speed constraints, Perceived Time

3. Improvements? Trade-offs?

4. How to simulate the elevator?
