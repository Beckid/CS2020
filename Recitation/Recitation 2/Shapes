1. What should be a suitable hierarchy for shapes?

Shape -> Attribute -> xPos, yPos, center, 
		 Method -> area, move, zoom, rotate, flip
		 Child -> etc.
		 
Rectangle - Square Problem:
In Rectangle class, there is a public method called void setSide(int a, int b)
In Square class, what if we call setSide(3, 4)?
An error will occur since all sides should the same length in a square.

2. Cube Override Problem
public class Queue {
	public void add(int x) {
	}
}

This is about the override problem between super class and subclass.
