The Tragedie of Hamlet

Actus Primus. Scoena Prima.

Enter Barnardo and Francisco two Centinels.

  Barnardo. Who's there?
  Fran. Nay answer me: Stand & vnfold
your selfe

   Bar. Long liue the King

   Fran. Barnardo?
  Bar. He

   Fran. You come most carefully vpon your houre

   Bar. 'Tis now strook twelue, get thee to bed Francisco

   Fran. For this releefe much thankes: 'Tis bitter cold,
And I am sicke at heart

   Barn. Haue you had quiet Guard?
  Fran. Not a Mouse stirring

   Barn. Well, goodnight. If you do meet Horatio and
Marcellus, the Riuals of my Watch, bid them make hast.
Enter Horatio and Marcellus.

  Fran. I thinke I heare them. Stand: who's there?
  Hor. Friends to this ground

   Mar. And Leige-men to the Dane

   Fran. Giue you good night

   Mar. O farwel honest Soldier, who hath relieu'd you?
  Fra. Barnardo ha's my place: giue you goodnight.

Exit Fran.

  Mar. Holla Barnardo

   Bar. Say, what is Horatio there?
  Hor. A peece of him

   Bar. Welcome Horatio, welcome good Marcellus

   Mar. What, ha's this thing appear'd againe to night

   Bar. I haue seene nothing

   Mar. Horatio saies, 'tis but our Fantasie,
And will not let beleefe take hold of him
Touching this dreaded sight, twice seene of vs,
Therefore I haue intreated him along
With vs, to watch the minutes of this Night,
That if againe this Apparition come,
He may approue our eyes, and speake to it

   Hor. Tush, tush, 'twill not appeare

   Bar. Sit downe a-while,
And let vs once againe assaile your eares,
That are so fortified against our Story,
What we two Nights haue seene

   Hor. Well, sit we downe,
And let vs heare Barnardo speake of this

   Barn. Last night of all,
When yond same Starre that's Westward from the Pole
Had made his course t' illume that part of Heauen
Where now it burnes, Marcellus and my selfe,
The Bell then beating one

   Mar. Peace, breake thee of:
Enter the Ghost.

Looke where it comes againe

   Barn. In the same figure, like the King that's dead

   Mar. Thou art a Scholler; speake to it Horatio

   Barn. Lookes it not like the King? Marke it Horatio

   Hora. Most like: It harrowes me with fear & wonder
  Barn. It would be spoke too

   Mar. Question it Horatio

   Hor. What art thou that vsurp'st this time of night,
Together with that Faire and Warlike forme
In which the Maiesty of buried Denmarke
Did sometimes march: By Heauen I charge thee speake

   Mar. It is offended

   Barn. See, it stalkes away

   Hor. Stay: speake; speake: I Charge thee, speake.

Exit the Ghost.

  Mar. 'Tis gone, and will not answer

   Barn. How now Horatio? You tremble & look pale:
Is not this something more then Fantasie?
What thinke you on't?
  Hor. Before my God, I might not this beleeue
Without the sensible and true auouch
Of mine owne eyes

   Mar. Is it not like the King?
  Hor. As thou art to thy selfe,
Such was the very Armour he had on,
When th' Ambitious Norwey combatted:
So frown'd he once, when in an angry parle
He smot the sledded Pollax on the Ice.
'Tis strange

   Mar. Thus twice before, and iust at this dead houre,
With Martiall stalke, hath he gone by our Watch

   Hor. In what particular thought to work, I know not:
But in the grosse and scope of my Opinion,
This boades some strange erruption to our State

   Mar. Good now sit downe, & tell me he that knowes
Why this same strict and most obseruant Watch,
So nightly toyles the subiect of the Land,
And why such dayly Cast of Brazon Cannon
And Forraigne Mart for Implements of warre:
Why such impresse of Ship-wrights, whose sore Taske
Do's not diuide the Sunday from the weeke,
What might be toward, that this sweaty hast
Doth make the Night ioynt-Labourer with the day:
Who is't that can informe me?
  Hor. That can I,
At least the whisper goes so: Our last King,
Whose Image euen but now appear'd to vs,
Was (as you know) by Fortinbras of Norway,
(Thereto prick'd on by a most emulate Pride)
Dar'd to the Combate. In which, our Valiant Hamlet,
(For so this side of our knowne world esteem'd him)
Did slay this Fortinbras: who by a Seal'd Compact,
Well ratified by Law, and Heraldrie,
Did forfeite (with his life) all those his Lands
Which he stood seiz'd on, to the Conqueror:
Against the which, a Moity competent
Was gaged by our King: which had return'd
To the Inheritance of Fortinbras,
Had he bin Vanquisher, as by the same Cou'nant
And carriage of the Article designe,
His fell to Hamlet. Now sir, young Fortinbras,
Of vnimproued Mettle, hot and full,
Hath in the skirts of Norway, heere and there,
Shark'd vp a List of Landlesse Resolutes,
For Foode and Diet, to some Enterprize
That hath a stomacke in't: which is no other
(And it doth well appeare vnto our State)
But to recouer of vs by strong hand
And termes Compulsatiue, those foresaid Lands
So by his Father lost: and this (I take it)
Is the maine Motiue of our Preparations,
The Sourse of this our Watch, and the cheefe head
Of this post-hast, and Romage in the Land.
Enter Ghost againe.

But soft, behold: Loe, where it comes againe:
Ile crosse it, though it blast me. Stay Illusion:
If thou hast any sound, or vse of Voyce,
Speake to me. If there be any good thing to be done,
That may to thee do ease, and grace to me; speak to me.
If thou art priuy to thy Countries Fate
(Which happily foreknowing may auoyd) Oh speake.
Or, if thou hast vp-hoorded in thy life
Extorted Treasure in the wombe of Earth,
(For which, they say, you Spirits oft walke in death)
Speake of it. Stay, and speake. Stop it Marcellus

   Mar. Shall I strike at it with my Partizan?
  Hor. Do, if it will not stand

   Barn. 'Tis heere

   Hor. 'Tis heere

   Mar. 'Tis gone.

Exit Ghost.

We do it wrong, being so Maiesticall
To offer it the shew of Violence,
For it is as the Ayre, invulnerable,
And our vaine blowes, malicious Mockery

   Barn. It was about to speake, when the Cocke crew

   Hor. And then it started, like a guilty thing
Vpon a fearfull Summons. I haue heard,
The Cocke that is the Trumpet to the day,
Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding Throate
Awake the God of Day: and at his warning,
Whether in Sea, or Fire, in Earth, or Ayre,
Th' extrauagant, and erring Spirit, hyes
To his Confine. And of the truth heerein,
This present Obiect made probation

   Mar. It faded on the crowing of the Cocke.
Some sayes, that euer 'gainst that Season comes
Wherein our Sauiours Birch is celebrated,
The Bird of Dawning singeth all night long:
And then (they say) no Spirit can walke abroad,
The nights are wholsome, then no Planets strike,
No Faiery talkes, nor Witch hath power to Charme:
So hallow'd, and so gracious is the time

   Hor. So haue I heard, and do in part beleeue it.
But looke, the Morne in Russet mantle clad,
Walkes o're the dew of yon high Easterne Hill,
Breake we our Watch vp, and by my aduice
Let vs impart what we haue seene to night
Vnto yong Hamlet. For vpon my life,
This Spirit dumbe to vs, will speake to him:
Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it,
As needfull in our Loues, fitting our Duty?
  Mar. Let do't I pray, and I this morning know
Where we shall finde him most conueniently.

Exeunt.

Scena Secunda.

Enter Claudius King of Denmarke, Gertrude the Queene, Hamlet,
Polonius,
Laertes, and his Sister Ophelia, Lords Attendant.

  King. Though yet of Hamlet our deere Brothers death
The memory be greene: and that it vs befitted
To beare our hearts in greefe, and our whole Kingdome
To be contracted in one brow of woe:
Yet so farre hath Discretion fought with Nature,
That we with wisest sorrow thinke on him,
Together with remembrance of our selues.
Therefore our sometimes Sister, now our Queene,
Th' imperiall Ioyntresse of this warlike State,
Haue we, as 'twere, with a defeated ioy,
With one Auspicious, and one Dropping eye,
With mirth in Funerall, and with Dirge in Marriage,
In equall Scale weighing Delight and Dole
Taken to Wife; nor haue we heerein barr'd
Your better Wisedomes, which haue freely gone
With this affaire along, for all our Thankes.
Now followes, that you know young Fortinbras,
Holding a weake supposall of our worth;
Or thinking by our late deere Brothers death,
Our State to be disioynt, and out of Frame,
Colleagued with the dreame of his Aduantage;
He hath not fayl'd to pester vs with Message,
Importing the surrender of those Lands
Lost by his Father: with all Bonds of Law
To our most valiant Brother. So much for him.
Enter Voltemand and Cornelius.

Now for our selfe, and for this time of meeting
Thus much the businesse is. We haue heere writ
To Norway, Vncle of young Fortinbras,
Who Impotent and Bedrid, scarsely heares
Of this his Nephewes purpose, to suppresse
His further gate heerein. In that the Leuies,
The Lists, and full proportions are all made
Out of his subiect: and we heere dispatch
You good Cornelius, and you Voltemand,
For bearing of this greeting to old Norway,
Giuing to you no further personall power
To businesse with the King, more then the scope
Of these dilated Articles allow:
Farewell, and let your hast commend your duty

   Volt. In that, and all things, will we shew our duty

   King. We doubt it nothing, heartily farewell.

Exit Voltemand and Cornelius.

And now Laertes, what's the newes with you?
You told vs of some suite. What is't Laertes?
You cannot speake of Reason to the Dane,
And loose your voyce. What would'st thou beg Laertes,
That shall not be my Offer, not thy Asking?
The Head is not more Natiue to the Heart,
The Hand more instrumentall to the Mouth,
Then is the Throne of Denmarke to thy Father.
What would'st thou haue Laertes?
  Laer. Dread my Lord,
Your leaue and fauour to returne to France,
From whence, though willingly I came to Denmarke
To shew my duty in your Coronation,
Yet now I must confesse, that duty done,
My thoughts and wishes bend againe towards France,
And bow them to your gracious leaue and pardon

   King. Haue you your Fathers leaue?
What sayes Pollonius?
  Pol. He hath my Lord:
I do beseech you giue him leaue to go

   King. Take thy faire houre Laertes, time be thine,
And thy best graces spend it at thy will:
But now my Cosin Hamlet, and my Sonne?
  Ham. A little more then kin, and lesse then kinde

   King. How is it that the Clouds still hang on you?
  Ham. Not so my Lord, I am too much i'th' Sun

   Queen. Good Hamlet cast thy nightly colour off,
And let thine eye looke like a Friend on Denmarke.
Do not for euer with thy veyled lids
Seeke for thy Noble Father in the dust;
Thou know'st 'tis common, all that liues must dye,
Passing through Nature, to Eternity

   Ham. I Madam, it is common

   Queen. If it be;
Why seemes it so particular with thee

   Ham. Seemes Madam? Nay, it is: I know not Seemes:
'Tis not alone my Inky Cloake (good Mother)
Nor Customary suites of solemne Blacke,
Nor windy suspiration of forc'd breath,
No, nor the fruitfull Riuer in the Eye,
Nor the deiected hauiour of the Visage,
Together with all Formes, Moods, shewes of Griefe,
That can denote me truly. These indeed Seeme,
For they are actions that a man might play:
But I haue that Within, which passeth show;
These, but the Trappings, and the Suites of woe

   King. 'Tis sweet and commendable
In your Nature Hamlet,
To giue these mourning duties to your Father:
But you must know, your Father lost a Father,
That Father lost, lost his, and the Suruiuer bound
In filiall Obligation, for some terme
To do obsequious Sorrow. But to perseuer
In obstinate Condolement, is a course
Of impious stubbornnesse. 'Tis vnmanly greefe,
It shewes a will most incorrect to Heauen,
A Heart vnfortified, a Minde impatient,
An Vnderstanding simple, and vnschool'd:
For, what we know must be, and is as common
As any the most vulgar thing to sence,
Why should we in our peeuish Opposition
Take it to heart? Fye, 'tis a fault to Heauen,
A fault against the Dead, a fault to Nature,
To Reason most absurd, whose common Theame
Is death of Fathers, and who still hath cried,
From the first Coarse, till he that dyed to day,
This must be so. We pray you throw to earth
This vnpreuayling woe, and thinke of vs
As of a Father; For let the world take note,
You are the most immediate to our Throne,
And with no lesse Nobility of Loue,
Then that which deerest Father beares his Sonne,
Do I impart towards you. For your intent
In going backe to Schoole in Wittenberg,
It is most retrograde to our desire:
And we beseech you, bend you to remaine
Heere in the cheere and comfort of our eye,
Our cheefest Courtier Cosin, and our Sonne

   Qu. Let not thy Mother lose her Prayers Hamlet:
I prythee stay with vs, go not to Wittenberg

   Ham. I shall in all my best
Obey you Madam

   King. Why 'tis a louing, and a faire Reply,
Be as our selfe in Denmarke. Madam come,
This gentle and vnforc'd accord of Hamlet
Sits smiling to my heart; in grace whereof,
No iocond health that Denmarke drinkes to day,
But the great Cannon to the Clowds shall tell,
And the Kings Rouce, the Heauens shall bruite againe,
Respeaking earthly Thunder. Come away.

Exeunt.

Manet Hamlet.

  Ham. Oh that this too too solid Flesh, would melt,
Thaw, and resolue it selfe into a Dew:
Or that the Euerlasting had not fixt
His Cannon 'gainst Selfe-slaughter. O God, O God!
How weary, stale, flat, and vnprofitable
Seemes to me all the vses of this world?
Fie on't? Oh fie, fie, 'tis an vnweeded Garden
That growes to Seed: Things rank, and grosse in Nature
Possesse it meerely. That it should come to this:
But two months dead: Nay, not so much; not two,
So excellent a King, that was to this
Hiperion to a Satyre: so louing to my Mother,
That he might not beteene the windes of heauen
Visit her face too roughly. Heauen and Earth
Must I remember: why she would hang on him,
As if encrease of Appetite had growne
By what is fed on; and yet within a month?
Let me not thinke on't: Frailty, thy name is woman.
A little Month, or ere those shooes were old,
With which she followed my poore Fathers body
Like Niobe, all teares. Why she, euen she.
(O Heauen! A beast that wants discourse of Reason
Would haue mourn'd longer) married with mine Vnkle,
My Fathers Brother: but no more like my Father,
Then I to Hercules. Within a Moneth?
Ere yet the salt of most vnrighteous Teares
Had left the flushing of her gauled eyes,
She married. O most wicked speed, to post
With such dexterity to Incestuous sheets:
It is not, nor it cannot come to good.
But breake my heart, for I must hold my tongue.
Enter Horatio, Barnardo, and Marcellus.

  Hor. Haile to your Lordship

   Ham. I am glad to see you well:
Horatio, or I do forget my selfe

   Hor. The same my Lord,
And your poore Seruant euer

   Ham. Sir my good friend,
Ile change that name with you:
And what make you from Wittenberg Horatio?
Marcellus

   Mar. My good Lord

   Ham. I am very glad to see you: good euen Sir.
But what in faith make you from Wittemberge?
  Hor. A truant disposition, good my Lord

   Ham. I would not haue your Enemy say so;
Nor shall you doe mine eare that violence,
To make it truster of your owne report
Against your selfe. I know you are no Truant:
But what is your affaire in Elsenour?
Wee'l teach you to drinke deepe, ere you depart

   Hor. My Lord, I came to see your Fathers Funerall

   Ham. I pray thee doe not mock me (fellow Student)
I thinke it was to see my Mothers Wedding

   Hor. Indeed my Lord, it followed hard vpon

   Ham. Thrift thrift Horatio: the Funerall Bakt-meats
Did coldly furnish forth the Marriage Tables;
Would I had met my dearest foe in heauen,
Ere I had euer seene that day Horatio.
My father, me thinkes I see my father

   Hor. Oh where my Lord?
  Ham. In my minds eye (Horatio)
  Hor. I saw him once; he was a goodly King

   Ham. He was a man, take him for all in all:
I shall not look vpon his like againe

   Hor. My Lord, I thinke I saw him yesternight

   Ham. Saw? Who?
  Hor. My Lord, the King your Father

   Ham. The King my Father?
  Hor. Season your admiration for a while
With an attent eare; till I may deliuer
Vpon the witnesse of these Gentlemen,
This maruell to you

   Ham. For Heauens loue let me heare

   Hor. Two nights together, had these Gentlemen
(Marcellus and Barnardo) on their Watch
In the dead wast and middle of the night
Beene thus encountred. A figure like your Father,
Arm'd at all points exactly, Cap a Pe,
Appeares before them, and with sollemne march
Goes slow and stately: By them thrice he walkt,
By their opprest and feare-surprized eyes,
Within his Truncheons length; whilst they bestil'd
Almost to Ielly with the Act of feare,
Stand dumbe and speake not to him. This to me
In dreadfull secrecie impart they did,
And I with them the third Night kept the Watch,
Whereas they had deliuer'd both in time,
Forme of the thing; each word made true and good,
The Apparition comes. I knew your Father:
These hands are not more like

   Ham. But where was this?
  Mar. My Lord vpon the platforme where we watcht

   Ham. Did you not speake to it?
  Hor. My Lord, I did;
But answere made it none: yet once me thought
It lifted vp it head, and did addresse
It selfe to motion, like as it would speake:
But euen then, the Morning Cocke crew lowd;
And at the sound it shrunke in hast away,
And vanisht from our sight

   Ham. Tis very strange

   Hor. As I doe liue my honourd Lord 'tis true;
And we did thinke it writ downe in our duty
To let you know of it

   Ham. Indeed, indeed Sirs; but this troubles me.
Hold you the watch to Night?
  Both. We doe my Lord

   Ham. Arm'd, say you?
  Both. Arm'd, my Lord

   Ham. From top to toe?
  Both. My Lord, from head to foote

   Ham. Then saw you not his face?
  Hor. O yes, my Lord, he wore his Beauer vp

   Ham. What, lookt he frowningly?
  Hor. A countenance more in sorrow then in anger

   Ham. Pale, or red?
  Hor. Nay very pale

   Ham. And fixt his eyes vpon you?
  Hor. Most constantly

   Ham. I would I had beene there

   Hor. It would haue much amaz'd you

   Ham. Very like, very like: staid it long?
  Hor. While one with moderate hast might tell a hundred

   All. Longer, longer

   Hor. Not when I saw't

   Ham. His Beard was grisly? no

   Hor. It was, as I haue seene it in his life,
A Sable Siluer'd

   Ham. Ile watch to Night; perchance 'twill wake againe

   Hor. I warrant you it will

   Ham. If it assume my noble Fathers person,
Ile speake to it, though Hell it selfe should gape
And bid me hold my peace. I pray you all,
If you haue hitherto conceald this sight;
Let it bee treble in your silence still:
And whatsoeuer els shall hap to night,
Giue it an vnderstanding but no tongue;
I will requite your loues; so fare ye well:
Vpon the Platforme twixt eleuen and twelue,
Ile visit you

   All. Our duty to your Honour.

Exeunt

   Ham. Your loue, as mine to you: farewell.
My Fathers Spirit in Armes? All is not well:
I doubt some foule play: would the Night were come;
Till then sit still my soule; foule deeds will rise,
Though all the earth orewhelm them to mens eies.
Enter.


Scena Tertia


Enter Laertes and Ophelia.

  Laer. My necessaries are imbark't; Farewell:
And Sister, as the Winds giue Benefit,
And Conuoy is assistant; doe not sleepe,
But let me heare from you

   Ophel. Doe you doubt that?
  Laer. For Hamlet, and the trifling of his fauours,
Hold it a fashion and a toy in Bloude;
A Violet in the youth of Primy Nature;
Froward, not permanent; sweet not lasting
The suppliance of a minute? No more

   Ophel. No more but so

   Laer. Thinke it no more:
For nature cressant does not grow alone,
In thewes and Bulke: but as his Temple waxes,
The inward seruice of the Minde and Soule
Growes wide withall. Perhaps he loues you now,
And now no soyle nor cautell doth besmerch
The vertue of his feare: but you must feare
His greatnesse weigh'd, his will is not his owne;
For hee himselfe is subiect to his Birth:
Hee may not, as vnuallued persons doe,
Carue for himselfe; for, on his choyce depends
The sanctity and health of the whole State.
And therefore must his choyce be circumscrib'd
Vnto the voyce and yeelding of that Body,
Whereof he is the Head. Then if he sayes he loues you,
It fits your wisedome so farre to beleeue it;
As he in his peculiar Sect and force
May giue his saying deed: which is no further,
Then the maine voyce of Denmarke goes withall.
Then weight what losse your Honour may sustaine,
If with too credent eare you list his Songs;
Or lose your Heart; or your chast Treasure open
To his vnmastred importunity.
Feare it Ophelia, feare it my deare Sister,
And keepe within the reare of your Affection;
Out of the shot and danger of Desire.
The chariest Maid is Prodigall enough,
If she vnmaske her beauty to the Moone:
Vertue it selfe scapes not calumnious stroakes,
The Canker Galls, the Infants of the Spring
Too oft before the buttons be disclos'd,
And in the Morne and liquid dew of Youth,
Contagious blastments are most imminent.
Be wary then, best safety lies in feare;
Youth to it selfe rebels, though none else neere

   Ophe. I shall th' effect of this good Lesson keepe,
As watchmen to my heart: but good my Brother
Doe not as some vngracious Pastors doe,
Shew me the steepe and thorny way to Heauen;
Whilst like a puft and recklesse Libertine
Himselfe, the Primrose path of dalliance treads,
And reaks not his owne reade

   Laer. Oh, feare me not.
Enter Polonius.

I stay too long; but here my Father comes:
A double blessing is a double grace;
Occasion smiles vpon a second leaue

   Polon. Yet heere Laertes? Aboord, aboord for shame,
The winde sits in the shoulder of your saile,
And you are staid for there: my blessing with you;
And these few Precepts in thy memory,
See thou Character. Giue thy thoughts no tongue,
Nor any vnproportion'd thoughts his Act:
Be thou familiar; but by no meanes vulgar:
The friends thou hast, and their adoption tride,
Grapple them to thy Soule, with hoopes of Steele:
But doe not dull thy palme, with entertainment
Of each vnhatch't, vnfledg'd Comrade. Beware
Of entrance to a quarrell: but being in
Bear't that th' opposed may beware of thee.
Giue euery man thine eare; but few thy voyce:
Take each mans censure; but reserue thy iudgement:
Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy;
But not exprest in fancie; rich, not gawdie:
For the Apparell oft proclaimes the man.
And they in France of the best ranck and station,
Are of a most select and generous cheff in that.
Neither a borrower, nor a lender be;
For lone oft loses both it selfe and friend:
And borrowing duls the edge of Husbandry.
This aboue all; to thine owne selfe be true:
And it must follow, as the Night the Day,
Thou canst not then be false to any man.
Farewell: my Blessing season this in thee

   Laer. Most humbly doe I take my leaue, my Lord

   Polon. The time inuites you, goe, your seruants tend

   Laer. Farewell Ophelia, and remember well
What I haue said to you

   Ophe. Tis in my memory lockt,
And you your selfe shall keepe the key of it

   Laer. Farewell.

Exit Laer.

  Polon. What ist Ophelia he hath said to you?
  Ophe. So please you, somthing touching the L[ord]. Hamlet

   Polon. Marry, well bethought:
Tis told me he hath very oft of late
Giuen priuate time to you; and you your selfe
Haue of your audience beene most free and bounteous.
If it be so, as so tis put on me;
And that in way of caution: I must tell you,
You doe not vnderstand your selfe so cleerely,
As it behoues my Daughter, and your Honour.
What is betweene you, giue me vp the truth?
  Ophe. He hath my Lord of late, made many tenders
Of his affection to me

   Polon. Affection, puh. You speake like a greene Girle,
Vnsifted in such perillous Circumstance.
Doe you beleeue his tenders, as you call them?
  Ophe. I do not know, my Lord, what I should thinke

   Polon. Marry Ile teach you; thinke your selfe a Baby,
That you haue tane his tenders for true pay,
Which are not starling. Tender your selfe more dearly;
Or not to crack the winde of the poore Phrase,
Roaming it thus, you'l tender me a foole

   Ophe. My Lord, he hath importun'd me with loue,
In honourable fashion

   Polon. I, fashion you may call it, go too, go too

   Ophe. And hath giuen countenance to his speech,
My Lord, with all the vowes of Heauen

   Polon. I, Springes to catch Woodcocks. I doe know
When the Bloud burnes, how Prodigall the Soule
Giues the tongue vowes: these blazes, Daughter,
Giuing more light then heate; extinct in both,
Euen in their promise, as it is a making;
You must not take for fire. For this time Daughter,
Be somewhat scanter of your Maiden presence;
Set your entreatments at a higher rate,
Then a command to parley. For Lord Hamlet,
Beleeue so much in him, that he is young,
And with a larger tether may he walke,
Then may be giuen you. In few, Ophelia,
Doe not beleeue his vowes; for they are Broakers,
Not of the eye, which their Inuestments show:
But meere implorators of vnholy Sutes,
Breathing like sanctified and pious bonds,
The better to beguile. This is for all:
I would not, in plaine tearmes, from this time forth,
Haue you so slander any moment leisure,
As to giue words or talke with the Lord Hamlet:
Looke too't, I charge you; come your wayes

   Ophe. I shall obey my Lord.

Exeunt.

Enter Hamlet, Horatio, Marcellus.

  Ham. The Ayre bites shrewdly: is it very cold?
  Hor. It is a nipping and an eager ayre

   Ham. What hower now?
  Hor. I thinke it lacks of twelue

   Mar. No, it is strooke

   Hor. Indeed I heard it not: then it drawes neere the season,
Wherein the Spirit held his wont to walke.
What does this meane my Lord?
  Ham. The King doth wake to night, and takes his rouse,
Keepes wassels and the swaggering vpspring reeles,
And as he dreines his draughts of Renish downe,
The kettle Drum and Trumpet thus bray out
The triumph of his Pledge

   Horat. Is it a custome?
  Ham. I marry ist;
And to my mind, though I am natiue heere,
And to the manner borne: It is a Custome
More honour'd in the breach, then the obseruance.
Enter Ghost.

  Hor. Looke my Lord, it comes

   Ham. Angels and Ministers of Grace defend vs:
Be thou a Spirit of health, or Goblin damn'd,
Bring with thee ayres from Heauen, or blasts from Hell,
Be thy euents wicked or charitable,
Thou com'st in such a questionable shape
That I will speake to thee. Ile call thee Hamlet,
King, Father, Royall Dane: Oh, oh, answer me,
Let me not burst in Ignorance; but tell
Why thy Canoniz'd bones Hearsed in death,
Haue burst their cerments, why the Sepulcher
Wherein we saw thee quietly enurn'd,
Hath op'd his ponderous and Marble iawes,
To cast thee vp againe? What may this meane?
That thou dead Coarse againe in compleat steele,
Reuisits thus the glimpses of the Moone,
Making Night hidious? And we fooles of Nature,
So horridly to shake our disposition,
With thoughts beyond thee; reaches of our Soules,
Say, why is this? wherefore? what should we doe?

Ghost beckens Hamlet.

  Hor. It beckons you to goe away with it,
As if it some impartment did desire
To you alone

   Mar. Looke with what courteous action
It wafts you to a more remoued ground:
But doe not goe with it

   Hor. No, by no meanes

   Ham. It will not speake: then will I follow it

   Hor. Doe not my Lord

   Ham. Why, what should be the feare?
I doe not set my life at a pins fee;
And for my Soule, what can it doe to that?
Being a thing immortall as it selfe:
It waues me forth againe; Ile follow it

   Hor. What if it tempt you toward the Floud my Lord?
Or to the dreadfull Sonnet of the Cliffe,
That beetles o're his base into the Sea,
And there assumes some other horrible forme,
Which might depriue your Soueraignty of Reason,
And draw you into madnesse thinke of it?
  Ham. It wafts me still: goe on, Ile follow thee

   Mar. You shall not goe my Lord

   Ham. Hold off your hand

   Hor. Be rul'd, you shall not goe

   Ham. My fate cries out,
And makes each petty Artire in this body,
As hardy as the Nemian Lions nerue:
Still am I cal'd? Vnhand me Gentlemen:
By Heau'n, Ile make a Ghost of him that lets me:
I say away, goe on, Ile follow thee.

Exeunt. Ghost & Hamlet.

  Hor. He waxes desperate with imagination

   Mar. Let's follow; 'tis not fit thus to obey him

   Hor. Haue after, to what issue will this come?
  Mar. Something is rotten in the State of Denmarke

   Hor. Heauen will direct it

   Mar. Nay, let's follow him.

Exeunt.

Enter Ghost and Hamlet.

  Ham. Where wilt thou lead me? speak; Ile go no further

   Gho. Marke me

   Ham. I will

   Gho. My hower is almost come,
When I to sulphurous and tormenting Flames
Must render vp my selfe

   Ham. Alas poore Ghost

   Gho. Pitty me not, but lend thy serious hearing
To what I shall vnfold

   Ham. Speake, I am bound to heare

   Gho. So art thou to reuenge, when thou shalt heare

   Ham. What?
  Gho. I am thy Fathers Spirit,
Doom'd for a certaine terme to walke the night;
And for the day confin'd to fast in Fiers,
Till the foule crimes done in my dayes of Nature
Are burnt and purg'd away? But that I am forbid
To tell the secrets of my Prison-House;
I could a Tale vnfold, whose lightest word
Would harrow vp thy soule, freeze thy young blood,
Make thy two eyes like Starres, start from their Spheres,
Thy knotty and combined lockes to part,
And each particular haire to stand an end,
Like Quilles vpon the fretfull Porpentine:
But this eternall blason must not be
To eares of flesh and bloud; list Hamlet, oh list,
If thou didst euer thy deare Father loue

   Ham. Oh Heauen!
  Gho. Reuenge his foule and most vnnaturall Murther

   Ham. Murther?
  Ghost. Murther most foule, as in the best it is;
But this most foule, strange, and vnnaturall

   Ham. Hast, hast me to know it,
That with wings as swift
As meditation, or the thoughts of Loue,
May sweepe to my Reuenge

   Ghost. I finde thee apt,
And duller should'st thou be then the fat weede
That rots it selfe in ease, on Lethe Wharfe,
Would'st thou not stirre in this. Now Hamlet heare:
It's giuen out, that sleeping in mine Orchard,
A Serpent stung me: so the whole eare of Denmarke,
Is by a forged processe of my death
Rankly abus'd: But know thou Noble youth,
The Serpent that did sting thy Fathers life,
Now weares his Crowne

   Ham. O my Propheticke soule: mine Vncle?
  Ghost. I that incestuous, that adulterate Beast
With witchcraft of his wits, hath Traitorous guifts.
Oh wicked Wit, and Gifts, that haue the power
So to seduce? Won to this shamefull Lust
The will of my most seeming vertuous Queene:
Oh Hamlet, what a falling off was there,
From me, whose loue was of that dignity,
That it went hand in hand, euen with the Vow
I made to her in Marriage; and to decline
Vpon a wretch, whose Naturall gifts were poore
To those of mine. But Vertue, as it neuer wil be moued,
Though Lewdnesse court it in a shape of Heauen:
So Lust, though to a radiant Angell link'd,
Will sate it selfe in a Celestiall bed, & prey on Garbage.
But soft, me thinkes I sent the Mornings Ayre;
Briefe let me be: Sleeping within mine Orchard,
My custome alwayes in the afternoone;
Vpon my secure hower thy Vncle stole
With iuyce of cursed Hebenon in a Violl,
And in the Porches of mine eares did poure
The leaperous Distilment; whose effect
Holds such an enmity with bloud of Man,
That swift as Quick-siluer, it courses through
The naturall Gates and Allies of the body;
And with a sodaine vigour it doth posset
And curd, like Aygre droppings into Milke,
The thin and wholsome blood: so did it mine;
And a most instant Tetter bak'd about,
Most Lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust,
All my smooth Body.
Thus was I, sleeping, by a Brothers hand,
Of Life, of Crowne, and Queene at once dispatcht;
Cut off euen in the Blossomes of my Sinne,
Vnhouzzled, disappointed, vnnaneld,
No reckoning made, but sent to my account
With all my imperfections on my head;
Oh horrible Oh horrible, most horrible:
If thou hast nature in thee beare it not;
Let not the Royall Bed of Denmarke be
A Couch for Luxury and damned Incest.
But howsoeuer thou pursuest this Act,
Taint not thy mind; nor let thy Soule contriue
Against thy Mother ought; leaue her to heauen,
And to those Thornes that in her bosome lodge,
To pricke and sting her. Fare thee well at once;
The Glow-worme showes the Matine to be neere,
And gins to pale his vneffectuall Fire:
Adue, adue, Hamlet: remember me.
Enter.

  Ham. Oh all you host of Heauen! Oh Earth; what els?
And shall I couple Hell? Oh fie: hold my heart;
And you my sinnewes, grow not instant Old;
But beare me stiffely vp: Remember thee?
I, thou poore Ghost, while memory holds a seate
In this distracted Globe: Remember thee?
Yea, from the Table of my Memory,
Ile wipe away all triuiall fond Records,
All sawes of Bookes, all formes, all presures past,
That youth and obseruation coppied there;
And thy Commandment all alone shall liue
Within the Booke and Volume of my Braine,
Vnmixt with baser matter; yes yes, by Heauen:
Oh most pernicious woman!
Oh Villaine, Villaine, smiling damned Villaine!
My Tables, my Tables; meet it is I set it downe,
That one may smile, and smile and be a Villaine;
At least I'm sure it may be so in Denmarke;
So Vnckle there you are: now to my word;
It is; Adue, Adue, Remember me: I haue sworn't

   Hor. & Mar. within. My Lord, my Lord.
Enter Horatio and Marcellus.

  Mar. Lord Hamlet

   Hor. Heauen secure him

   Mar. So be it

   Hor. Illo, ho, ho, my Lord

   Ham. Hillo, ho, ho, boy; come bird, come

   Mar. How ist my Noble Lord?
  Hor. What newes, my Lord?
  Ham. Oh wonderfull!
  Hor. Good my Lord tell it

   Ham. No you'l reueale it

   Hor. Not I, my Lord, by Heauen

   Mar. Nor I, my Lord

   Ham. How say you then, would heart of man once think it?
But you'l be secret?
  Both. I, by Heau'n, my Lord

   Ham. There's nere a villaine dwelling in all Denmarke
But hee's an arrant knaue

   Hor. There needs no Ghost my Lord, come from the
Graue, to tell vs this

   Ham. Why right, you are i'th' right;
And so, without more circumstance at all,
I hold it fit that we shake hands, and part:
You, as your busines and desires shall point you:
For euery man ha's businesse and desire,
Such as it is: and for mine owne poore part,
Looke you, Ile goe pray

   Hor. These are but wild and hurling words, my Lord

   Ham. I'm sorry they offend you heartily:
Yes faith, heartily

   Hor. There's no offence my Lord

   Ham. Yes, by Saint Patricke, but there is my Lord,
And much offence too, touching this Vision heere:
It is an honest Ghost, that let me tell you:
For your desire to know what is betweene vs,
O'remaster't as you may. And now good friends,
As you are Friends, Schollers and Soldiers,
Giue me one poore request

   Hor. What is't my Lord? we will

   Ham. Neuer make known what you haue seen to night

   Both. My Lord, we will not

   Ham. Nay, but swear't

   Hor. Infaith my Lord, not I

   Mar. Nor I my Lord: in faith

   Ham. Vpon my sword

   Marcell. We haue sworne my Lord already

   Ham. Indeed, vpon my sword, Indeed

   Gho. Sweare.

Ghost cries vnder the Stage.

  Ham. Ah ha boy, sayest thou so. Art thou there truepenny?
Come one you here this fellow in the selleredge
Consent to sweare

   Hor. Propose the Oath my Lord

   Ham. Neuer to speake of this that you haue seene.
Sweare by my sword

   Gho. Sweare

   Ham. Hic & vbique? Then wee'l shift for grownd,
Come hither Gentlemen,
And lay your hands againe vpon my sword,
Neuer to speake of this that you haue heard:
Sweare by my Sword

   Gho. Sweare

   Ham. Well said old Mole, can'st worke i'th' ground so fast?
A worthy Pioner, once more remoue good friends

   Hor. Oh day and night: but this is wondrous strange

   Ham. And therefore as a stranger giue it welcome.
There are more things in Heauen and Earth, Horatio,
Then are dream't of in our Philosophy. But come,
Here as before, neuer so helpe you mercy,
How strange or odde so ere I beare my selfe;
(As I perchance heereafter shall thinke meet
To put an Anticke disposition on:)
That you at such time seeing me, neuer shall
With Armes encombred thus, or thus, head shake;
Or by pronouncing of some doubtfull Phrase;
As well, we know, or we could and if we would,
Or if we list to speake; or there be and if there might,
Or such ambiguous giuing out to note,
That you know ought of me; this not to doe:
So grace and mercy at your most neede helpe you:
Sweare

   Ghost. Sweare

   Ham. Rest, rest perturbed Spirit: so Gentlemen,
With all my loue I doe commend me to you;
And what so poore a man as Hamlet is,
May doe t' expresse his loue and friending to you,
God willing shall not lacke: let vs goe in together,
And still your fingers on your lippes I pray,
The time is out of ioynt: Oh cursed spight,
That euer I was borne to set it right.
Nay, come let's goe together.

Exeunt.


Actus Secundus.

Enter Polonius, and Reynoldo.

  Polon. Giue him his money, and these notes Reynoldo

   Reynol. I will my Lord

   Polon. You shall doe maruels wisely: good Reynoldo,
Before you visite him you make inquiry
Of his behauiour

   Reynol. My Lord, I did intend it

   Polon. Marry, well said;
Very well said. Looke you Sir,
Enquire me first what Danskers are in Paris;
And how, and who; what meanes; and where they keepe:
What company, at what expence: and finding
By this encompassement and drift of question,
That they doe know my sonne: Come you more neerer
Then your particular demands will touch it,
Take you as 'twere some distant knowledge of him,
And thus I know his father and his friends,
And in part him. Doe you marke this Reynoldo?
  Reynol. I, very well my Lord

   Polon. And in part him, but you may say not well;
But if't be hee I meane, hees very wilde;
Addicted so and so; and there put on him
What forgeries you please; marry, none so ranke,
As may dishonour him; take heed of that:
But Sir, such wanton, wild, and vsuall slips,
As are Companions noted and most knowne
To youth and liberty

   Reynol. As gaming my Lord

   Polon. I, or drinking, fencing, swearing,
Quarelling, drabbing. You may goe so farre

   Reynol. My Lord that would dishonour him

   Polon. Faith no, as you may season it in the charge;
You must not put another scandall on him,
That hee is open to Incontinencie;
That's not my meaning: but breath his faults so quaintly,
That they may seeme the taints of liberty;
The flash and out-breake of a fiery minde,
A sauagenes in vnreclaim'd bloud of generall assault

   Reynol. But my good Lord

   Polon. Wherefore should you doe this?
  Reynol. I my Lord, I would know that

   Polon. Marry Sir, heere's my drift,
And I belieue it is a fetch of warrant:
You laying these slight sulleyes on my Sonne,
As 'twere a thing a little soil'd i'th' working:
Marke you your party in conuerse; him you would sound,
Hauing euer seene. In the prenominate crimes,
The youth you breath of guilty, be assur'd
He closes with you in this consequence:
Good sir, or so, or friend, or Gentleman.
According to the Phrase and the Addition,
Of man and Country

   Reynol. Very good my Lord

   Polon. And then Sir does he this?
He does: what was I about to say?
I was about say somthing: where did I leaue?
  Reynol. At closes in the consequence:
At friend, or so, and Gentleman

   Polon. At closes in the consequence, I marry,
He closes with you thus. I know the Gentleman,
I saw him yesterday, or tother day;
Or then or then, with such and such; and as you say,
There was he gaming, there o'retooke in's Rouse,
There falling out at Tennis; or perchance,
I saw him enter such a house of saile;
Videlicet, a Brothell, or so forth. See you now;
Your bait of falshood, takes this Cape of truth;
And thus doe we of wisedome and of reach
With windlesses, and with assaies of Bias,
By indirections finde directions out:
So by my former Lecture and aduice
Shall you my Sonne; you haue me, haue you not?
  Reynol. My Lord I haue

   Polon. God buy you; fare you well

   Reynol. Good my Lord

   Polon. Obserue his inclination in your selfe

   Reynol. I shall my Lord

   Polon. And let him plye his Musicke

   Reynol. Well, my Lord.
Enter.

Enter Ophelia.

  Polon. Farewell:
How now Ophelia, what's the matter?
  Ophe. Alas my Lord, I haue beene so affrighted

   Polon. With what, in the name of Heauen?
  Ophe. My Lord, as I was sowing in my Chamber,
Lord Hamlet with his doublet all vnbrac'd,
No hat vpon his head, his stockings foul'd,
Vngartred, and downe giued to his Anckle,
Pale as his shirt, his knees knocking each other,
And with a looke so pitious in purport,
As if he had been loosed out of hell,
To speake of horrors: he comes before me

   Polon. Mad for thy Loue?
  Ophe. My Lord, I doe not know: but truly I do feare it

   Polon. What said he?
  Ophe. He tooke me by the wrist, and held me hard;
Then goes he to the length of all his arme;
And with his other hand thus o're his brow,
He fals to such perusall of my face,
As he would draw it. Long staid he so,
At last, a little shaking of mine Arme:
And thrice his head thus wauing vp and downe;
He rais'd a sigh, so pittious and profound,
That it did seeme to shatter all his bulke,
And end his being. That done, he lets me goe,
And with his head ouer his shoulders turn'd,
He seem'd to finde his way without his eyes,
For out adores he went without their helpe;
And to the last, bended their light on me

   Polon. Goe with me, I will goe seeke the King,
This is the very extasie of Loue,
Whose violent property foredoes it selfe,
And leads the will to desperate Vndertakings,
As oft as any passion vnder Heauen,
That does afflict our Natures. I am sorrie,
What haue you giuen him any hard words of late?
  Ophe. No my good Lord: but as you did command,
I did repell his Letters, and deny'de
His accesse to me

   Pol. That hath made him mad.
I am sorrie that with better speed and iudgement
I had not quoted him. I feare he did but trifle,
And meant to wracke thee: but beshrew my iealousie:
It seemes it is as proper to our Age,
To cast beyond our selues in our Opinions,
As it is common for the yonger sort
To lacke discretion. Come, go we to the King,
This must be knowne, being kept close might moue
More greefe to hide, then hate to vtter loue.

Exeunt.


Scena Secunda.

Enter King, Queene, Rosincrane, and Guildensterne Cum alijs.

  King. Welcome deere Rosincrance and Guildensterne.
Moreouer, that we much did long to see you,
The neede we haue to vse you, did prouoke
Our hastie sending. Something haue you heard
Of Hamlets transformation: so I call it,
Since not th' exterior, nor the inward man
Resembles that it was. What it should bee
More then his Fathers death, that thus hath put him
So much from th' vnderstanding of himselfe,
I cannot deeme of. I intreat you both,
That being of so young dayes brought vp with him:
And since so Neighbour'd to his youth, and humour,
That you vouchsafe your rest heere in our Court
Some little time: so by your Companies
To draw him on to pleasures, and to gather
So much as from Occasions you may gleane,
That open'd lies within our remedie

   Qu. Good Gentlemen, he hath much talk'd of you,
And sure I am, two men there are not liuing,
To whom he more adheres. If it will please you
To shew vs so much Gentrie, and good will,
As to expend your time with vs a-while,
For the supply and profit of our Hope,
Your Visitation shall receiue such thankes
As fits a Kings remembrance

   Rosin. Both your Maiesties
Might by the Soueraigne power you haue of vs,
Put your dread pleasures, more into Command
Then to Entreatie

   Guil. We both obey,
And here giue vp our selues, in the full bent,
To lay our Seruices freely at your feete,
To be commanded

   King. Thankes Rosincrance, and gentle Guildensterne

   Qu. Thankes Guildensterne and gentle Rosincrance.
And I beseech you instantly to visit
My too much changed Sonne.
Go some of ye,
And bring the Gentlemen where Hamlet is

   Guil. Heauens make our presence and our practises
Pleasant and helpfull to him.
Enter.

  Queene. Amen.
Enter Polonius.

  Pol. Th' Ambassadors from Norwey, my good Lord,
Are ioyfully return'd

   King. Thou still hast bin the father of good Newes

   Pol. Haue I, my Lord? Assure you, my good Liege,
I hold my dutie, as I hold my Soule,
Both to my God, one to my gracious King:
And I do thinke, or else this braine of mine
Hunts not the traile of Policie, so sure
As I haue vs'd to do: that I haue found
The very cause of Hamlets Lunacie

   King. Oh speake of that, that I do long to heare

   Pol. Giue first admittance to th' Ambassadors,
My Newes shall be the Newes to that great Feast

   King. Thy selfe do grace to them, and bring them in.
He tels me my sweet Queene, that he hath found
The head and sourse of all your Sonnes distemper

   Qu. I doubt it is no other, but the maine,
His Fathers death, and our o're-hasty Marriage.
Enter Polonius, Voltumand, and Cornelius.

  King. Well, we shall sift him. Welcome good Frends:
Say Voltumand, what from our Brother Norwey?
  Volt. Most faire returne of Greetings, and Desires.
Vpon our first, he sent out to suppresse
His Nephewes Leuies, which to him appear'd
To be a preparation 'gainst the Poleak:
But better look'd into, he truly found
It was against your Highnesse, whereat greeued,
That so his Sicknesse, Age, and Impotence
Was falsely borne in hand, sends out Arrests
On Fortinbras, which he (in breefe) obeyes,
Receiues rebuke from Norwey: and in fine,
Makes Vow before his Vnkle, neuer more
To giue th' assay of Armes against your Maiestie.
Whereon old Norwey, ouercome with ioy,
Giues him three thousand Crownes in Annuall Fee,
And his Commission to imploy those Soldiers
So leuied as before, against the Poleak:
With an intreaty heerein further shewne,
That it might please you to giue quiet passe
Through your Dominions, for his Enterprize,
On such regards of safety and allowance,
As therein are set downe

   King. It likes vs well:
And at our more consider'd time wee'l read,
Answer, and thinke vpon this Businesse.
Meane time we thanke you, for your well-tooke Labour.
Go to your rest, at night wee'l Feast together.
Most welcome home.

Exit Ambass.

  Pol. This businesse is very well ended.
My Liege, and Madam, to expostulate
What Maiestie should be, what Dutie is,
Why day is day; night, night; and time is time,
Were nothing but to waste Night, Day, and Time.
Therefore, since Breuitie is the Soule of Wit,
And tediousnesse, the limbes and outward flourishes,
I will be breefe. Your Noble Sonne is mad:
Mad call I it; for to define true Madnesse,
What is't, but to be nothing else but mad.
But let that go

   Qu. More matter, with lesse Art

   Pol. Madam, I sweare I vse no Art at all:
That he is mad, 'tis true: 'Tis true 'tis pittie,
And pittie it is true: A foolish figure,
But farewell it: for I will vse no Art.
Mad let vs grant him then: and now remaines
That we finde out the cause of this effect,
Or rather say, the cause of this defect;
For this effect defectiue, comes by cause,
Thus it remaines, and the remainder thus. Perpend,
I haue a daughter: haue, whil'st she is mine,
Who in her Dutie and Obedience, marke,
Hath giuen me this: now gather, and surmise.

The Letter.

To the Celestiall, and my Soules Idoll, the most beautifed Ophelia.
That's an ill Phrase, a vilde Phrase, beautified is a vilde
Phrase: but you shall heare these in her excellent white
bosome, these

   Qu. Came this from Hamlet to her

   Pol. Good Madam stay awhile, I will be faithfull.
Doubt thou, the Starres are fire,
Doubt, that the Sunne doth moue:
Doubt Truth to be a Lier,
But neuer Doubt, I loue.
O deere Ophelia, I am ill at these Numbers: I haue not Art to
reckon my grones; but that I loue thee best, oh most Best beleeue
it. Adieu.
Thine euermore most deere Lady, whilst this
Machine is to him, Hamlet.
This in Obedience hath my daughter shew'd me:
And more aboue hath his soliciting,
As they fell out by Time, by Meanes, and Place,
All giuen to mine eare

   King. But how hath she receiu'd his Loue?
  Pol. What do you thinke of me?
  King. As of a man, faithfull and Honourable

   Pol. I wold faine proue so. But what might you think?
When I had seene this hot loue on the wing,
As I perceiued it, I must tell you that
Before my Daughter told me what might you
Or my deere Maiestie your Queene heere, think,
If I had playd the Deske or Table-booke,
Or giuen my heart a winking, mute and dumbe,
Or look'd vpon this Loue, with idle sight,
What might you thinke? No, I went round to worke,
And (my yong Mistris) thus I did bespeake
Lord Hamlet is a Prince out of thy Starre,
This must not be: and then, I Precepts gaue her,
That she should locke her selfe from his Resort,
Admit no Messengers, receiue no Tokens:
Which done, she tooke the Fruites of my Aduice,
And he repulsed. A short Tale to make,
Fell into a Sadnesse, then into a Fast,
Thence to a Watch, thence into a Weaknesse,
Thence to a Lightnesse, and by this declension
Into the Madnesse whereon now he raues,
And all we waile for

   King. Do you thinke 'tis this?
  Qu. It may be very likely

   Pol. Hath there bene such a time, I'de fain know that,
That I haue possitiuely said, 'tis so,
When it prou'd otherwise?
  King. Not that I know

   Pol. Take this from this; if this be otherwise,
If Circumstances leade me, I will finde
Where truth is hid, though it were hid indeede
Within the Center

   King. How may we try it further?
  Pol. You know sometimes
He walkes foure houres together, heere
In the Lobby

   Qu. So he ha's indeed

   Pol. At such a time Ile loose my Daughter to him,
Be you and I behinde an Arras then,
Marke the encounter: If he loue her not,
And be not from his reason falne thereon;
Let me be no Assistant for a State,
And keepe a Farme and Carters

   King. We will try it.
Enter Hamlet reading on a Booke.

  Qu. But looke where sadly the poore wretch
Comes reading

   Pol. Away I do beseech you, both away,
Ile boord him presently.

Exit King & Queen.

Oh giue me leaue. How does my good Lord Hamlet?
  Ham. Well, God-a-mercy

   Pol. Do you know me, my Lord?
  Ham. Excellent, excellent well: y'are a Fishmonger

   Pol. Not I my Lord

   Ham. Then I would you were so honest a man

   Pol. Honest, my Lord?
  Ham. I sir, to be honest as this world goes, is to bee
one man pick'd out of two thousand

   Pol. That's very true, my Lord

   Ham. For if the Sun breed Magots in a dead dogge,
being a good kissing Carrion-
Haue you a daughter?
  Pol. I haue my Lord

   Ham. Let her not walke i'thSunne: Conception is a
blessing, but not as your daughter may conceiue. Friend
looke too't

   Pol. How say you by that? Still harping on my daughter:
yet he knew me not at first; he said I was a Fishmonger:
he is farre gone, farre gone: and truly in my youth,
I suffred much extreamity for loue: very neere this. Ile
speake to him againe. What do you read my Lord?
  Ham. Words, words, words

   Pol. What is the matter, my Lord?
  Ham. Betweene who?
  Pol. I meane the matter you meane, my Lord

   Ham. Slanders Sir: for the Satyricall slaue saies here,
that old men haue gray Beards; that their faces are wrinkled;
their eyes purging thicke Amber, or Plum-Tree
Gumme: and that they haue a plentifull locke of Wit,
together with weake Hammes. All which Sir, though I
most powerfully, and potently beleeue; yet I holde it
not Honestie to haue it thus set downe: For you your
selfe Sir, should be old as I am, if like a Crab you could
go backward

   Pol. Though this be madnesse,
Yet there is Method in't: will you walke
Out of the ayre my Lord?
  Ham. Into my Graue?
  Pol. Indeed that is out o'th' Ayre:
How pregnant (sometimes) his Replies are?
A happinesse,
That often Madnesse hits on,
Which Reason and Sanitie could not
So prosperously be deliuer'd of.
I will leaue him,
And sodainely contriue the meanes of meeting
Betweene him, and my daughter.
My Honourable Lord, I will most humbly
Take my leaue of you

   Ham. You cannot Sir take from me any thing, that I
will more willingly part withall, except my life, my
life

   Polon. Fare you well my Lord

   Ham. These tedious old fooles

   Polon. You goe to seeke my Lord Hamlet; there
hee is.
Enter Rosincran and Guildensterne.

  Rosin. God saue you Sir

   Guild. Mine honour'd Lord?
  Rosin. My most deare Lord?
  Ham. My excellent good friends? How do'st thou
Guildensterne? Oh, Rosincrane; good Lads: How doe ye
both?
  Rosin. As the indifferent Children of the earth

   Guild. Happy, in that we are not ouer-happy: on Fortunes
Cap, we are not the very Button

   Ham. Nor the Soales of her Shoo?
  Rosin. Neither my Lord

   Ham. Then you liue about her waste, or in the middle
of her fauour?
  Guil. Faith, her priuates, we

   Ham. In the secret parts of Fortune? Oh, most true:
she is a Strumpet. What's the newes?
  Rosin. None my Lord; but that the World's growne
honest

   Ham. Then is Doomesday neere: But your newes is
not true. Let me question more in particular: what haue
you my good friends, deserued at the hands of Fortune,
that she sends you to Prison hither?
  Guil. Prison, my Lord?
  Ham. Denmark's a Prison

   Rosin. Then is the World one

   Ham. A goodly one, in which there are many Confines,
Wards, and Dungeons; Denmarke being one o'th'
worst

   Rosin. We thinke not so my Lord

   Ham. Why then 'tis none to you; for there is nothing
either good or bad, but thinking makes it so: to me it is
a prison

   Rosin. Why then your Ambition makes it one: 'tis
too narrow for your minde

   Ham. O God, I could be bounded in a nutshell, and
count my selfe a King of infinite space; were it not that
I haue bad dreames

   Guil. Which dreames indeed are Ambition: for the
very substance of the Ambitious, is meerely the shadow
of a Dreame

   Ham. A dreame it selfe is but a shadow

   Rosin. Truely, and I hold Ambition of so ayry and
light a quality, that it is but a shadowes shadow

   Ham. Then are our Beggers bodies; and our Monarchs
and out-stretcht Heroes the Beggers Shadowes:
shall wee to th' Court: for, by my fey I cannot reason?
  Both. Wee'l wait vpon you

   Ham. No such matter. I will not sort you with the
rest of my seruants: for to speake to you like an honest
man: I am most dreadfully attended; but in the beaten
way of friendship, What make you at Elsonower?
  Rosin. To visit you my Lord, no other occasion

   Ham. Begger that I am, I am euen poore in thankes;
but I thanke you: and sure deare friends my thanks
are too deare a halfepeny; were you not sent for? Is it
your owne inclining? Is it a free visitation? Come,
deale iustly with me: come, come; nay speake

   Guil. What should we say my Lord?
  Ham. Why any thing. But to the purpose; you were
sent for; and there is a kinde confession in your lookes;
which your modesties haue not craft enough to color,
I know the good King & Queene haue sent for you

   Rosin. To what end my Lord?
  Ham. That you must teach me: but let mee coniure
you by the rights of our fellowship, by the consonancy of
our youth, by the Obligation of our euer-preserued loue,
and by what more deare, a better proposer could charge
you withall; be euen and direct with me, whether you
were sent for or no

   Rosin. What say you?
  Ham. Nay then I haue an eye of you: if you loue me
hold not off

   Guil. My Lord, we were sent for

   Ham. I will tell you why; so shall my anticipation
preuent your discouery of your secricie to the King and
Queene: moult no feather, I haue of late, but wherefore
I know not, lost all my mirth, forgone all custome of exercise;
and indeed, it goes so heauenly with my disposition;
that this goodly frame the Earth, seemes to me a sterrill
Promontory; this most excellent Canopy the Ayre,
look you, this braue ore-hanging, this Maiesticall Roofe,
fretted with golden fire: why, it appeares no other thing
to mee, then a foule and pestilent congregation of vapours.
What a piece of worke is a man! how Noble in
Reason? how infinite in faculty? in forme and mouing
how expresse and admirable? in Action, how like an Angel?
in apprehension, how like a God? the beauty of the
world, the Parragon of Animals; and yet to me, what is
this Quintessence of Dust? Man delights not me; no,
nor Woman neither; though by your smiling you seeme
to say so

   Rosin. My Lord, there was no such stuffe in my
thoughts

   Ham. Why did you laugh, when I said, Man delights
not me?
  Rosin. To thinke, my Lord, if you delight not in Man,
what Lenton entertainment the Players shall receiue
from you: wee coated them on the way, and hither are
they comming to offer you Seruice

   Ham. He that playes the King shall be welcome; his
Maiesty shall haue Tribute of mee: the aduenturous
Knight shal vse his Foyle and Target: the Louer shall
not sigh gratis, the humorous man shall end his part in
peace: the Clowne shall make those laugh whose lungs
are tickled a'th' sere: and the Lady shall say her minde
freely; or the blanke Verse shall halt for't: what Players
are they?
  Rosin. Euen those you were wont to take delight in
the Tragedians of the City

   Ham. How chances it they trauaile? their residence
both in reputation and profit was better both
wayes

   Rosin. I thinke their Inhibition comes by the meanes
of the late Innouation?
  Ham. Doe they hold the same estimation they did
when I was in the City? Are they so follow'd?
  Rosin. No indeed, they are not

   Ham. How comes it? doe they grow rusty?
  Rosin. Nay, their indeauour keepes in the wonted
pace; But there is Sir an ayrie of Children, little
Yases, that crye out on the top of question; and
are most tyrannically clap't for't: these are now the
fashion, and so be-ratled the common Stages (so they
call them) that many wearing Rapiers, are affraide of
Goose-quils, and dare scarse come thither

   Ham. What are they Children? Who maintains 'em?
How are they escorted? Will they pursue the Quality no
longer then they can sing? Will they not say afterwards
if they should grow themselues to common Players (as
it is most like if their meanes are not better) their Writers
do them wrong, to make them exclaim against their
owne Succession

   Rosin. Faith there ha's bene much to do on both sides:
and the Nation holds it no sinne, to tarre them to Controuersie.
There was for a while, no mony bid for argument,
vnlesse the Poet and the Player went to Cuffes in
the Question

   Ham. Is't possible?
  Guild. Oh there ha's beene much throwing about of
Braines

   Ham. Do the Boyes carry it away?
  Rosin. I that they do my Lord. Hercules & his load too

   Ham. It is not strange: for mine Vnckle is King of
Denmarke, and those that would make mowes at him
while my Father liued; giue twenty, forty, an hundred
Ducates a peece, for his picture in Little. There is something
in this more then Naturall, if Philosophie could
finde it out.

Flourish for the Players.

  Guil. There are the Players

   Ham. Gentlemen, you are welcom to Elsonower: your
hands, come: The appurtenance of Welcome, is Fashion
and Ceremony. Let me comply with you in the Garbe,
lest my extent to the Players (which I tell you must shew
fairely outward) should more appeare like entertainment
then yours. You are welcome: but my Vnckle Father,
and Aunt Mother are deceiu'd

   Guil. In what my deere Lord?
  Ham. I am but mad North, North-West: when the
Winde is Southerly, I know a Hawke from a Handsaw.
Enter Polonius.

  Pol. Well be with you Gentlemen

   Ham. Hearke you Guildensterne, and you too: at each
eare a hearer: that great Baby you see there, is not yet
out of his swathing clouts

   Rosin. Happily he's the second time come to them: for
they say, an old man is twice a childe

   Ham. I will Prophesie. Hee comes to tell me of the
Players. Mark it, you say right Sir: for a Monday morning
'twas so indeed

   Pol. My Lord, I haue Newes to tell you

   Ham. My Lord, I haue Newes to tell you.
When Rossius an Actor in Rome-
  Pol. The Actors are come hither my Lord

   Ham. Buzze, buzze

   Pol. Vpon mine Honor

   Ham. Then can each Actor on his Asse-
  Polon. The best Actors in the world, either for Tragedie,
Comedie, Historie, Pastorall:
Pastoricall-Comicall-Historicall-Pastorall:
Tragicall-Historicall: Tragicall-Comicall-Historicall-Pastorall:
Scene indiuidible: or Poem
vnlimited. Seneca cannot be too heauy, nor Plautus
too light, for the law of Writ, and the Liberty. These are
the onely men

   Ham. O Iephta Iudge of Israel, what a Treasure had'st
thou?
  Pol. What a Treasure had he, my Lord?
  Ham. Why one faire Daughter, and no more,
The which he loued passing well

   Pol. Still on my Daughter

   Ham. Am I not i'th' right old Iephta?
  Polon. If you call me Iephta my Lord, I haue a daughter
that I loue passing well

   Ham. Nay that followes not

   Polon. What followes then, my Lord?
  Ha. Why, As by lot, God wot: and then you know, It
came to passe, as most like it was: The first rowe of the
Pons Chanson will shew you more. For looke where my
Abridgements come.
Enter foure or fiue Players.

Y'are welcome Masters, welcome all. I am glad to see
thee well: Welcome good Friends. Oh my olde Friend?
Thy face is valiant since I saw thee last: Com'st thou to
beard me in Denmarke? What, my yong Lady and Mistris?
Byrlady your Ladiship is neerer Heauen then when
I saw you last, by the altitude of a Choppine. Pray God
your voice like a peece of vncurrant Gold be not crack'd
within the ring. Masters, you are all welcome: wee'l e'ne
to't like French Faulconers, flie at any thing we see: wee'l
haue a Speech straight. Come giue vs a tast of your quality:
come, a passionate speech

   1.Play. What speech, my Lord?
  Ham. I heard thee speak me a speech once, but it was
neuer Acted: or if it was, not aboue once, for the Play I
remember pleas'd not the Million, 'twas Cauiarie to the
Generall: but it was (as I receiu'd it, and others, whose
iudgement in such matters, cried in the top of mine) an
excellent Play; well digested in the Scoenes, set downe
with as much modestie, as cunning. I remember one said,
there was no Sallets in the lines, to make the matter sauory;
nor no matter in the phrase, that might indite the
Author of affectation, but cal'd it an honest method. One
cheefe Speech in it, I cheefely lou'd, 'twas Aeneas Tale
to Dido, and thereabout of it especially, where he speaks
of Priams slaughter. If it liue in your memory, begin at
this Line, let me see, let me see: The rugged Pyrrhus like
th'Hyrcanian Beast. It is not so: it begins with Pyrrhus
The rugged Pyrrhus, he whose Sable Armes
Blacke as his purpose, did the night resemble
When he lay couched in the Ominous Horse,
Hath now this dread and blacke Complexion smear'd
With Heraldry more dismall: Head to foote
Now is he to take Geulles, horridly Trick'd
With blood of Fathers, Mothers, Daughters, Sonnes,
Bak'd and impasted with the parching streets,
That lend a tyrannous, and damned light
To their vilde Murthers, roasted in wrath and fire,
And thus o're-sized with coagulate gore,
With eyes like Carbuncles, the hellish Pyrrhus
Olde Grandsire Priam seekes

   Pol. Fore God, my Lord, well spoken, with good accent,
and good discretion

   1.Player. Anon he findes him,
Striking too short at Greekes. His anticke Sword,
Rebellious to his Arme, lyes where it falles
Repugnant to command: vnequall match,
Pyrrhus at Priam driues, in Rage strikes wide:
But with the whiffe and winde of his fell Sword,
Th' vnnerued Father fals. Then senselesse Illium,
Seeming to feele his blow, with flaming top
Stoopes to his Bace, and with a hideous crash
Takes Prisoner Pyrrhus eare. For loe, his Sword
Which was declining on the Milkie head
Of Reuerend Priam, seem'd i'th' Ayre to sticke:
So as a painted Tyrant Pyrrhus stood,
And like a Newtrall to his will and matter, did nothing.
But as we often see against some storme,
A silence in the Heauens, the Racke stand still,
The bold windes speechlesse, and the Orbe below
As hush as death: Anon the dreadfull Thunder
Doth rend the Region. So after Pyrrhus pause,
A rowsed Vengeance sets him new a-worke,
And neuer did the Cyclops hammers fall
On Mars his Armours, forg'd for proofe Eterne,
With lesse remorse then Pyrrhus bleeding sword
Now falles on Priam.
Out, out, thou Strumpet-Fortune, all you Gods,
In generall Synod take away her power:
Breake all the Spokes and Fallies from her wheele,
And boule the round Naue downe the hill of Heauen,
As low as to the Fiends

   Pol. This is too long

   Ham. It shall to'th Barbars, with your beard. Prythee
say on: He's for a Iigge, or a tale of Baudry, or hee
sleepes. Say on; come to Hecuba

   1.Play. But who, O who, had seen the inobled Queen

   Ham. The inobled Queene?
  Pol. That's good: Inobled Queene is good

   1.Play. Run bare-foot vp and downe,
Threatning the flame
With Bisson Rheume: A clout about that head,
Where late the Diadem stood, and for a Robe
About her lanke and all ore-teamed Loines,
A blanket in th' Alarum of feare caught vp.
Who this had seene, with tongue in Venome steep'd,
'Gainst Fortunes State, would Treason haue pronounc'd?
But if the Gods themselues did see her then,
When she saw Pyrrhus make malicious sport
In mincing with his Sword her Husbands limbes,
The instant Burst of Clamour that she made
(Vnlesse things mortall moue them not at all)
Would haue made milche the Burning eyes of Heauen,
And passion in the Gods

   Pol. Looke where he ha's not turn'd his colour, and
ha's teares in's eyes. Pray you no more

   Ham. 'Tis well, Ile haue thee speake out the rest,
soone. Good my Lord, will you see the Players wel bestow'd.
Do ye heare, let them be well vs'd: for they are
the Abstracts and breefe Chronicles of the time. After
your death, you were better haue a bad Epitaph, then
their ill report while you liued

   Pol. My Lord, I will vse them according to their desart

   Ham. Gods bodykins man, better. Vse euerie man
after his desart, and who should scape whipping: vse
them after your own Honor and Dignity. The lesse they
deserue, the more merit is in your bountie. Take them
in

   Pol. Come sirs.

Exit Polon.

  Ham. Follow him Friends: wee'l heare a play to morrow.
Dost thou heare me old Friend, can you play the
murther of Gonzago?
  Play. I my Lord

   Ham. Wee'l ha't to morrow night. You could for a
need study a speech of some dosen or sixteene lines, which
I would set downe, and insert in't? Could ye not?
  Play. I my Lord

   Ham. Very well. Follow that Lord, and looke you
mock him not. My good Friends, Ile leaue you til night
you are welcome to Elsonower?
  Rosin. Good my Lord.

Exeunt.

Manet Hamlet.

  Ham. I so, God buy'ye: Now I am alone.
Oh what a Rogue and Pesant slaue am I?
Is it not monstrous that this Player heere,
But in a Fixion, in a dreame of Passion,
Could force his soule so to his whole conceit,
That from her working, all his visage warm'd;
Teares in his eyes, distraction in's Aspect,
A broken voyce, and his whole Function suiting
With Formes, to his Conceit? And all for nothing?
For Hecuba?
What's Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba,
That he should weepe for her? What would he doe,
Had he the Motiue and the Cue for passion
That I haue? He would drowne the Stage with teares,
And cleaue the generall eare with horrid speech:
Make mad the guilty, and apale the free,
Confound the ignorant, and amaze indeed,
The very faculty of Eyes and Eares. Yet I,
A dull and muddy-metled Rascall, peake
Like Iohn a-dreames, vnpregnant of my cause,
And can say nothing: No, not for a King,
Vpon whose property, and most deere life,
A damn'd defeate was made. Am I a Coward?
Who calles me Villaine? breakes my pate a-crosse?
Pluckes off my Beard, and blowes it in my face?
Tweakes me by'th' Nose? giues me the Lye i'th' Throate,
As deepe as to the Lungs? Who does me this?
Ha? Why I should take it: for it cannot be,
But I am Pigeon-Liuer'd, and lacke Gall
To make Oppression bitter, or ere this,
I should haue fatted all the Region Kites
With this Slaues Offall, bloudy: a Bawdy villaine,
Remorselesse, Treacherous, Letcherous, kindles villaine!
Oh Vengeance!
Who? What an Asse am I? I sure, this is most braue,
That I, the Sonne of the Deere murthered,
Prompted to my Reuenge by Heauen, and Hell,
Must (like a Whore) vnpacke my heart with words,
And fall a Cursing like a very Drab.
A Scullion? Fye vpon't: Foh. About my Braine.
I haue heard, that guilty Creatures sitting at a Play,
Haue by the very cunning of the Scoene,
Bene strooke so to the soule, that presently
They haue proclaim'd their Malefactions.
For Murther, though it haue no tongue, will speake
With most myraculous Organ. Ile haue these Players,
Play something like the murder of my Father,
Before mine Vnkle. Ile obserue his lookes,
Ile rent him to the quicke: If he but blench
I know my course. The Spirit that I haue seene
May be the Diuell, and the Diuel hath power
T' assume a pleasing shape, yea and perhaps
Out of my Weaknesse, and my Melancholly,
As he is very potent with such Spirits,
Abuses me to damne me. Ile haue grounds
More Relatiue then this: The Play's the thing,
Wherein Ile catch the Conscience of the King.

Exit

Enter King, Queene, Polonius, Ophelia, Rosincrance,
Guildenstern, and
Lords.

  King. And can you by no drift of circumstance
Get from him why he puts on this Confusion:
Grating so harshly all his dayes of quiet
With turbulent and dangerous Lunacy

   Rosin. He does confesse he feeles himselfe distracted,
But from what cause he will by no meanes speake

   Guil. Nor do we finde him forward to be sounded,
But with a crafty Madnesse keepes aloofe:
When we would bring him on to some Confession
Of his true state

   Qu. Did he receiue you well?
  Rosin. Most like a Gentleman

   Guild. But with much forcing of his disposition

   Rosin. Niggard of question, but of our demands
Most free in his reply

   Qu. Did you assay him to any pastime?
  Rosin. Madam, it so fell out, that certaine Players
We ore-wrought on the way: of these we told him,
And there did seeme in him a kinde of ioy
To heare of it: They are about the Court,
And (as I thinke) they haue already order
This night to play before him

   Pol. 'Tis most true:
And he beseech'd me to intreate your Maiesties
To heare, and see the matter

   King. With all my heart, and it doth much content me
To heare him so inclin'd. Good Gentlemen,
Giue him a further edge, and driue his purpose on
To these delights

   Rosin. We shall my Lord.

Exeunt.

  King. Sweet Gertrude leaue vs too,
For we haue closely sent for Hamlet hither,
That he, as 'twere by accident, may there
Affront Ophelia. Her Father, and my selfe (lawful espials)
Will so bestow our selues, that seeing vnseene
We may of their encounter frankely iudge,
And gather by him, as he is behaued,
If't be th' affliction of his loue, or no.
That thus he suffers for

   Qu. I shall obey you,
And for your part Ophelia, I do wish
That your good Beauties be the happy cause
Of Hamlets wildenesse: so shall I hope your Vertues
Will bring him to his wonted way againe,
To both your Honors

   Ophe. Madam, I wish it may

   Pol. Ophelia, walke you heere. Gracious so please ye
We will bestow our selues: Reade on this booke,
That shew of such an exercise may colour
Your lonelinesse. We are oft too blame in this,
'Tis too much prou'd, that with Deuotions visage,
And pious Action, we do surge o're
The diuell himselfe

   King. Oh 'tis true:
How smart a lash that speech doth giue my Conscience?
The Harlots Cheeke beautied with plaist'ring Art
Is not more vgly to the thing that helpes it,
Then is my deede, to my most painted word.
Oh heauie burthen!
  Pol. I heare him comming, let's withdraw my Lord.

Exeunt.

Enter Hamlet.

  Ham. To be, or not to be, that is the Question:
Whether 'tis Nobler in the minde to suffer
The Slings and Arrowes of outragious Fortune,
Or to take Armes against a Sea of troubles,
And by opposing end them: to dye, to sleepe
No more; and by a sleepe, to say we end
The Heart-ake, and the thousand Naturall shockes
That Flesh is heyre too? 'Tis a consummation
Deuoutly to be wish'd. To dye to sleepe,
To sleepe, perchance to Dreame; I, there's the rub,
For in that sleepe of death, what dreames may come,
When we haue shuffel'd off this mortall coile,
Must giue vs pawse. There's the respect
That makes Calamity of so long life:
For who would beare the Whips and Scornes of time,
The Oppressors wrong, the poore mans Contumely,
The pangs of dispriz'd Loue, the Lawes delay,
The insolence of Office, and the Spurnes
That patient merit of the vnworthy takes,
When he himselfe might his Quietus make
With a bare Bodkin? Who would these Fardles beare
To grunt and sweat vnder a weary life,
But that the dread of something after death,
The vndiscouered Countrey, from whose Borne
No Traueller returnes, Puzels the will,
And makes vs rather beare those illes we haue,
Then flye to others that we know not of.
Thus Conscience does make Cowards of vs all,
And thus the Natiue hew of Resolution
Is sicklied o're, with the pale cast of Thought,
And enterprizes of great pith and moment,
With this regard their Currants turne away,
And loose the name of Action. Soft you now,
The faire Ophelia? Nimph, in thy Orizons
Be all my sinnes remembred

   Ophe. Good my Lord,
How does your Honor for this many a day?
  Ham. I humbly thanke you: well, well, well

   Ophe. My Lord, I haue Remembrances of yours,
That I haue longed long to re-deliuer.
I pray you now, receiue them

   Ham. No, no, I neuer gaue you ought

   Ophe. My honor'd Lord, I know right well you did,
And with them words of so sweet breath compos'd,
As made the things more rich, then perfume left:
Take these againe, for to the Noble minde
Rich gifts wax poore, when giuers proue vnkinde.
There my Lord

   Ham. Ha, ha: Are you honest?
  Ophe. My Lord

   Ham. Are you faire?
  Ophe. What meanes your Lordship?
  Ham. That if you be honest and faire, your Honesty
should admit no discourse to your Beautie

   Ophe. Could Beautie my Lord, haue better Comerce
then your Honestie?
  Ham. I trulie: for the power of Beautie, will sooner
transforme Honestie from what is, to a Bawd, then the
force of Honestie can translate Beautie into his likenesse.
This was sometime a Paradox, but now the time giues it
proofe. I did loue you once

   Ophe. Indeed my Lord, you made me beleeue so

   Ham. You should not haue beleeued me. For vertue
cannot so innocculate our old stocke, but we shall rellish
of it. I loued you not

   Ophe. I was the more deceiued

   Ham. Get thee to a Nunnerie. Why would'st thou
be a breeder of Sinners? I am my selfe indifferent honest,
but yet I could accuse me of such things, that it were better
my Mother had not borne me. I am very prowd, reuengefull,
Ambitious, with more offences at my becke,
then I haue thoughts to put them in imagination, to giue
them shape, or time to acte them in. What should such
Fellowes as I do, crawling betweene Heauen and Earth.
We are arrant Knaues all, beleeue none of vs. Goe thy
wayes to a Nunnery. Where's your Father?
  Ophe. At home, my Lord

   Ham. Let the doores be shut vpon him, that he may
play the Foole no way, but in's owne house. Farewell

   Ophe. O helpe him, you sweet Heauens

   Ham. If thou doest Marry, Ile giue thee this Plague
for thy Dowrie. Be thou as chast as Ice, as pure as Snow,
thou shalt not escape Calumny. Get thee to a Nunnery.
Go, Farewell. Or if thou wilt needs Marry, marry a fool:
for Wise men know well enough, what monsters you
make of them. To a Nunnery go, and quickly too. Farwell

   Ophe. O heauenly Powers, restore him

   Ham. I haue heard of your pratlings too wel enough.
God has giuen you one pace, and you make your selfe another:
you gidge, you amble, and you lispe, and nickname
Gods creatures, and make your Wantonnesse, your Ignorance.
Go too, Ile no more on't, it hath made me mad.
I say, we will haue no more Marriages. Those that are
married already, all but one shall liue, the rest shall keep
as they are. To a Nunnery, go.

Exit Hamlet.

  Ophe. O what a Noble minde is heere o're-throwne?
The Courtiers, Soldiers, Schollers: Eye, tongue, sword,
Th' expectansie and Rose of the faire State,
The glasse of Fashion, and the mould of Forme,
Th' obseru'd of all Obseruers, quite, quite downe.
Haue I of Ladies most deiect and wretched,
That suck'd the Honie of his Musicke Vowes:
Now see that Noble, and most Soueraigne Reason,
Like sweet Bels iangled out of tune, and harsh,
That vnmatch'd Forme and Feature of blowne youth,
Blasted with extasie. Oh woe is me,
T'haue seene what I haue seene: see what I see.
Enter King, and Polonius.

  King. Loue? His affections do not that way tend,
Nor what he spake, though it lack'd Forme a little,
Was not like Madnesse. There's something in his soule?
O're which his Melancholly sits on brood,
And I do doubt the hatch, and the disclose
Will be some danger, which to preuent
I haue in quicke determination
Thus set it downe. He shall with speed to England
For the demand of our neglected Tribute:
Haply the Seas and Countries different
With variable Obiects, shall expell
This something setled matter in his heart:
Whereon his Braines still beating, puts him thus
From fashion of himselfe. What thinke you on't?
  Pol. It shall do well. But yet do I beleeue
The Origin and Commencement of this greefe
Sprung from neglected loue. How now Ophelia?
You neede not tell vs, what Lord Hamlet saide,
We heard it all. My Lord, do as you please,
But if you hold it fit after the Play,
Let his Queene Mother all alone intreat him
To shew his Greefes: let her be round with him,
And Ile be plac'd so, please you in the eare
Of all their Conference. If she finde him not,
To England send him: Or confine him where
Your wisedome best shall thinke

   King. It shall be so:
Madnesse in great Ones, must not vnwatch'd go.

Exeunt.

Enter Hamlet, and two or three of the Players.

  Ham. Speake the Speech I pray you, as I pronounc'd
it to you trippingly on the Tongue: But if you mouth it,
as many of your Players do, I had as liue the Town-Cryer
had spoke my Lines: Nor do not saw the Ayre too much
your hand thus, but vse all gently; for in the verie Torrent,
Tempest, and (as I say) the Whirle-winde of
Passion, you must acquire and beget a Temperance that
may giue it Smoothnesse. O it offends mee to the Soule,
to see a robustious Pery-wig-pated Fellow, teare a Passion
to tatters, to verie ragges, to split the eares of the
Groundlings: who (for the most part) are capeable of
nothing, but inexplicable dumbe shewes, & noise: I could
haue such a Fellow whipt for o're-doing Termagant: it
outHerod's Herod. Pray you auoid it

   Player. I warrant your Honor

   Ham. Be not too tame neyther: but let your owne
Discretion be your Tutor. Sute the Action to the Word,
the Word to the Action, with this speciall obseruance:
That you ore-stop not the modestie of Nature; for any
thing so ouer-done, is fro[m] the purpose of Playing, whose
end both at the first and now, was and is, to hold as 'twer
the Mirrour vp to Nature; to shew Vertue her owne
Feature, Scorne her owne Image, and the verie Age and
Bodie of the Time, his forme and pressure. Now, this
ouer-done, or come tardie off, though it make the vnskilfull
laugh, cannot but make the Iudicious greeue; The
censure of the which One, must in your allowance o'reway
a whole Theater of Others. Oh, there bee Players
that I haue seene Play, and heard others praise, and that
highly (not to speake it prophanely) that neyther hauing
the accent of Christians, nor the gate of Christian, Pagan,
or Norman, haue so strutted and bellowed, that I haue
thought some of Natures Iouerney-men had made men,
and not made them well, they imitated Humanity so abhominably

   Play. I hope we haue reform'd that indifferently with
vs, Sir

   Ham. O reforme it altogether. And let those that
play your Clownes, speake no more then is set downe for
them. For there be of them, that will themselues laugh,
to set on some quantitie of barren Spectators to laugh
too, though in the meane time, some necessary Question
of the Play be then to be considered: that's Villanous, &
shewes a most pittifull Ambition in the Foole that vses
it. Go make you readie.

Exit Players.

Enter Polonius, Rosincrance, and Guildensterne.

How now my Lord,
Will the King heare this peece of Worke?
  Pol. And the Queene too, and that presently

   Ham. Bid the Players make hast.

Exit Polonius.

Will you two helpe to hasten them?
  Both. We will my Lord.

Exeunt.

Enter Horatio.

  Ham. What hoa, Horatio?
  Hora. Heere sweet Lord, at your Seruice

   Ham. Horatio, thou art eene as iust a man
As ere my Conuersation coap'd withall

   Hora. O my deere Lord

   Ham. Nay, do not thinke I flatter:
For what aduancement may I hope from thee,
That no Reuennew hast, but thy good spirits
To feed & cloath thee. Why shold the poor be flatter'd?
No, let the Candied tongue, like absurd pompe,
And crooke the pregnant Hindges of the knee,
Where thrift may follow faining? Dost thou heare,
Since my deere Soule was Mistris of my choyse,
And could of men distinguish, her election
Hath seal'd thee for her selfe. For thou hast bene
As one in suffering all, that suffers nothing.
A man that Fortunes buffets, and Rewards
Hath 'tane with equall Thankes. And blest are those,
Whose Blood and Iudgement are so well co-mingled,
That they are not a Pipe for Fortunes finger.
To sound what stop she please. Giue me that man,
That is not Passions Slaue, and I will weare him
In my hearts Core. I, in my Heart of heart,
As I do thee. Something too much of this.
There is a Play to night to before the King.
One Scoene of it comes neere the Circumstance
Which I haue told thee, of my Fathers death.
I prythee, when thou see'st that Acte a-foot,
Euen with the verie Comment of my Soule
Obserue mine Vnkle: If his occulted guilt,
Do not it selfe vnkennell in one speech,
It is a damned Ghost that we haue seene:
And my Imaginations are as foule
As Vulcans Stythe. Giue him needfull note,
For I mine eyes will riuet to his Face:
And after we will both our iudgements ioyne,
To censure of his seeming

   Hora. Well my Lord.
If he steale ought the whil'st this Play is Playing,
And scape detecting, I will pay the Theft.
Enter King, Queene, Polonius, Ophelia, Rosincrance,
Guildensterne, and
other Lords attendant with his Guard carrying Torches. Danish
March. Sound
a Flourish.

  Ham. They are comming to the Play: I must be idle.
Get you a place

   King. How fares our Cosin Hamlet?
  Ham. Excellent Ifaith, of the Camelions dish: I eate
the Ayre promise-cramm'd, you cannot feed Capons so

   King. I haue nothing with this answer Hamlet, these
words are not mine

   Ham. No, nor mine. Now my Lord, you plaid once
i'th' Vniuersity, you say?
  Polon. That I did my Lord, and was accounted a good
Actor

   Ham. And what did you enact?
  Pol. I did enact Iulius Caesar, I was kill'd i'th' Capitol:
Brutus kill'd me

   Ham. It was a bruite part of him, to kill so Capitall a
Calfe there. Be the Players ready?
  Rosin. I my Lord, they stay vpon your patience

   Qu. Come hither my good Hamlet, sit by me

   Ha. No good Mother, here's Mettle more attractiue

   Pol. Oh ho, do you marke that?
  Ham. Ladie, shall I lye in your Lap?
  Ophe. No my Lord

   Ham. I meane, my Head vpon your Lap?
  Ophe. I my Lord

   Ham. Do you thinke I meant Country matters?
  Ophe. I thinke nothing, my Lord

   Ham. That's a faire thought to ly betweene Maids legs
  Ophe. What is my Lord?
  Ham. Nothing

   Ophe. You are merrie, my Lord?
  Ham. Who I?
  Ophe. I my Lord

   Ham. Oh God, your onely Iigge-maker: what should
a man do, but be merrie. For looke you how cheerefully
my Mother lookes, and my Father dyed within's two
Houres

   Ophe. Nay, 'tis twice two moneths, my Lord

   Ham. So long? Nay then let the Diuel weare blacke,
for Ile haue a suite of Sables. Oh Heauens! dye two moneths
ago, and not forgotten yet? Then there's hope, a
great mans Memorie, may out-liue his life halfe a yeare:
But byrlady he must builde Churches then: or else shall
he suffer not thinking on, with the Hoby-horsse, whose
Epitaph is, For o, For o, the Hoby-horse is forgot.

Hoboyes play. The dumbe shew enters.

Enter a King and Queene, very louingly; the Queene embracing
him. She
kneeles, and makes shew of Protestation vnto him. He takes her
vp, and
declines his head vpon her neck. Layes him downe vpon a Banke
of Flowers.
She seeing him a-sleepe, leaues him. Anon comes in a Fellow,
takes off his
Crowne, kisses it, and powres poyson in the Kings eares, and
Exits. The
Queene returnes, findes the King dead, and makes passionate
Action. The
Poysoner, with some two or three Mutes comes in againe, seeming
to lament
with her. The dead body is carried away: The Poysoner Wooes the
Queene with
Gifts, she seemes loath and vnwilling awhile, but in the end,
accepts his
loue.

Exeunt.

  Ophe. What meanes this, my Lord?
  Ham. Marry this is Miching Malicho, that meanes
Mischeefe

   Ophe. Belike this shew imports the Argument of the
Play?
  Ham. We shall know by these Fellowes: the Players
cannot keepe counsell, they'l tell all

   Ophe. Will they tell vs what this shew meant?
  Ham. I, or any shew that you'l shew him. Bee not
you asham'd to shew, hee'l not shame to tell you what it
meanes

   Ophe. You are naught, you are naught, Ile marke the
Play.
Enter Prologue.

For vs, and for our Tragedie,
Heere stooping to your Clemencie:
We begge your hearing Patientlie

   Ham. Is this a Prologue, or the Poesie of a Ring?
  Ophe. 'Tis briefe my Lord

   Ham. As Womans loue.
Enter King and his Queene.

  King. Full thirtie times hath Phoebus Cart gon round,
Neptunes salt Wash, and Tellus Orbed ground:
And thirtie dozen Moones with borrowed sheene,
About the World haue times twelue thirties beene,
Since loue our hearts, and Hymen did our hands
Vnite comutuall, in most sacred Bands

   Bap. So many iournies may the Sunne and Moone
Make vs againe count o're, ere loue be done.
But woe is me, you are so sicke of late,
So farre from cheere, and from your former state,
That I distrust you: yet though I distrust,
Discomfort you (my Lord) it nothing must:
For womens Feare and Loue, holds quantitie,
In neither ought, or in extremity:
Now what my loue is, proofe hath made you know,
And as my Loue is siz'd, my Feare is so

   King. Faith I must leaue thee Loue, and shortly too:
My operant Powers my Functions leaue to do:
And thou shalt liue in this faire world behinde,
Honour'd, belou'd, and haply, one as kinde.
For Husband shalt thou-
  Bap. Oh confound the rest:
Such Loue, must needs be Treason in my brest:
In second Husband, let me be accurst,
None wed the second, but who kill'd the first

   Ham. Wormwood, Wormwood

   Bapt. The instances that second Marriage moue,
Are base respects of Thrift, but none of Loue.
A second time, I kill my Husband dead,
When second Husband kisses me in Bed

   King. I do beleeue you. Think what now you speak:
But what we do determine, oft we breake:
Purpose is but the slaue to Memorie,
Of violent Birth, but poore validitie:
Which now like Fruite vnripe stickes on the Tree,
But fall vnshaken, when they mellow bee.
Most necessary 'tis, that we forget
To pay our selues, what to our selues is debt:
What to our selues in passion we propose,
The passion ending, doth the purpose lose.
The violence of other Greefe or Ioy,
Their owne ennactors with themselues destroy:
Where Ioy most Reuels, Greefe doth most lament;
Greefe ioyes, Ioy greeues on slender accident.
This world is not for aye, nor 'tis not strange
That euen our Loues should with our Fortunes change.
For 'tis a question left vs yet to proue,
Whether Loue lead Fortune, or else Fortune Loue.
The great man downe, you marke his fauourites flies,
The poore aduanc'd, makes Friends of Enemies:
And hitherto doth Loue on Fortune tend,
For who not needs, shall neuer lacke a Frend:
And who in want a hollow Friend doth try,
Directly seasons him his Enemie.
But orderly to end, where I begun,
Our Willes and Fates do so contrary run,
That our Deuices still are ouerthrowne,
Our thoughts are ours, their ends none of our owne.
So thinke thou wilt no second Husband wed.
But die thy thoughts, when thy first Lord is dead

   Bap. Nor Earth to giue me food, nor Heauen light,
Sport and repose locke from me day and night:
Each opposite that blankes the face of ioy,
Meet what I would haue well, and it destroy:
Both heere, and hence, pursue me lasting strife,
If once a Widdow, euer I be Wife

   Ham. If she should breake it now

   King. 'Tis deepely sworne:
Sweet, leaue me heere a while,
My spirits grow dull, and faine I would beguile
The tedious day with sleepe

   Qu. Sleepe rocke thy Braine,

Sleepes

And neuer come mischance betweene vs twaine.

Exit

  Ham. Madam, how like you this Play?
  Qu. The Lady protests to much me thinkes

   Ham. Oh but shee'l keepe her word

   King. Haue you heard the Argument, is there no Offence
in't?
  Ham. No, no, they do but iest, poyson in iest, no Offence
i'th' world

   King. What do you call the Play?
  Ham. The Mouse-trap: Marry how? Tropically:
This Play is the Image of a murder done in Vienna: Gonzago
is the Dukes name, his wife Baptista: you shall see
anon: 'tis a knauish peece of worke: But what o'that?
Your Maiestie, and wee that haue free soules, it touches
vs not: let the gall'd iade winch: our withers are vnrung.
Enter Lucianus.

This is one Lucianus nephew to the King

   Ophe. You are a good Chorus, my Lord

   Ham. I could interpret betweene you and your loue:
if I could see the Puppets dallying

   Ophe. You are keene my Lord, you are keene

   Ham. It would cost you a groaning, to take off my
edge

   Ophe. Still better and worse

   Ham. So you mistake Husbands.
Begin Murderer. Pox, leaue thy damnable Faces, and
begin. Come, the croaking Rauen doth bellow for Reuenge

   Lucian. Thoughts blacke, hands apt,
Drugges fit, and Time agreeing:
Confederate season, else, no Creature seeing:
Thou mixture ranke, of Midnight Weeds collected,
With Hecats Ban, thrice blasted, thrice infected,
Thy naturall Magicke, and dire propertie,
On wholsome life, vsurpe immediately.

Powres the poyson in his eares.

  Ham. He poysons him i'th' Garden for's estate: His
name's Gonzago: the Story is extant and writ in choyce
Italian. You shall see anon how the Murtherer gets the
loue of Gonzago's wife

   Ophe. The King rises

   Ham. What, frighted with false fire

   Qu. How fares my Lord?
  Pol. Giue o're the Play

   King. Giue me some Light. Away

   All. Lights, Lights, Lights.

Exeunt.

Manet Hamlet & Horatio.

  Ham. Why let the strucken Deere go weepe,
The Hart vngalled play:
For some must watch, while some must sleepe;
So runnes the world away.
Would not this Sir, and a Forrest of Feathers, if the rest of
my Fortunes turne Turke with me; with two Prouinciall
Roses on my rac'd Shooes, get me a Fellowship in a crie
of Players sir

   Hor. Halfe a share

   Ham. A whole one I,
For thou dost know: Oh Damon deere,
This Realme dismantled was of Ioue himselfe,
And now reignes heere.
A verie verie Paiocke

   Hora. You might haue Rim'd

   Ham. Oh good Horatio, Ile take the Ghosts word for
a thousand pound. Did'st perceiue?
  Hora. Verie well my Lord

   Ham. Vpon the talke of the poysoning?
  Hora. I did verie well note him.
Enter Rosincrance and Guildensterne.

  Ham. Oh, ha? Come some Musick. Come y Recorders:
For if the King like not the Comedie,
Why then belike he likes it not perdie.
Come some Musicke

   Guild. Good my Lord, vouchsafe me a word with you

   Ham. Sir, a whole History

   Guild. The King, sir

   Ham. I sir, what of him?
  Guild. Is in his retyrement, maruellous distemper'd

   Ham. With drinke Sir?
  Guild. No my Lord, rather with choller

   Ham. Your wisedome should shew it selfe more richer,
to signifie this to his Doctor: for for me to put him
to his Purgation, would perhaps plundge him into farre
more Choller

   Guild. Good my Lord put your discourse into some
frame, and start not so wildely from my affayre

   Ham. I am tame Sir, pronounce

   Guild. The Queene your Mother, in most great affliction
of spirit, hath sent me to you

   Ham. You are welcome

   Guild. Nay, good my Lord, this courtesie is not of
the right breed. If it shall please you to make me a wholsome
answer, I will doe your Mothers command'ment:
if not, your pardon, and my returne shall bee the end of
my Businesse

   Ham. Sir, I cannot

   Guild. What, my Lord?
  Ham. Make you a wholsome answere: my wits diseas'd.
But sir, such answers as I can make, you shal command:
or rather you say, my Mother: therfore no more
but to the matter. My Mother you say

   Rosin. Then thus she sayes: your behauior hath stroke
her into amazement, and admiration

   Ham. Oh wonderfull Sonne, that can so astonish a
Mother. But is there no sequell at the heeles of this Mothers
admiration?
  Rosin. She desires to speake with you in her Closset,
ere you go to bed

   Ham. We shall obey, were she ten times our Mother.
Haue you any further Trade with vs?
  Rosin. My Lord, you once did loue me

   Ham. So I do still, by these pickers and stealers

   Rosin. Good my Lord, what is your cause of distemper?
You do freely barre the doore of your owne Libertie,
if you deny your greefes to your Friend

   Ham. Sir I lacke Aduancement

   Rosin. How can that be, when you haue the voyce of
the King himselfe, for your Succession in Denmarke?
  Ham. I, but while the grasse growes, the Prouerbe is
something musty.
Enter one with a Recorder.

O the Recorder. Let me see, to withdraw with you, why
do you go about to recouer the winde of mee, as if you
would driue me into a toyle?
  Guild. O my Lord, if my Dutie be too bold, my loue
is too vnmannerly

   Ham. I do not well vnderstand that. Will you play
vpon this Pipe?
  Guild. My Lord, I cannot

   Ham. I pray you

   Guild. Beleeue me, I cannot

   Ham. I do beseech you

   Guild. I know no touch of it, my Lord

   Ham. 'Tis as easie as lying: gouerne these Ventiges
with your finger and thumbe, giue it breath with your
mouth, and it will discourse most excellent Musicke.
Looke you, these are the stoppes

   Guild. But these cannot I command to any vtterance
of hermony, I haue not the skill

   Ham. Why looke you now, how vnworthy a thing
you make of me: you would play vpon mee; you would
seeme to know my stops: you would pluck out the heart
of my Mysterie; you would sound mee from my lowest
Note, to the top of my Compasse: and there is much Musicke,
excellent Voice, in this little Organe, yet cannot
you make it. Why do you thinke, that I am easier to bee
plaid on, then a Pipe? Call me what Instrument you will,
though you can fret me, you cannot play vpon me. God
blesse you Sir.
Enter Polonius.

  Polon. My Lord; the Queene would speak with you,
and presently

   Ham. Do you see that Clowd? that's almost in shape
like a Camell

   Polon. By'th' Masse, and it's like a Camell indeed

   Ham. Me thinkes it is like a Weazell

   Polon. It is back'd like a Weazell

   Ham. Or like a Whale?
  Polon. Verie like a Whale

   Ham. Then will I come to my Mother, by and by:
They foole me to the top of my bent.
I will come by and by

   Polon. I will say so.
Enter.

  Ham. By and by, is easily said. Leaue me Friends:
'Tis now the verie witching time of night,
When Churchyards yawne, and Hell it selfe breaths out
Contagion to this world. Now could I drink hot blood,
And do such bitter businesse as the day
Would quake to looke on. Soft now, to my Mother:
Oh Heart, loose not thy Nature; let not euer
The Soule of Nero, enter this firme bosome:
Let me be cruell, not vnnaturall,
I will speake Daggers to her, but vse none:
My Tongue and Soule in this be Hypocrites.
How in my words someuer she be shent,
To giue them Seales, neuer my Soule consent.
Enter King, Rosincrance, and Guildensterne.

  King. I like him not, nor stands it safe with vs,
To let his madnesse range. Therefore prepare you,
I your Commission will forthwith dispatch,
And he to England shall along with you:
The termes of our estate, may not endure
Hazard so dangerous as doth hourely grow
Out of his Lunacies

   Guild. We will our selues prouide:
Most holie and Religious feare it is
To keepe those many many bodies safe
That liue and feede vpon your Maiestie

   Rosin. The single
And peculiar life is bound
With all the strength and Armour of the minde,
To keepe it selfe from noyance: but much more,
That Spirit, vpon whose spirit depends and rests
The liues of many, the cease of Maiestie
Dies not alone; but like a Gulfe doth draw
What's neere it, with it. It is a massie wheele
Fixt on the Somnet of the highest Mount.
To whose huge Spoakes, ten thousand lesser things
Are mortiz'd and adioyn'd: which when it falles,
Each small annexment, pettie consequence
Attends the boystrous Ruine. Neuer alone
Did the King sighe, but with a generall grone

   King. Arme you, I pray you to this speedie Voyage;
For we will Fetters put vpon this feare,
Which now goes too free-footed

   Both. We will haste vs.

Exeunt. Gent.

Enter Polonius.

  Pol. My Lord, he's going to his Mothers Closset:
Behinde the Arras Ile conuey my selfe
To heare the Processe. Ile warrant shee'l tax him home,
And as you said, and wisely was it said,
'Tis meete that some more audience then a Mother,
Since Nature makes them partiall, should o're-heare
The speech of vantage. Fare you well my Liege,
Ile call vpon you ere you go to bed,
And tell you what I know

   King. Thankes deere my Lord.
Oh my offence is ranke, it smels to heauen,
It hath the primall eldest curse vpon't,
A Brothers murther. Pray can I not,
Though inclination be as sharpe as will:
My stronger guilt, defeats my strong intent,
And like a man to double businesse bound,
I stand in pause where I shall first begin,
And both neglect; what if this cursed hand
Were thicker then it selfe with Brothers blood,
Is there not Raine enough in the sweet Heauens
To wash it white as Snow? Whereto serues mercy,
But to confront the visage of Offence?
And what's in Prayer, but this two-fold force,
To be fore-stalled ere we come to fall,
Or pardon'd being downe? Then Ile looke vp,
My fault is past. But oh, what forme of Prayer
Can serue my turne? Forgiue me my foule Murther:
That cannot be, since I am still possest
Of those effects for which I did the Murther.
My Crowne, mine owne Ambition, and my Queene:
May one be pardon'd, and retaine th' offence?
In the corrupted currants of this world,
Offences gilded hand may shoue by Iustice,
And oft 'tis seene, the wicked prize it selfe
Buyes out the Law; but 'tis not so aboue,
There is no shuffling, there the Action lyes
In his true Nature, and we our selues compell'd
Euen to the teeth and forehead of our faults,
To giue in euidence. What then? What rests?
Try what Repentance can. What can it not?
Yet what can it, when one cannot repent?
Oh wretched state! Oh bosome, blacke as death!
Oh limed soule, that strugling to be free,
Art more ingag'd: Helpe Angels, make assay:
Bow stubborne knees, and heart with strings of Steele,
Be soft as sinewes of the new-borne Babe,
All may be well.
Enter Hamlet.

  Ham. Now might I do it pat, now he is praying,
And now Ile doo't, and so he goes to Heauen,
And so am I reueng'd: that would be scann'd,
A Villaine killes my Father, and for that
I his foule Sonne, do this same Villaine send
To heauen. Oh this is hyre and Sallery, not Reuenge.
He tooke my Father grossely, full of bread,
With all his Crimes broad blowne, as fresh as May,
And how his Audit stands, who knowes, saue Heauen:
But in our circumstance and course of thought
'Tis heauie with him: and am I then reueng'd,
To take him in the purging of his Soule,
When he is fit and season'd for his passage? No.
Vp Sword, and know thou a more horrid hent
When he is drunke asleepe: or in his Rage,
Or in th' incestuous pleasure of his bed,
At gaming, swearing, or about some acte
That ha's no rellish of Saluation in't,
Then trip him, that his heeles may kicke at Heauen,
And that his Soule may be as damn'd and blacke
As Hell, whereto it goes. My Mother stayes,
This Physicke but prolongs thy sickly dayes.
Enter.

  King. My words flye vp, my thoughts remain below,
Words without thoughts, neuer to Heauen go.
Enter.

Enter Queene and Polonius.

  Pol. He will come straight:
Looke you lay home to him,
Tell him his prankes haue been too broad to beare with,
And that your Grace hath screen'd, and stoode betweene
Much heate, and him. Ile silence me e'ene heere:
Pray you be round with him

   Ham. within. Mother, mother, mother

   Qu. Ile warrant you, feare me not.
Withdraw, I heare him coming.
Enter Hamlet.

  Ham. Now Mother, what's the matter?
  Qu. Hamlet, thou hast thy Father much offended


   Ham. Mother, you haue my Father much offended

   Qu. Come, come, you answer with an idle tongue

   Ham. Go, go, you question with an idle tongue

   Qu. Why how now Hamlet?
  Ham. Whats the matter now?
  Qu. Haue you forgot me?
  Ham. No by the Rood, not so:
You are the Queene, your Husbands Brothers wife,
But would you were not so. You are my Mother

   Qu. Nay, then Ile set those to you that can speake

   Ham. Come, come, and sit you downe, you shall not
boudge:
You go not till I set you vp a glasse,
Where you may see the inmost part of you?
  Qu. What wilt thou do? thou wilt not murther me?
Helpe, helpe, hoa

   Pol. What hoa, helpe, helpe, helpe

   Ham. How now, a Rat? dead for a Ducate, dead

   Pol. Oh I am slaine.

Killes Polonius

   Qu. Oh me, what hast thou done?
  Ham. Nay I know not, is it the King?
  Qu. Oh what a rash, and bloody deed is this?
  Ham. A bloody deed, almost as bad good Mother,
As kill a King, and marrie with his Brother

   Qu. As kill a King?
  Ham. I Lady, 'twas my word.
Thou wretched, rash, intruding foole farewell,
I tooke thee for thy Betters, take thy Fortune,
Thou find'st to be too busie, is some danger.
Leaue wringing of your hands, peace, sit you downe,
And let me wring your heart, for so I shall
If it be made of penetrable stuffe;
If damned Custome haue not braz'd it so,
That it is proofe and bulwarke against Sense

   Qu. What haue I done, that thou dar'st wag thy tong,
In noise so rude against me?
  Ham. Such an Act
That blurres the grace and blush of Modestie,
Cals Vertue Hypocrite, takes off the Rose
From the faire forehead of an innocent loue,
And makes a blister there. Makes marriage vowes
As false as Dicers Oathes. Oh such a deed,
As from the body of Contraction pluckes
The very soule, and sweete Religion makes
A rapsidie of words. Heauens face doth glow,
Yea this solidity and compound masse,
With tristfull visage as against the doome,
Is thought-sicke at the act

   Qu. Aye me; what act, that roares so lowd, & thunders
in the Index

   Ham. Looke heere vpon this Picture, and on this,
The counterfet presentment of two Brothers:
See what a grace was seated on his Brow,
Hyperions curles, the front of Ioue himselfe,
An eye like Mars, to threaten or command
A Station, like the Herald Mercurie
New lighted on a heauen-kissing hill:
A Combination, and a forme indeed,
Where euery God did seeme to set his Seale,
To giue the world assurance of a man.
This was your Husband. Looke you now what followes.
Heere is your Husband, like a Mildew'd eare
Blasting his wholsom breath. Haue you eyes?
Could you on this faire Mountaine leaue to feed,
And batten on this Moore? Ha? Haue you eyes?
You cannot call it Loue: For at your age,
The hey-day in the blood is tame, it's humble,
And waites vpon the Iudgement: and what Iudgement
Would step from this, to this? What diuell was't,
That thus hath cousend you at hoodman-blinde?
O Shame! where is thy Blush? Rebellious Hell,
If thou canst mutine in a Matrons bones,
To flaming youth, let Vertue be as waxe.
And melt in her owne fire. Proclaime no shame,
When the compulsiue Ardure giues the charge,
Since Frost it selfe, as actiuely doth burne,
As Reason panders Will

   Qu. O Hamlet, speake no more.
Thou turn'st mine eyes into my very soule,
And there I see such blacke and grained spots,
As will not leaue their Tinct

   Ham. Nay, but to liue
In the ranke sweat of an enseamed bed,
Stew'd in Corruption; honying and making loue
Ouer the nasty Stye

   Qu. Oh speake to me, no more,
These words like Daggers enter in mine eares.
No more sweet Hamlet

   Ham. A Murderer, and a Villaine:
A Slaue, that is not twentieth part the tythe
Of your precedent Lord. A vice of Kings,
A Cutpurse of the Empire and the Rule.
That from a shelfe, the precious Diadem stole,
And put it in his Pocket

   Qu. No more.
Enter Ghost.

  Ham. A King of shreds and patches.
Saue me; and houer o're me with your wings
You heauenly Guards. What would your gracious figure?
  Qu. Alas he's mad

   Ham. Do you not come your tardy Sonne to chide,
That laps't in Time and Passion, lets go by
Th' important acting of your dread command? Oh say

   Ghost. Do not forget: this Visitation
Is but to whet thy almost blunted purpose.
But looke, Amazement on thy Mother sits;
O step betweene her, and her fighting Soule,
Conceit in weakest bodies, strongest workes.
Speake to her Hamlet

   Ham. How is it with you Lady?
  Qu. Alas, how is't with you?
That you bend your eye on vacancie,
And with their corporall ayre do hold discourse.
Forth at your eyes, your spirits wildely peepe,
And as the sleeping Soldiours in th' Alarme,
Your bedded haire, like life in excrements,
Start vp, and stand an end. Oh gentle Sonne,
Vpon the heate and flame of thy distemper
Sprinkle coole patience. Whereon do you looke?
  Ham. On him, on him: look you how pale he glares,
His forme and cause conioyn'd, preaching to stones,
Would make them capeable. Do not looke vpon me,
Least with this pitteous action you conuert
My sterne effects: then what I haue to do,
Will want true colour; teares perchance for blood

   Qu. To who do you speake this?
  Ham. Do you see nothing there?
  Qu. Nothing at all, yet all that is I see

   Ham. Nor did you nothing heare?
  Qu. No, nothing but our selues

   Ham. Why look you there: looke how it steals away:
My Father in his habite, as he liued,
Looke where he goes euen now out at the Portall.
Enter.

  Qu. This is the very coynage of your Braine,
This bodilesse Creation extasie is very cunning in

   Ham. Extasie?
My Pulse as yours doth temperately keepe time,
And makes as healthfull Musicke. It is not madnesse
That I haue vttered; bring me to the Test
And I the matter will re-word: which madnesse
Would gamboll from. Mother, for loue of Grace,
Lay not a flattering Vnction to your soule,
That not your trespasse, but my madnesse speakes:
It will but skin and filme the Vlcerous place,
Whil'st ranke Corruption mining all within,
Infects vnseene. Confesse your selfe to Heauen,
Repent what's past, auoyd what is to come,
And do not spred the Compost on the Weedes,
To make them ranke. Forgiue me this my Vertue,
For in the fatnesse of this pursie times,
Vertue it selfe, of Vice must pardon begge,
Yea courb, and woe, for leaue to do him good

   Qu. Oh Hamlet,
Thou hast cleft my heart in twaine

   Ham. O throw away the worser part of it,
And liue the purer with the other halfe.
Good night, but go not to mine Vnkles bed,
Assume a Vertue, if you haue it not, refraine to night,
And that shall lend a kinde of easinesse
To the next abstinence. Once more goodnight,
And when you are desirous to be blest,
Ile blessing begge of you. For this same Lord,
I do repent: but heauen hath pleas'd it so,
To punish me with this, and this with me,
That I must be their Scourge and Minister.
I will bestow him, and will answer well
The death I gaue him: so againe, good night.
I must be cruell, onely to be kinde;
Thus bad begins and worse remaines behinde

   Qu. What shall I do?
  Ham. Not this by no meanes that I bid you do:
Let the blunt King tempt you againe to bed,
Pinch Wanton on your cheeke, call you his Mouse,
And let him for a paire of reechie kisses,
Or padling in your necke with his damn'd Fingers,
Make you to rauell all this matter out,
That I essentially am not in madnesse,
But made in craft. 'Twere good you let him know,
For who that's but a Queene, faire, sober, wise,
Would from a Paddocke, from a Bat, a Gibbe,
Such deere concernings hide, Who would do so,
No in despight of Sense and Secrecie,
Vnpegge the Basket on the houses top:
Let the Birds flye, and like the famous Ape
To try Conclusions in the Basket, creepe
And breake your owne necke downe

   Qu. Be thou assur'd, if words be made of breath,
And breath of life: I haue no life to breath
What thou hast saide to me

   Ham. I must to England, you know that?
  Qu. Alacke I had forgot: 'Tis so concluded on

   Ham. This man shall set me packing:
Ile lugge the Guts into the Neighbor roome,
Mother goodnight. Indeede this Counsellor
Is now most still, most secret, and most graue,
Who was in life, a foolish prating Knaue.
Come sir, to draw toward an end with you.
Good night Mother.
Exit Hamlet tugging in Polonius.

Enter King.

  King. There's matters in these sighes.
These profound heaues
You must translate; Tis fit we vnderstand them.
Where is your Sonne?
  Qu. Ah my good Lord, what haue I seene to night?
  King. What Gertrude? How do's Hamlet?
  Qu. Mad as the Seas, and winde, when both contend
Which is the Mightier, in his lawlesse fit
Behinde the Arras, hearing something stirre,
He whips his Rapier out, and cries a Rat, a Rat,
And in his brainish apprehension killes
The vnseene good old man

   King. Oh heauy deed:
It had bin so with vs had we beene there:
His Liberty is full of threats to all,
To you your selfe, to vs, to euery one.
Alas, how shall this bloody deede be answered?
It will be laide to vs, whose prouidence
Should haue kept short, restrain'd, and out of haunt,
This mad yong man. But so much was our loue,
We would not vnderstand what was most fit,
But like the Owner of a foule disease,
To keepe it from divulging, let's it feede
Euen on the pith of life. Where is he gone?
  Qu. To draw apart the body he hath kild,
O're whom his very madnesse like some Oare
Among a Minerall of Mettels base
Shewes it selfe pure. He weepes for what is done

   King. Oh Gertrude, come away:
The Sun no sooner shall the Mountaines touch,
But we will ship him hence, and this vilde deed,
We must with all our Maiesty and Skill
Both countenance, and excuse.
Enter Ros. & Guild.

Ho Guildenstern:
Friends both go ioyne you with some further ayde:
Hamlet in madnesse hath Polonius slaine,
And from his Mother Clossets hath he drag'd him.
Go seeke him out, speake faire, and bring the body
Into the Chappell. I pray you hast in this.
Exit Gent.

Come Gertrude, wee'l call vp our wisest friends,
To let them know both what we meane to do,
And what's vntimely done. Oh come away,
My soule is full of discord and dismay.

Exeunt.

Enter Hamlet.

  Ham. Safely stowed

   Gentlemen within. Hamlet, Lord Hamlet

   Ham. What noise? Who cals on Hamlet?
Oh heere they come.
Enter Ros. and Guildensterne.

  Ro. What haue you done my Lord with the dead body?
  Ham. Compounded it with dust, whereto 'tis Kinne

   Rosin. Tell vs where 'tis, that we may take it thence,
And beare it to the Chappell

   Ham. Do not beleeue it

   Rosin. Beleeue what?
  Ham. That I can keepe your counsell, and not mine
owne. Besides, to be demanded of a Spundge, what replication
should be made by the Sonne of a King

   Rosin. Take you me for a Spundge, my Lord?
  Ham. I sir, that sokes vp the Kings Countenance, his
Rewards, his Authorities (but such Officers do the King
best seruice in the end. He keepes them like an Ape in
the corner of his iaw, first mouth'd to be last swallowed,
when he needes what you haue glean'd, it is but squeezing
you, and Spundge you shall be dry againe

   Rosin. I vnderstand you not my Lord

   Ham. I am glad of it: a knauish speech sleepes in a
foolish eare

   Rosin. My Lord, you must tell vs where the body is,
and go with vs to the King

   Ham. The body is with the King, but the King is not
with the body. The King, is a thing-
  Guild. A thing my Lord?
  Ham. Of nothing: bring me to him, hide Fox, and all
after.

Exeunt.

Enter King.

  King. I haue sent to seeke him, and to find the bodie:
How dangerous is it that this man goes loose:
Yet must not we put the strong Law on him:
Hee's loued of the distracted multitude,
Who like not in their iudgement, but their eyes:
And where 'tis so, th' Offenders scourge is weigh'd
But neerer the offence: to beare all smooth, and euen,
This sodaine sending him away, must seeme
Deliberate pause, diseases desperate growne,
By desperate appliance are releeued,
Or not at all.
Enter Rosincrane.

How now? What hath befalne?
  Rosin. Where the dead body is bestow'd my Lord,
We cannot get from him

   King. But where is he?
  Rosin. Without my Lord, guarded to know your
pleasure

   King. Bring him before vs

   Rosin. Hoa, Guildensterne? Bring in my Lord.
Enter Hamlet and Guildensterne.

  King. Now Hamlet, where's Polonius?
  Ham. At Supper

   King. At Supper? Where?
  Ham. Not where he eats, but where he is eaten, a certaine
conuocation of wormes are e'ne at him. Your worm
is your onely Emperor for diet. We fat all creatures else
to fat vs, and we fat our selfe for Magots. Your fat King,
and your leane Begger is but variable seruice to dishes,
but to one Table that's the end

   King. What dost thou meane by this?
  Ham. Nothing but to shew you how a King may go
a Progresse through the guts of a Begger

   King. Where is Polonius

   Ham. In heauen, send thither to see. If your Messenger
finde him not there, seeke him i'th other place your
selfe: but indeed, if you finde him not this moneth, you
shall nose him as you go vp the staires into the Lobby

   King. Go seeke him there

   Ham. He will stay till ye come

   K. Hamlet, this deed of thine, for thine especial safety
Which we do tender, as we deerely greeue
For that which thou hast done, must send thee hence
With fierie Quicknesse. Therefore prepare thy selfe,
The Barke is readie, and the winde at helpe,
Th' Associates tend, and euery thing at bent
For England

   Ham. For England?
  King. I Hamlet

   Ham. Good

   King. So is it, if thou knew'st our purposes

   Ham. I see a Cherube that see's him: but come, for
England. Farewell deere Mother

   King. Thy louing Father Hamlet

   Hamlet. My Mother: Father and Mother is man and
wife: man & wife is one flesh, and so my mother. Come,
for England.

Exit

  King. Follow him at foote,
Tempt him with speed aboord:
Delay it not, Ile haue him hence to night.
Away, for euery thing is Seal'd and done
That else leanes on th' Affaire, pray you make hast.
And England, if my loue thou holdst at ought,
As my great power thereof may giue thee sense,
Since yet thy Cicatrice lookes raw and red
After the Danish Sword, and thy free awe
Payes homage to vs; thou maist not coldly set
Our Soueraigne Processe, which imports at full
By Letters coniuring to that effect
The present death of Hamlet. Do it England,
For like the Hecticke in my blood he rages,
And thou must cure me: Till I know 'tis done,
How ere my happes, my ioyes were ne're begun.

Exit

Enter Fortinbras with an Armie.

  For. Go Captaine, from me greet the Danish King,
Tell him that by his license, Fortinbras
Claimes the conueyance of a promis'd March
Ouer his Kingdome. You know the Rendeuous:
If that his Maiesty would ought with vs,
We shall expresse our dutie in his eye,
And let him know so

   Cap. I will doo't, my Lord

   For. Go safely on.
Enter.

Enter Queene and Horatio.

  Qu. I will not speake with her

   Hor. She is importunate, indeed distract, her moode
will needs be pittied

   Qu. What would she haue?
  Hor. She speakes much of her Father; saies she heares
There's trickes i'th' world, and hems, and beats her heart,
Spurnes enuiously at Strawes, speakes things in doubt,
That carry but halfe sense: Her speech is nothing,
Yet the vnshaped vse of it doth moue
The hearers to Collection; they ayme at it,
And botch the words vp fit to their owne thoughts,
Which as her winkes, and nods, and gestures yeeld them,
Indeed would make one thinke there would be thought,
Though nothing sure, yet much vnhappily

   Qu. 'Twere good she were spoken with,
For she may strew dangerous coniectures
In ill breeding minds. Let her come in.
To my sicke soule (as sinnes true Nature is)
Each toy seemes Prologue, to some great amisse,
So full of Artlesse iealousie is guilt,
It spill's it selfe, in fearing to be spilt.
Enter Ophelia distracted.

  Ophe. Where is the beauteous Maiesty of Denmark

   Qu. How now Ophelia?
  Ophe. How should I your true loue know from another one?
By his Cockle hat and staffe, and his Sandal shoone

   Qu. Alas sweet Lady: what imports this Song?
  Ophe. Say you? Nay pray you marke.
He is dead and gone Lady, he is dead and gone,
At his head a grasse-greene Turfe, at his heeles a stone.
Enter King.

  Qu. Nay but Ophelia

   Ophe. Pray you marke.
White his Shrow'd as the Mountaine Snow

   Qu. Alas, looke heere my Lord

   Ophe. Larded with sweet Flowers:
Which bewept to the graue did not go,
With true-loue showres

   King. How do ye, pretty Lady?
  Ophe. Well, God dil'd you. They say the Owle was
a Bakers daughter. Lord, wee know what we are, but
know not what we may be. God be at your Table

   King. Conceit vpon her Father

   Ophe. Pray you let's haue no words of this: but when
they aske you what it meanes, say you this:
To morrow is S[aint]. Valentines day, all in the morning betime,
And I a Maid at your Window, to be your Valentine.
Then vp he rose, & don'd his clothes, & dupt the chamber dore,
Let in the Maid, that out a Maid, neuer departed more

   King. Pretty Ophelia

   Ophe. Indeed la? without an oath Ile make an end ont.
By gis, and by S[aint]. Charity,
Alacke, and fie for shame:
Yong men wil doo't, if they come too't,
By Cocke they are too blame.
Quoth she before you tumbled me,
You promis'd me to Wed:
So would I ha done by yonder Sunne,
And thou hadst not come to my bed

   King. How long hath she bin thus?
  Ophe. I hope all will be well. We must bee patient,
but I cannot choose but weepe, to thinke they should
lay him i'th' cold ground: My brother shall knowe of it,
and so I thanke you for your good counsell. Come, my
Coach: Goodnight Ladies: Goodnight sweet Ladies:
Goodnight, goodnight.
Enter.

  King. Follow her close,
Giue her good watch I pray you:
Oh this is the poyson of deepe greefe, it springs
All from her Fathers death. Oh Gertrude, Gertrude,
When sorrowes comes, they come not single spies,
But in Battalians. First, her Father slaine,
Next your Sonne gone, and he most violent Author
Of his owne iust remoue: the people muddied,
Thicke and vnwholsome in their thoughts, and whispers
For good Polonius death; and we haue done but greenly
In hugger mugger to interre him. Poore Ophelia
Diuided from her selfe, and her faire Iudgement,
Without the which we are Pictures, or meere Beasts.
Last, and as much containing as all these,
Her Brother is in secret come from France,
Keepes on his wonder, keepes himselfe in clouds,
And wants not Buzzers to infect his eare
With pestilent Speeches of his Fathers death,
Where in necessitie of matter Beggard,
Will nothing sticke our persons to Arraigne
In eare and eare. O my deere Gertrude, this,
Like to a murdering Peece in many places,
Giues me superfluous death.

A Noise within.

Enter a Messenger.

  Qu. Alacke, what noyse is this?
  King. Where are my Switzers?
Let them guard the doore. What is the matter?
  Mes. Saue your selfe, my Lord.
The Ocean (ouer-peering of his List)
Eates not the Flats with more impittious haste
Then young Laertes, in a Riotous head,
Ore-beares your Officers, the rabble call him Lord,
And as the world were now but to begin,
Antiquity forgot, Custome not knowne,
The Ratifiers and props of euery word,
They cry choose we? Laertes shall be King,
Caps, hands, and tongues, applaud it to the clouds,
Laertes shall be King, Laertes King

   Qu. How cheerefully on the false Traile they cry,
Oh this is Counter you false Danish Dogges.

Noise within. Enter Laertes.

  King. The doores are broke

   Laer. Where is the King, sirs? Stand you all without

   All. No, let's come in

   Laer. I pray you giue me leaue

   Al. We will, we will

   Laer. I thanke you: Keepe the doore.
Oh thou vilde King, giue me my Father

   Qu. Calmely good Laertes

   Laer. That drop of blood, that calmes
Proclaimes me Bastard:
Cries Cuckold to my Father, brands the Harlot
Euen heere betweene the chaste vnsmirched brow
Of my true Mother

   King. What is the cause Laertes,
That thy Rebellion lookes so Gyant-like?
Let him go Gertrude: Do not feare our person:
There's such Diuinity doth hedge a King,
That Treason can but peepe to what it would,
Acts little of his will. Tell me Laertes,
Why thou art thus Incenst? Let him go Gertrude.
Speake man

   Laer. Where's my Father?
  King. Dead

   Qu. But not by him

   King. Let him demand his fill

   Laer. How came he dead? Ile not be Iuggel'd with.
To hell Allegeance: Vowes, to the blackest diuell.
Conscience and Grace, to the profoundest Pit.
I dare Damnation: to this point I stand,
That both the worlds I giue to negligence,
Let come what comes: onely Ile be reueng'd
Most throughly for my Father

   King. Who shall stay you?
  Laer. My Will, not all the world,
And for my meanes, Ile husband them so well,
They shall go farre with little

   King. Good Laertes:
If you desire to know the certaintie
Of your deere Fathers death, if writ in your reuenge,
That Soop-stake you will draw both Friend and Foe,
Winner and Looser

   Laer. None but his Enemies

   King. Will you know them then

   La. To his good Friends, thus wide Ile ope my Armes:
And like the kinde Life-rend'ring Politician,
Repast them with my blood

   King. Why now you speake
Like a good Childe, and a true Gentleman.
That I am guiltlesse of your Fathers death,
And am most sensible in greefe for it,
It shall as leuell to your Iudgement pierce
As day do's to your eye.

A noise within. Let her come in.

Enter Ophelia.

  Laer. How now? what noise is that?
Oh heate drie vp my Braines, teares seuen times salt,
Burne out the Sence and Vertue of mine eye.
By Heauen, thy madnesse shall be payed by waight,
Till our Scale turnes the beame. Oh Rose of May,
Deere Maid, kinde Sister, sweet Ophelia:
Oh Heauens, is't possible, a yong Maids wits,
Should be as mortall as an old mans life?
Nature is fine in Loue, and where 'tis fine,
It sends some precious instance of it selfe
After the thing it loues

   Ophe. They bore him bare fac'd on the Beer,
Hey non nony, nony, hey nony:
And on his graue raines many a teare,
Fare you well my Doue

   Laer. Had'st thou thy wits, and did'st perswade Reuenge,
it could not moue thus

   Ophe. You must sing downe a-downe, and you call
him a-downe-a. Oh, how the wheele becomes it? It is
the false Steward that stole his masters daughter

   Laer. This nothings more then matter

   Ophe. There's Rosemary, that's for Remembraunce.
Pray loue remember: and there is Paconcies, that's for
Thoughts

   Laer. A document in madnesse, thoughts & remembrance
fitted

   Ophe. There's Fennell for you, and Columbines: ther's
Rew for you, and heere's some for me. Wee may call it
Herbe-Grace a Sundaies: Oh you must weare your Rew
with a difference. There's a Daysie, I would giue you
some Violets, but they wither'd all when my Father dyed:
They say, he made a good end;
For bonny sweet Robin is all my ioy

   Laer. Thought, and Affliction, Passion, Hell it selfe:
She turnes to Fauour, and to prettinesse

   Ophe. And will he not come againe,
And will he not come againe:
No, no, he is dead, go to thy Death-bed,
He neuer wil come againe.
His Beard as white as Snow,
All Flaxen was his Pole:
He is gone, he is gone, and we cast away mone,
Gramercy on his Soule.
And of all Christian Soules, I pray God.
God buy ye.

Exeunt. Ophelia

  Laer. Do you see this, you Gods?
  King. Laertes, I must common with your greefe,
Or you deny me right: go but apart,
Make choice of whom your wisest Friends you will,
And they shall heare and iudge 'twixt you and me;
If by direct or by Colaterall hand
They finde vs touch'd, we will our Kingdome giue,
Our Crowne, our Life, and all that we call Ours
To you in satisfaction. But if not,
Be you content to lend your patience to vs,
And we shall ioyntly labour with your soule
To giue it due content

   Laer. Let this be so:
His meanes of death, his obscure buriall;
No Trophee, Sword, nor Hatchment o're his bones,
No Noble rite, nor formall ostentation,
Cry to be heard, as 'twere from Heauen to Earth,
That I must call in question

   King. So you shall:
And where th' offence is, let the great Axe fall.
I pray you go with me.

Exeunt.

Enter Horatio, with an Attendant.

  Hora. What are they that would speake with me?
  Ser. Saylors sir, they say they haue Letters for you

   Hor. Let them come in,
I do not know from what part of the world
I should be greeted, if not from Lord Hamlet.
Enter Saylor.

  Say. God blesse you Sir

   Hor. Let him blesse thee too

   Say. Hee shall Sir, and't please him. There's a Letter
for you Sir: It comes from th' Ambassadours that was
bound for England, if your name be Horatio, as I am let
to know it is.

Reads the Letter.

Horatio, When thou shalt haue ouerlook'd this, giue these
Fellowes some meanes to the King: They haue Letters
for him. Ere we were two dayes old at Sea, a Pyrate of very
Warlicke appointment gaue vs Chace. Finding our selues too
slow of Saile, we put on a compelled Valour. In the Grapple, I
boorded them: On the instant they got cleare of our Shippe, so
I alone became their Prisoner. They haue dealt with mee, like
Theeues of Mercy, but they knew what they did. I am to doe
a good turne for them. Let the King haue the Letters I haue
sent, and repaire thou to me with as much hast as thou wouldest
flye death. I haue words to speake in your eare, will make thee
dumbe, yet are they much too light for the bore of the Matter.
These good Fellowes will bring thee where I am. Rosincrance
and Guildensterne, hold their course for England. Of them
I haue much to tell thee, Farewell.
He that thou knowest thine,
Hamlet.
Come, I will giue you way for these your Letters,
And do't the speedier, that you may direct me
To him from whom you brought them.
Enter.

Enter King and Laertes.

  King. Now must your conscience my acquittance seal,
And you must put me in your heart for Friend,
Sith you haue heard, and with a knowing eare,
That he which hath your Noble Father slaine,
Pursued my life

   Laer. It well appeares. But tell me,
Why you proceeded not against these feates,
So crimefull, and so Capitall in Nature,
As by your Safety, Wisedome, all things else,
You mainly were stirr'd vp?
  King. O for two speciall Reasons,
Which may to you (perhaps) seeme much vnsinnowed,
And yet to me they are strong. The Queen his Mother,
Liues almost by his lookes: and for my selfe,
My Vertue or my Plague, be it either which,
She's so coniunctiue to my life, and soule;
That as the Starre moues not but in his Sphere,
I could not but by her. The other Motiue,
Why to a publike count I might not go,
Is the great loue the generall gender beare him,
Who dipping all his Faults in their affection,
Would like the Spring that turneth Wood to Stone,
Conuert his Gyues to Graces. So that my Arrowes
Too slightly timbred for so loud a Winde,
Would haue reuerted to my Bow againe,
And not where I had arm'd them

   Laer. And so haue I a Noble Father lost,
A Sister driuen into desperate tearmes,
Who was (if praises may go backe againe)
Stood Challenger on mount of all the Age
For her perfections. But my reuenge will come

   King. Breake not your sleepes for that,
You must not thinke
That we are made of stuffe, so flat, and dull,
That we can let our Beard be shooke with danger,
And thinke it pastime. You shortly shall heare more,
I lou'd your Father, and we loue our Selfe,
And that I hope will teach you to imagine-
Enter a Messenger.

How now? What Newes?
  Mes. Letters my Lord from Hamlet, This to your
Maiesty: this to the Queene

   King. From Hamlet? Who brought them?
  Mes. Saylors my Lord they say, I saw them not:
They were giuen me by Claudio, he receiu'd them

   King. Laertes you shall heare them:
Leaue vs.

Exit Messenger

High and Mighty, you shall know I am set naked on your
Kingdome. To morrow shall I begge leaue to see your Kingly
Eyes. When I shall (first asking your Pardon thereunto) recount
th' Occasions of my sodaine, and more strange returne.
Hamlet.
What should this meane? Are all the rest come backe?
Or is it some abuse? Or no such thing?
  Laer. Know you the hand?
  Kin. 'Tis Hamlets Character, naked and in a Postscript
here he sayes alone: Can you aduise me?
  Laer. I'm lost in it my Lord; but let him come,
It warmes the very sicknesse in my heart,
That I shall liue and tell him to his teeth;
Thus diddest thou

   Kin. If it be so Laertes, as how should it be so:
How otherwise will you be rul'd by me?
  Laer. If so you'l not o'rerule me to a peace

   Kin. To thine owne peace: if he be now return'd,
As checking at his Voyage, and that he meanes
No more to vndertake it; I will worke him
To an exployt now ripe in my Deuice,
Vnder the which he shall not choose but fall;
And for his death no winde of blame shall breath,
But euen his Mother shall vncharge the practice,
And call it accident: Some two Monthes hence
Here was a Gentleman of Normandy,
I'ue seene my selfe, and seru'd against the French,
And they ran well on Horsebacke; but this Gallant
Had witchcraft in't; he grew into his Seat,
And to such wondrous doing brought his Horse,
As had he beene encorps't and demy-Natur'd
With the braue Beast, so farre he past my thought,
That I in forgery of shapes and trickes,
Come short of what he did

   Laer. A Norman was't?
  Kin. A Norman

   Laer. Vpon my life Lamound

   Kin. The very same

   Laer. I know him well, he is the Brooch indeed,
And Iemme of all our Nation

   Kin. Hee mad confession of you,
And gaue you such a Masterly report,
For Art and exercise in your defence;
And for your Rapier most especiall,
That he cryed out, t'would be a sight indeed,
If one could match you Sir. This report of his
Did Hamlet so envenom with his Enuy,
That he could nothing doe but wish and begge,
Your sodaine comming ore to play with him;
Now out of this

   Laer. Why out of this, my Lord?
  Kin. Laertes was your Father deare to you?
Or are you like the painting of a sorrow,
A face without a heart?
  Laer. Why aske you this?
  Kin. Not that I thinke you did not loue your Father,
But that I know Loue is begun by Time:
And that I see in passages of proofe,
Time qualifies the sparke and fire of it:
Hamlet comes backe: what would you vndertake,
To show your selfe your Fathers sonne indeed,
More then in words?
  Laer. To cut his throat i'th' Church

   Kin. No place indeed should murder Sancturize;
Reuenge should haue no bounds: but good Laertes
Will you doe this, keepe close within your Chamber,
Hamlet return'd, shall know you are come home:
Wee'l put on those shall praise your excellence,
And set a double varnish on the fame
The Frenchman gaue you, bring you in fine together,
And wager on your heads, he being remisse,
Most generous, and free from all contriuing,
Will not peruse the Foiles? So that with ease,
Or with a little shuffling, you may choose
A Sword vnbaited, and in a passe of practice,
Requit him for your Father

   Laer. I will doo't.
And for that purpose Ile annoint my Sword:
I bought an Vnction of a Mountebanke
So mortall, I but dipt a knife in it,
Where it drawes blood, no Cataplasme so rare,
Collected from all Simples that haue Vertue
Vnder the Moone, can saue the thing from death,
That is but scratcht withall: Ile touch my point,
With this contagion, that if I gall him slightly,
It may be death

   Kin. Let's further thinke of this,
Weigh what conuenience both of time and meanes
May fit vs to our shape, if this should faile;
And that our drift looke through our bad performance,
'Twere better not assaid; therefore this Proiect
Should haue a backe or second, that might hold,
If this should blast in proofe: Soft, let me see
Wee'l make a solemne wager on your commings,
I ha't: when in your motion you are hot and dry,
As make your bowts more violent to the end,
And that he cals for drinke; Ile haue prepar'd him
A Challice for the nonce; whereon but sipping,
If he by chance escape your venom'd stuck,
Our purpose may hold there; how sweet Queene.
Enter Queene.

  Queen. One woe doth tread vpon anothers heele,
So fast they'l follow: your Sister's drown'd Laertes

   Laer. Drown'd! O where?
  Queen. There is a Willow growes aslant a Brooke,
That shewes his hore leaues in the glassie streame:
There with fantasticke Garlands did she come,
Of Crow-flowers, Nettles, Daysies, and long Purples,
That liberall Shepheards giue a grosser name;
But our cold Maids doe Dead Mens Fingers call them:
There on the pendant boughes, her Coronet weeds
Clambring to hang; an enuious sliuer broke,
When downe the weedy Trophies, and her selfe,
Fell in the weeping Brooke, her cloathes spred wide,
And Mermaid-like, a while they bore her vp,
Which time she chaunted snatches of old tunes,
As one incapable of her owne distresse,
Or like a creature Natiue, and indued
Vnto that Element: but long it could not be,
Till that her garments, heauy with her drinke,
Pul'd the poore wretch from her melodious buy,
To muddy death

   Laer. Alas then, is she drown'd?
  Queen. Drown'd, drown'd

   Laer. Too much of water hast thou poore Ophelia,
And therefore I forbid my teares: but yet
It is our tricke, Nature her custome holds,
Let shame say what it will; when these are gone
The woman will be out: Adue my Lord,
I haue a speech of fire, that faine would blaze,
But that this folly doubts it.
Enter.

  Kin. Let's follow, Gertrude:
How much I had to doe to calme his rage?
Now feare I this will giue it start againe;
Therefore let's follow.

Exeunt.

Enter two Clownes.

  Clown. Is she to bee buried in Christian buriall, that
wilfully seekes her owne saluation?
  Other. I tell thee she is, and therefore make her Graue
straight, the Crowner hath sate on her, and finds it Christian
buriall

   Clo. How can that be, vnlesse she drowned her selfe in
her owne defence?
  Other. Why 'tis found so

   Clo. It must be Se offendendo, it cannot bee else: for
heere lies the point; If I drowne my selfe wittingly, it argues
an Act: and an Act hath three branches. It is an
Act to doe and to performe; argall she drown'd her selfe
wittingly

   Other. Nay but heare you Goodman Deluer

   Clown. Giue me leaue; heere lies the water; good:
heere stands the man; good: If the man goe to this water
and drowne himselfe; it is will he nill he, he goes;
marke you that? But if the water come to him & drowne
him; hee drownes not himselfe. Argall, hee that is not
guilty of his owne death, shortens not his owne life

   Other. But is this law?
  Clo. I marry is't, Crowners Quest Law

   Other. Will you ha the truth on't: if this had not
beene a Gentlewoman, shee should haue beene buried
out of Christian Buriall

   Clo. Why there thou say'st. And the more pitty that
great folke should haue countenance in this world to
drowne or hang themselues, more then their euen Christian.
Come, my Spade; there is no ancient Gentlemen,
but Gardiners, Ditchers and Graue-makers; they hold vp
Adams Profession

   Other. Was he a Gentleman?
  Clo. He was the first that euer bore Armes

   Other. Why he had none

   Clo. What, ar't a Heathen? how doth thou vnderstand
the Scripture? the Scripture sayes Adam dig'd;
could hee digge without Armes? Ile put another question
to thee; if thou answerest me not to the purpose, confesse
thy selfe-
  Other. Go too

   Clo. What is he that builds stronger then either the
Mason, the Shipwright, or the Carpenter?
  Other. The Gallowes maker; for that Frame outliues a
thousand Tenants

   Clo. I like thy wit well in good faith, the Gallowes
does well; but how does it well? it does well to those
that doe ill: now, thou dost ill to say the Gallowes is
built stronger then the Church: Argall, the Gallowes
may doe well to thee. Too't againe, Come

   Other. Who builds stronger then a Mason, a Shipwright,
or a Carpenter?
  Clo. I, tell me that, and vnyoake

   Other. Marry, now I can tell

   Clo. Too't

   Other. Masse, I cannot tell.
Enter Hamlet and Horatio a farre off.

  Clo. Cudgell thy braines no more about it; for your
dull Asse will not mend his pace with beating; and when
you are ask't this question next, say a Graue-maker: the
Houses that he makes, lasts till Doomesday: go, get thee
to Yaughan, fetch me a stoupe of Liquor.

Sings.

In youth when I did loue, did loue,
me thought it was very sweete:
To contract O the time for a my behoue,
O me thought there was nothing meete

   Ham. Ha's this fellow no feeling of his businesse, that
he sings at Graue-making?
  Hor. Custome hath made it in him a property of easinesse

   Ham. 'Tis ee'n so; the hand of little Imployment hath
the daintier sense

   Clowne sings. But Age with his stealing steps
hath caught me in his clutch:
And hath shipped me intill the Land,
as if I had neuer beene such

   Ham. That Scull had a tongue in it, and could sing
once: how the knaue iowles it to th' grownd, as if it
were Caines Iaw-bone, that did the first murther: It
might be the Pate of a Polititian which this Asse o're Offices:
one that could circumuent God, might it not?
  Hor. It might, my Lord

   Ham. Or of a Courtier, which could say, Good Morrow
sweet Lord: how dost thou, good Lord? this
might be my Lord such a one, that prais'd my Lord such
a ones Horse, when he meant to begge it; might it not?
  Hor. I, my Lord

   Ham. Why ee'n so: and now my Lady Wormes,
Chaplesse, and knockt about the Mazard with a Sextons
Spade; heere's fine Reuolution, if wee had the tricke to
see't. Did these bones cost no more the breeding, but
to play at Loggets with 'em? mine ake to thinke
on't

   Clowne sings. A Pickhaxe and a Spade, a Spade,
for and a shrowding-Sheete:
O a Pit of Clay for to be made,
for such a Guest is meete

   Ham. There's another: why might not that bee the
Scull of a Lawyer? where be his Quiddits now? his
Quillets? his Cases? his Tenures, and his Tricks? why
doe's he suffer this rude knaue now to knocke him about
the Sconce with a dirty Shouell, and will not tell him of
his Action of Battery? hum. This fellow might be in's
time a great buyer of Land, with his Statutes, his Recognizances,
his Fines, his double Vouchers, his Recoueries:
Is this the fine of his Fines, and the recouery of his Recoueries,
to haue his fine Pate full of fine Dirt? will his
Vouchers vouch him no more of his Purchases, and double
ones too, then the length and breadth of a paire of
Indentures? the very Conueyances of his Lands will
hardly lye in this Boxe; and must the Inheritor himselfe
haue no more? ha?
  Hor. Not a iot more, my Lord

   Ham. Is not Parchment made of Sheep-skinnes?
  Hor. I my Lord, and of Calue-skinnes too

   Ham. They are Sheepe and Calues that seek out assurance
in that. I will speake to this fellow: whose Graue's
this Sir?
  Clo. Mine Sir:
O a Pit of Clay for to be made,
for such a Guest is meete

   Ham. I thinke it be thine indeed: for thou liest in't

   Clo. You lye out on't Sir, and therefore it is not yours:
for my part, I doe not lye in't; and yet it is mine

   Ham. Thou dost lye in't, to be in't and say 'tis thine:
'tis for the dead, not for the quicke, therefore thou
lyest

   Clo. 'Tis a quicke lye Sir, 'twill away againe from me
to you

   Ham. What man dost thou digge it for?
  Clo. For no man Sir

   Ham. What woman then?
  Clo. For none neither

   Ham. Who is to be buried in't?
  Clo. One that was a woman Sir; but rest her Soule,
shee's dead

   Ham. How absolute the knaue is? wee must speake
by the Carde, or equiuocation will vndoe vs: by the
Lord Horatio, these three yeares I haue taken note of it,
the Age is growne so picked, that the toe of the Pesant
comes so neere the heeles of our Courtier, hee galls his
Kibe. How long hast thou been a Graue-maker?
  Clo. Of all the dayes i'th' yeare, I came too't that day
that our last King Hamlet o'recame Fortinbras

   Ham. How long is that since?
  Clo. Cannot you tell that? euery foole can tell that:
It was the very day, that young Hamlet was borne, hee
that was mad, and sent into England

   Ham. I marry, why was he sent into England?
  Clo. Why, because he was mad; hee shall recouer his
wits there; or if he do not, it's no great matter there

   Ham. Why?
  Clo. 'Twill not be seene in him, there the men are as
mad as he

   Ham. How came he mad?
  Clo. Very strangely they say

   Ham. How strangely?
  Clo. Faith e'ene with loosing his wits

   Ham. Vpon what ground?
  Clo. Why heere in Denmarke: I haue bin sixeteene
heere, man and Boy thirty yeares

   Ham. How long will a man lie i'th' earth ere he rot?
  Clo. Ifaith, if he be not rotten before he die (as we haue
many pocky Coarses now adaies, that will scarce hold
the laying in) he will last you some eight yeare, or nine
yeare. A Tanner will last you nine yeare

   Ham. Why he, more then another?
  Clo. Why sir, his hide is so tan'd with his Trade, that
he will keepe out water a great while. And your water,
is a sore Decayer of your horson dead body. Heres a Scull
now: this Scul, has laine in the earth three & twenty years

   Ham. Whose was it?
  Clo. A whoreson mad Fellowes it was;
Whose doe you thinke it was?
  Ham. Nay, I know not

   Clo. A pestilence on him for a mad Rogue, a pour'd a
Flaggon of Renish on my head once. This same Scull
Sir, this same Scull sir, was Yoricks Scull, the Kings Iester

   Ham. This?
  Clo. E'ene that

   Ham. Let me see. Alas poore Yorick, I knew him Horatio,
a fellow of infinite Iest; of most excellent fancy, he
hath borne me on his backe a thousand times: And how
abhorred my Imagination is, my gorge rises at it. Heere
hung those lipps, that I haue kist I know not how oft.
Where be your Iibes now? Your Gambals? Your
Songs? Your flashes of Merriment that were wont to
set the Table on a Rore? No one now to mock your own
Ieering? Quite chopfalne? Now get you to my Ladies
Chamber, and tell her, let her paint an inch thicke, to this
fauour she must come. Make her laugh at that: prythee
Horatio tell me one thing

   Hor. What's that my Lord?
  Ham. Dost thou thinke Alexander lookt o'this fashion
i'th' earth?
  Hor. E'ene so

   Ham. And smelt so? Puh

   Hor. E'ene so, my Lord

   Ham. To what base vses we may returne Horatio.
Why may not Imagination trace the Noble dust of Alexander,
till he find it stopping a bunghole

   Hor. 'Twere to consider: to curiously to consider so

   Ham. No faith, not a iot. But to follow him thether
with modestie enough, & likeliehood to lead it; as thus.
Alexander died: Alexander was buried: Alexander returneth
into dust; the dust is earth; of earth we make
Lome, and why of that Lome (whereto he was conuerted)
might they not stopp a Beere-barrell?
Imperiall Caesar, dead and turn'd to clay,
Might stop a hole to keepe the winde away.
Oh, that that earth, which kept the world in awe,
Should patch a Wall, t' expell the winters flaw.
But soft, but soft, aside; heere comes the King.
Enter King, Queene, Laertes, and a Coffin, with Lords attendant.

The Queene, the Courtiers. Who is that they follow,
And with such maimed rites? This doth betoken,
The Coarse they follow, did with disperate hand,
Fore do it owne life; 'twas some Estate.
Couch we a while, and mark

   Laer. What Cerimony else?
  Ham. That is Laertes, a very Noble youth: Marke

   Laer. What Cerimony else?
  Priest. Her Obsequies haue bin as farre inlarg'd.
As we haue warrantie, her death was doubtfull,
And but that great Command, o're-swaies the order,
She should in ground vnsanctified haue lodg'd,
Till the last Trumpet. For charitable praier,
Shardes, Flints, and Peebles, should be throwne on her:
Yet heere she is allowed her Virgin Rites,
Her Maiden strewments, and the bringing home
Of Bell and Buriall

   Laer. Must there no more be done ?
  Priest. No more be done:
We should prophane the seruice of the dead,
To sing sage Requiem, and such rest to her
As to peace-parted Soules

   Laer. Lay her i'th' earth,
And from her faire and vnpolluted flesh,
May Violets spring. I tell thee (churlish Priest)
A Ministring Angell shall my Sister be,
When thou liest howling?
  Ham. What, the faire Ophelia?
  Queene. Sweets, to the sweet farewell.
I hop'd thou should'st haue bin my Hamlets wife:
I thought thy Bride-bed to haue deckt (sweet Maid)
And not t'haue strew'd thy Graue

   Laer. Oh terrible woer,
Fall ten times trebble, on that cursed head
Whose wicked deed, thy most Ingenious sence
Depriu'd thee of. Hold off the earth a while,
Till I haue caught her once more in mine armes:

Leaps in the graue.

Now pile your dust, vpon the quicke, and dead,
Till of this flat a Mountaine you haue made,
To o're top old Pelion, or the skyish head
Of blew Olympus

   Ham. What is he, whose griefes
Beares such an Emphasis? whose phrase of Sorrow
Coniure the wandring Starres, and makes them stand
Like wonder-wounded hearers? This is I,
Hamlet the Dane

   Laer. The deuill take thy soule

   Ham. Thou prai'st not well,
I prythee take thy fingers from my throat;
Sir though I am not Spleenatiue, and rash,
Yet haue I something in me dangerous,
Which let thy wisenesse feare. Away thy hand

   King. Pluck them asunder

   Qu. Hamlet, Hamlet

   Gen. Good my Lord be quiet

   Ham. Why I will fight with him vppon this Theme.
Vntill my eielids will no longer wag

   Qu. Oh my Sonne, what Theame?
  Ham. I lou'd Ophelia; fortie thousand Brothers
Could not (with all there quantitie of Loue)
Make vp my summe. What wilt thou do for her?
  King. Oh he is mad Laertes,
  Qu. For loue of God forbeare him

   Ham. Come show me what thou'lt doe.
Woo't weepe? Woo't fight? Woo't teare thy selfe?
Woo't drinke vp Esile, eate a Crocodile?
Ile doo't. Dost thou come heere to whine;
To outface me with leaping in her Graue?
Be buried quicke with her, and so will I.
And if thou prate of Mountaines; let them throw
Millions of Akers on vs; till our ground
Sindging his pate against the burning Zone,
Make Ossa like a wart. Nay, and thou'lt mouth,
Ile rant as well as thou

   Kin. This is meere Madnesse:
And thus awhile the fit will worke on him:
Anon as patient as the female Doue,
When that her Golden Cuplet are disclos'd;
His silence will sit drooping

   Ham. Heare you Sir:
What is the reason that you vse me thus?
I lou'd you euer; but it is no matter:
Let Hercules himselfe doe what he may,
The Cat will Mew, and Dogge will haue his day.
Enter.

  Kin. I pray you good Horatio wait vpon him,
Strengthen your patience in our last nights speech,
Wee'l put the matter to the present push:
Good Gertrude set some watch ouer your Sonne,
This Graue shall haue a liuing Monument:
An houre of quiet shortly shall we see;
Till then, in patience our proceeding be.

Exeunt.

Enter Hamlet and Horatio

   Ham. So much for this Sir; now let me see the other,
You doe remember all the Circumstance

   Hor. Remember it my Lord?
  Ham. Sir, in my heart there was a kinde of fighting,
That would not let me sleepe; me thought I lay
Worse then the mutines in the Bilboes, rashly,
(And praise be rashnesse for it) let vs know,
Our indiscretion sometimes serues vs well,
When our deare plots do paule, and that should teach vs,
There's a Diuinity that shapes our ends,
Rough-hew them how we will

   Hor. That is most certaine

   Ham. Vp from my Cabin
My sea-gowne scarft about me in the darke,
Grop'd I to finde out them; had my desire,
Finger'd their Packet, and in fine, withdrew
To mine owne roome againe, making so bold,
(My feares forgetting manners) to vnseale
Their grand Commission, where I found Horatio,
Oh royall knauery: An exact command,
Larded with many seuerall sorts of reason;
Importing Denmarks health, and Englands too,
With hoo, such Bugges and Goblins in my life,
That on the superuize no leasure bated,
No not to stay the grinding of the Axe,
My head should be struck off

   Hor. Ist possible?
  Ham. Here's the Commission, read it at more leysure:
But wilt thou heare me how I did proceed?
  Hor. I beseech you

   Ham. Being thus benetted round with Villaines,
Ere I could make a Prologue to my braines,
They had begun the Play. I sate me downe,
Deuis'd a new Commission, wrote it faire,
I once did hold it as our Statists doe,
A basenesse to write faire; and laboured much
How to forget that learning: but Sir now,
It did me Yeomans seriuce: wilt thou know
The effects of what I wrote?
  Hor. I, good my Lord

   Ham. An earnest Coniuration from the King,
As England was his faithfull Tributary,
As loue betweene them, as the Palme should flourish,
As Peace should still her wheaten Garland weare,
And stand a Comma 'tweene their amities,
And many such like Assis of great charge,
That on the view and know of these Contents,
Without debatement further, more or lesse,
He should the bearers put to sodaine death,
Not shriuing time allowed

   Hor. How was this seal'd?
  Ham. Why, euen in that was Heauen ordinate;
I had my fathers Signet in my Purse,
Which was the Modell of that Danish Seale:
Folded the Writ vp in forme of the other,
Subscrib'd it, gau't th' impression, plac't it safely,
The changeling neuer knowne: Now, the next day
Was our Sea Fight, and what to this was sement,
Thou know'st already

   Hor. So Guildensterne and Rosincrance, go too't

   Ham. Why man, they did make loue to this imployment
They are not neere my Conscience; their debate
Doth by their owne insinuation grow:
'Tis dangerous, when the baser nature comes
Betweene the passe, and fell incensed points
Of mighty opposites

   Hor. Why, what a King is this?
  Ham. Does it not, thinkst thee, stand me now vpon
He that hath kil'd my King, and whor'd my Mother,
Popt in betweene th' election and my hopes,
Throwne out his Angle for my proper life,
And with such coozenage; is't not perfect conscience,
To quit him with this arme? And is't not to be damn'd
To let this Canker of our nature come
In further euill

   Hor. It must be shortly knowne to him from England
What is the issue of the businesse there

   Ham. It will be short,
The interim's mine, and a mans life's no more
Then to say one: but I am very sorry good Horatio,
That to Laertes I forgot my selfe;
For by the image of my Cause, I see
The Portraiture of his; Ile count his fauours:
But sure the brauery of his griefe did put me
Into a Towring passion

   Hor. Peace, who comes heere?
Enter young Osricke.

  Osr. Your Lordship is right welcome back to Denmarke

   Ham. I humbly thank you Sir, dost know this waterflie?
  Hor. No my good Lord

   Ham. Thy state is the more gracious; for 'tis a vice to
know him: he hath much Land, and fertile; let a Beast
be Lord of Beasts, and his Crib shall stand at the Kings
Messe; 'tis a Chowgh; but as I saw spacious in the possession
of dirt

   Osr. Sweet Lord, if your friendship were at leysure,
I should impart a thing to you from his Maiesty

   Ham. I will receiue it with all diligence of spirit; put
your Bonet to his right vse, 'tis for the head

   Osr. I thanke your Lordship, 'tis very hot

   Ham. No, beleeue mee 'tis very cold, the winde is
Northerly

   Osr. It is indifferent cold my Lord indeed

   Ham. Mee thinkes it is very soultry, and hot for my
Complexion

   Osr. Exceedingly, my Lord, it is very soultry, as 'twere
I cannot tell how: but my Lord, his Maiesty bad me signifie
to you, that he ha's laid a great wager on your head:
Sir, this is the matter

   Ham. I beseech you remember

   Osr. Nay, in good faith, for mine ease in good faith:
Sir, you are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes is at
his weapon

   Ham. What's his weapon?
  Osr. Rapier and dagger

   Ham. That's two of his weapons; but well

   Osr. The sir King ha's wag'd with him six Barbary horses,
against the which he impon'd as I take it, sixe French
Rapiers and Poniards, with their assignes, as Girdle,
Hangers or so: three of the Carriages infaith are very
deare to fancy, very responsiue to the hilts, most delicate
carriages, and of very liberall conceit

   Ham. What call you the Carriages?
  Osr. The Carriages Sir, are the hangers

   Ham. The phrase would bee more Germaine to the
matter: If we could carry Cannon by our sides; I would
it might be Hangers till then; but on sixe Barbary Horses
against sixe French Swords: their Assignes, and three
liberall conceited Carriages, that's the French but against
the Danish; why is this impon'd as you call it?
  Osr. The King Sir, hath laid that in a dozen passes betweene
you and him, hee shall not exceed you three hits;
He hath one twelue for mine, and that would come to
imediate tryall, if your Lordship would vouchsafe the
Answere

   Ham. How if I answere no?
  Osr. I meane my Lord, the opposition of your person
in tryall

   Ham. Sir, I will walke heere in the Hall; if it please
his Maiestie, 'tis the breathing time of day with me; let
the Foyles bee brought, the Gentleman willing, and the
King hold his purpose; I will win for him if I can: if
not, Ile gaine nothing but my shame, and the odde hits

   Osr. Shall I redeliuer you ee'n so?
  Ham. To this effect Sir, after what flourish your nature
will

   Osr. I commend my duty to your Lordship

   Ham. Yours, yours; hee does well to commend it
himselfe, there are no tongues else for's tongue

   Hor. This Lapwing runs away with the shell on his
head

   Ham. He did Complie with his Dugge before hee
suck't it: thus had he and mine more of the same Beauty
that I know the drossie age dotes on; only got the tune of
the time, and outward habite of encounter, a kinde of
yesty collection, which carries them through & through
the most fond and winnowed opinions; and doe but blow
them to their tryalls: the Bubbles are out

   Hor. You will lose this wager, my Lord

   Ham. I doe not thinke so, since he went into France,
I haue beene in continuall practice; I shall winne at the
oddes: but thou wouldest not thinke how all heere about
my heart: but it is no matter

   Hor. Nay, good my Lord

   Ham. It is but foolery; but it is such a kinde of
gain-giuing as would perhaps trouble a woman

   Hor. If your minde dislike any thing, obey. I will forestall
their repaire hither, and say you are not fit

   Ham. Not a whit, we defie Augury; there's a speciall
Prouidence in the fall of a sparrow. If it be now, 'tis not
to come: if it bee not to come, it will bee now: if it
be not now; yet it will come; the readinesse is all, since no
man ha's ought of what he leaues. What is't to leaue betimes?
Enter King, Queene, Laertes and Lords, with other Attendants with
Foyles,
and Gauntlets, a Table and Flagons of Wine on it.

  Kin. Come Hamlet, come, and take this hand from me

   Ham. Giue me your pardon Sir, I'ue done you wrong,
But pardon't as you are a Gentleman.
This presence knowes,
And you must needs haue heard how I am punisht
With sore distraction? What I haue done
That might your nature honour, and exception
Roughly awake, I heere proclaime was madnesse:
Was't Hamlet wrong'd Laertes? Neuer Hamlet.
If Hamlet from himselfe be tane away:
And when he's not himselfe, do's wrong Laertes,
Then Hamlet does it not, Hamlet denies it:
Who does it then? His Madnesse? If't be so,
Hamlet is of the Faction that is wrong'd,
His madnesse is poore Hamlets Enemy.
Sir, in this Audience,
Let my disclaiming from a purpos'd euill,
Free me so farre in your most generous thoughts,
That I haue shot mine Arrow o're the house,
And hurt my Mother

   Laer. I am satisfied in Nature,
Whose motiue in this case should stirre me most
To my Reuenge. But in my termes of Honor
I stand aloofe, and will no reconcilement,
Till by some elder Masters of knowne Honor,
I haue a voyce, and president of peace
To keepe my name vngorg'd. But till that time,
I do receiue your offer'd loue like loue,
And wil not wrong it

   Ham. I do embrace it freely,
And will this Brothers wager frankely play.
Giue vs the Foyles: Come on

   Laer. Come one for me

   Ham. Ile be your foile Laertes, in mine ignorance,
Your Skill shall like a Starre i'th' darkest night,
Sticke fiery off indeede

   Laer. You mocke me Sir

   Ham. No by this hand

   King. Giue them the Foyles yong Osricke,
Cousen Hamlet, you know the wager

   Ham. Verie well my Lord,
Your Grace hath laide the oddes a'th' weaker side

   King. I do not feare it,
I haue seene you both:
But since he is better'd, we haue therefore oddes

   Laer. This is too heauy,
Let me see another

   Ham. This likes me well,
These Foyles haue all a length.

Prepare to play.

  Osricke. I my good Lord

   King. Set me the Stopes of wine vpon that Table:
If Hamlet giue the first, or second hit,
Or quit in answer of the third exchange,
Let all the Battlements their Ordinance fire,
The King shal drinke to Hamlets better breath,
And in the Cup an vnion shal he throw
Richer then that, which foure successiue Kings
In Denmarkes Crowne haue worne.
Giue me the Cups,
And let the Kettle to the Trumpets speake,
The Trumpet to the Cannoneer without,
The Cannons to the Heauens, the Heauen to Earth,
Now the King drinkes to Hamlet. Come, begin,
And you the Iudges beare a wary eye

   Ham. Come on sir

   Laer. Come on sir.

They play.

  Ham. One

   Laer. No

   Ham. Iudgement

   Osr. A hit, a very palpable hit

   Laer. Well: againe

   King. Stay, giue me drinke.
Hamlet, this Pearle is thine,
Here's to thy health. Giue him the cup,

Trumpets sound, and shot goes off.

  Ham. Ile play this bout first, set by a-while.
Come: Another hit; what say you?
  Laer. A touch, a touch, I do confesse

   King. Our Sonne shall win

   Qu. He's fat, and scant of breath.
Heere's a Napkin, rub thy browes,
The Queene Carowses to thy fortune, Hamlet

   Ham. Good Madam

   King. Gertrude, do not drinke

   Qu. I will my Lord;
I pray you pardon me

   King. It is the poyson'd Cup, it is too late

   Ham. I dare not drinke yet Madam,
By and by

   Qu. Come, let me wipe thy face

   Laer. My Lord, Ile hit him now

   King. I do not thinke't

   Laer. And yet 'tis almost 'gainst my conscience

   Ham. Come for the third.
Laertes, you but dally,
I pray you passe with your best violence,
I am affear'd you make a wanton of me

   Laer. Say you so? Come on.

Play.

  Osr. Nothing neither way

   Laer. Haue at you now.

In scuffling they change Rapiers.

  King. Part them, they are incens'd

   Ham. Nay come, againe

   Osr. Looke to the Queene there hoa

   Hor. They bleed on both sides. How is't my Lord?
  Osr. How is't Laertes?
  Laer. Why as a Woodcocke
To mine Sprindge, Osricke,
I am iustly kill'd with mine owne Treacherie

   Ham. How does the Queene?
  King. She sounds to see them bleede

   Qu. No, no, the drinke, the drinke.
Oh my deere Hamlet, the drinke, the drinke,
I am poyson'd

   Ham. Oh Villany! How? Let the doore be lock'd.
Treacherie, seeke it out

   Laer. It is heere Hamlet.
Hamlet, thou art slaine,
No Medicine in the world can do thee good.
In thee, there is not halfe an houre of life;
The Treacherous Instrument is in thy hand,
Vnbated and envenom'd: the foule practise
Hath turn'd it selfe on me. Loe, heere I lye,
Neuer to rise againe: Thy Mothers poyson'd:
I can no more, the King, the King's too blame

   Ham. The point envenom'd too,
Then venome to thy worke.

Hurts the King.

  All. Treason, Treason

   King. O yet defend me Friends, I am but hurt

   Ham. Heere thou incestuous, murdrous,
Damned Dane,
Drinke off this Potion: Is thy Vnion heere?
Follow my Mother.

King Dyes.

  Laer. He is iustly seru'd.
It is a poyson temp'red by himselfe:
Exchange forgiuenesse with me, Noble Hamlet;
Mine and my Fathers death come not vpon thee,
Nor thine on me.

Dyes.

  Ham. Heauen make thee free of it, I follow thee.
I am dead Horatio, wretched Queene adiew,
You that looke pale, and tremble at this chance,
That are but Mutes or audience to this acte:
Had I but time (as this fell Sergeant death
Is strick'd in his Arrest) oh I could tell you.
But let it be: Horatio, I am dead,
Thou liu'st, report me and my causes right
To the vnsatisfied

   Hor. Neuer beleeue it.
I am more an Antike Roman then a Dane:
Heere's yet some Liquor left

   Ham. As th'art a man, giue me the Cup.
Let go, by Heauen Ile haue't.
Oh good Horatio, what a wounded name,
(Things standing thus vnknowne) shall liue behind me.
If thou did'st euer hold me in thy heart,
Absent thee from felicitie awhile,
And in this harsh world draw thy breath in paine,
To tell my Storie.

March afarre off, and shout within.

What warlike noyse is this?
Enter Osricke.

  Osr. Yong Fortinbras, with conquest come fro[m] Poland
To th' Ambassadors of England giues this warlike volly

   Ham. O I dye Horatio:
The potent poyson quite ore-crowes my spirit,
I cannot liue to heare the Newes from England,
But I do prophesie th' election lights
On Fortinbras, he ha's my dying voyce,
So tell him with the occurrents more and lesse,
Which haue solicited. The rest is silence. O, o, o, o.

Dyes

  Hora. Now cracke a Noble heart:
Goodnight sweet Prince,
And flights of Angels sing thee to thy rest,
Why do's the Drumme come hither?
Enter Fortinbras and English Ambassador, with Drumme, Colours,
and
Attendants.

  Fortin. Where is this sight?
  Hor. What is it ye would see;
If ought of woe, or wonder, cease your search

   For. His quarry cries on hauocke. Oh proud death,
What feast is toward in thine eternall Cell.
That thou so many Princes, at a shoote,
So bloodily hast strooke

   Amb. The sight is dismall,
And our affaires from England come too late,
The eares are senselesse that should giue vs hearing,
To tell him his command'ment is fulfill'd,
That Rosincrance and Guildensterne are dead:
Where should we haue our thankes?
  Hor. Not from his mouth,
Had it th' abilitie of life to thanke you:
He neuer gaue command'ment for their death.
But since so iumpe vpon this bloodie question,
You from the Polake warres, and you from England
Are heere arriued. Giue order that these bodies
High on a stage be placed to the view,
And let me speake to th' yet vnknowing world,
How these things came about. So shall you heare
Of carnall, bloudie, and vnnaturall acts,
Of accidentall iudgements, casuall slaughters
Of death's put on by cunning, and forc'd cause,
And in this vpshot, purposes mistooke,
Falne on the Inuentors head. All this can I
Truly deliuer

   For. Let vs hast to heare it,
And call the Noblest to the Audience.
For me, with sorrow, I embrace my Fortune,
I haue some Rites of memory in this Kingdome,
Which are to claime, my vantage doth
Inuite me,
  Hor. Of that I shall haue alwayes cause to speake,
And from his mouth
Whose voyce will draw on more:
But let this same be presently perform'd,
Euen whiles mens mindes are wilde,
Lest more mischance
On plots, and errors happen

   For. Let foure Captaines
Beare Hamlet like a Soldier to the Stage,
For he was likely, had he beene put on
To haue prou'd most royally:
And for his passage,
The Souldiours Musicke, and the rites of Warre
Speake lowdly for him.
Take vp the body; Such a sight as this
Becomes the Field, but heere shewes much amis.
Go, bid the Souldiers shoote.

Exeunt. Marching: after the which, a Peale of Ordenance are shot
off.


FINIS. The tragedie of HAMLET, Prince of Denmarke.

L'OPERA IN ITALIA.




I.

L'opera in Italia — Suo carattere popolaresco.


Ogni paese ha la sua lingua musicale, le cui peculiarità di concezione e
di costruzione si formarono a poco a poco e furon tramandate più o meno
fedelmente dai musicisti. Così, più o meno interrottamente ebbe ed ha
tuttora una lingua musicale originale la Francia, così l'ebbe l'Italia e
l'ha tuttora sebbene un poco modificata da veri e propri barbarismi, di
cui la sorgente è o la musica francese o, se non sempre direttamente, la
musica tedesca e, meglio, la musica wagneriana. E per linguaggio
musicale moderno dell'Italia intendo di necessità il linguaggio del
melodramma, poichè da quando comparvero i grandi compositori di musica
strumentale in Germania, questo genere di musica in Italia divenne
fatica di retori plagiari e pesanti. Abbiamo infatti noi dei
quartettisti da mettere a paro con Haydn Mozart Beethoven? Può un sol
quartetto del nostro accademico Bazzini sostenere il confronto d'un
qualunque quartetto dei classici tedeschi? E di tutti gli scrittori di
musica per pianoforte e di musica sinfonica non teatrale, chi è riuscito
ancora a dire agli Italiani una parola _sua_, a farci scordare
l'instante tirannia di Beethoven di Schumann di Liszt di Wagner? Non è,
anzi, senza una ragione profonda il contegno indifferentissimo del
pubblico italiano verso i così detti scrittori di musica seria. Infatti
il buon pubblico innocente e ignorante sente istintivamente che sotto
quelle dotte polifonie ben imitate da chi ne seppe più ed ebbe cuore più
nuovo e più sensibile, c'è un silenzio inutile, c'è il triste vuoto di
colui che non ha forza fantastica tale da plasmare spontaneamente una
nuova forma sinfonica veramente latina.

Mancando dunque i grandi lirici personali, le grandi individualità
musicali che si esprimano ciascuna con un glorioso linguaggio che sembri
assorbire e contenere tutto il vocabolario musicale d'un'epoca o di un
popolo, in Italia risponde moltissimo al gusto popolare l'opera. E non
l'opera quale Wagner aveva concepita: altissima tragedia musicale,
profonda di poesia e di pensiero; ma il semplice melodramma popolaresco,
in cui il libretto, generalmente, invece di essere un'intuizione poetica
del mondo quale la _Dannazione di Faust_, o il _Tristano e Isotta_, non
ha altro ufficio che prestare al compositore dei personaggi senza
articolazioni, forniti di ottima gola per cantare. Sicchè, sieno pure
tali personaggi vivi, indovinati, oppure astrazioni irreali, cadaveri
ambulanti per sola virtù di retorica, ciò non importa. L'essenziale è di
situarli e d'aggrupparli in modo che essi possano cantare molte melodie.
Chè di queste sono gravidi i compositori italiani, e di queste ghiotti
gli ascoltatori italiani.

Tuttavia anche la melodia italiana ha subito delle trasformazioni
sebbene esteriori. Non più l'accurata lasciva cantilena della scuola
napoletana; non più i gai gargarizzi dell'opera buffa, fra i quali
talora zampillava qualche larga monodia d'una dolcezza impreveduta.
Verdi l'agitatore di popolo, come Garibaldi fu creatore di eroi, sembrò
avere scosso l'inerzia molle e l'allegra indifferenza in cui amava esser
cullata e illusa l'animula italiana. O meglio, era il popolo italiano
che, risuscitato dai soffi primaverili del risorgimento, esigeva un'arte
melodica nuova: la melodia della passione sfrenata e cieca, della
passione che ricordasse la ribellione, che sapesse un po' di polvere e
di sangue. Verdi fu la voce del nuovo bisogno. I libretti si popolarono
di situazioni drammatiche irte di spasimo e di ferocia. E alle tenui
cantilene, agli affetti leziosi e di poco palpito, subentrarono modi di
canto dalla tessitura più audace, dalla struttura ritmica più marcata e
violenta, e forti effetti corali e strumentali, e finali «allegro
furioso» atti ad ubbriacare i loggioni avidi di commozioni rapide e
brutali.

Se non che anche l'arte Verdiana rimase nella sostanza simile a quella
dei predecessori; arte, cioè, sempre primitiva nel contenuto sebbene
spesso perfetta nella forma, profondamente sensuale, di tinte accecanti,
di un sentimentalismo un po' barocco, ma spesso franco e sincero; arte
che, prossima forse ora al suo tramonto, non è destinata del tutto
all'oblio, ma è meritevole di esser frammentata da una critica
spassionata e rigorosa in una specie di florilegio contenente le più
belle ispirazioni dei nostri ottocentisti, delle quali dobbiamo, e a
ragione, esser gelosi, se non altro per non interrompere le più pure
tradizioni del nostro linguaggio musicale[1].

  [1] Del resto certe selezioni si fanno talora senza aiuto della
  critica, ma quasi per una spontanea critica insita negli
  esecutori. Infatti dei molti melodrammi che in Italia sono stati
  composti da che la camerata del Conte de' Bardi ideò il genere
  dell'opera, che cosa è rimasto, se non qualche aria, staccata,
  senza danno reciproco, dall'opera a cui apparteneva, per esser
  cantata nei concerti?

Ora, Pietro Mascagni appunto è un continuatore degli operisti popolari.
Non ostante la preparazione più accurata, il possesso d'un'orchestra più
ricca, più colorita e più flessibile, egli rimane un melodista fresco,
facile, talvolta futile, ma quasi sempre trascinante per la esuberante
ed ingenua passionalità. Egli, pur avendo una personalità diversissima
da quella di Rossini e di Verdi e, come Rossini e Verdi, impersonando la
nuova mediocrità mentale della terza Italia, non è che un continuatore
in linea retta di Verdi e di Rossini; prezioso, ammirevole per questa
sua bella italianità (che a dir vero non possiede molto Puccini forse
meno ingenuo, ma d'una sentimentalità troppo infranciosata, sul tipo del
buon Massenet); colpevole, come quelli, di essere così al disotto della
vasta cultura e della profonda coscienza dello spirito umano che hanno
avuto i grandi d'ogni tempo.




II.

Retorica nell'opera italiana.


Poichè se ogni arte è condizionata nella libertà del suo contenuto, vi
sono però artisti che nascono e si sviluppano quasi al di sopra della
mentalità comune, violentando, se troppo angusti, i limiti della storia
di cui sono figli, sebbene serbando profondamente conficcate le radici
in quella storia stessa. L'operista italiano, invece, ha, quasi sempre,
una mentalità del tutto immersa, anzi sommersa, nel flutto della
mediocrissima vita che lo circonda. Egli è così un'anima semplice, di
quella semplicità un poco artefatta delle anime popolari, che non appena
venga varcata da noi, ci desta un'antipatia irrimediabile. Certo
nell'arte non vi è progresso, ma vi è progresso nelle condizioni del suo
contenuto. Ponendo il caso d'un uomo che da fanciullo abbia vissuto tra
il popolo e abbia sentito com'esso sente, e che, dopo, esperienze
diverse portarono a conoscere una vita più alta, più ignuda di
pregiudizi e di debolezze, non ci meraviglierà che quest'uomo sorrida
con commiserazione della sua infanzia. Infatti non c'è cosa più erronea
del credere che l'anima popolare sia la più genuina che vi possa essere.
La sua forza di sentire potrà essere, ed è spesso, più violenta della
nostra, ma l'esattezza delle impressioni, la elevatezza del gusto, la
chiarezza del pensiero, cresce in ragione che ci innalziamo e ci
allontaniamo dallo stato confuso e bolso della vita popolare[2].

  [2] Avverto una volta per tutte che il popolo di cui parlo qui non
  è il popolo delle campagne e delle montagne, spesso puro e a suo
  modo profondo; ma parlo del popolo delle città e dei grossi
  borghi, al quale si attagliano benissimo le mie osservazioni.

Ognuno di noi se proprio da fanciullo non sia stato figlio del popolo,
può avere sperimentato, conoscendo qualche parrucchiere o qualche
tappezziere o penetrando nell'intimità d'una famiglia del popolo, tutto
il misto di grottescamente falso e di ingenuamente vero, che contengono
i sentimenti del volgo e le loro estrinsecazioni. Ora sarà il baleno
d'un concetto larghissimo, che l'ingenuo buon senso sfiora riempiendoci
di stupore; ora sarà la vana ripetizione male a proposito d'un trito
sofisma che ci urta e ci disgusta; ora sarà una intuizione splendida,
quattro o cinque parole, un'osservazione psicologica, un'intonazione, un
arabesco della voce d'uno che canta per i campi, che ci infondono un
vero e proprio brivido estetico; ora sarà la deformazione di non so
quale orribile verso d'uno dei tanti poetucoli italiani retorici e
mentitori, per lo più a scopo di volgari sottintesi carnali, che ci farà
voltare nauseati da un'altra parte.

L'arte popolare o di chi anche a traverso studi relativamente superiori,
si può pur sempre chiamar popolo, presenta queste bellezze e questo
grottesco, questa curiosa mistura di pura semplicità e nitidezza nella
visione ed espressione, e di tronfiezza ridicola. Così assistendo, per
es., ad un'opera di Giuseppe Verdi, è per noi una continua oscillazione
tra l'aere sereno della bellezza e il tanfo opprimente della retorica.
Ma intendiamoci bene sul carattere specialissimo di questa retorica.
Essa è come una retorica iniziale, una retorica delle condizioni in cui
s'è formato il contenuto. Quando tutto l'ambiente storico in cui un
artista si sviluppa, commette un errore comune, è difficile che
quell'artista, se non provvisto di un punto d'appoggio per giudicare, di
richiami critici per verificare, possa eroicamente difendere il proprio
contenuto da quella specie di morbo universale. Onde avviene che si
formano certi schemi di arte, in cui la visione degli artisti vissuti
nello stesso ambiente storico sembra avere un _punctum caecum_ sempre
allo stesso posto. Per esempio, v'è nell'opera italiana un luogo più
comune delle così dette _arie della pazzia_, _scena della maledizione_,
_scena del riconoscimento_, _scena d'amore_, _scena della morte_? Però,
superata da noi la noia che c'infligge questa costante retorica di
situazioni, talvolta niente è più bello della melodia che il compositore
trovò per tale situazione trita e ritrita. Al modo stesso, nella
musica religiosa di Bach, la condizione del contenuto essendo
convenzionalissima, le cantate del maestro di Eisenach, eccettuati
alcuni recitativi ed alcuni cori, consistevano sempre in arie e in
duetti in cui il vanerello amore agghindato e incipriato e imparruccato
dell'anima per il suo innamoratissimo padre, era espresso con sempre
nuova eleganza sincera dal compositore, che non sospettava affatto
quanto fosse indecoroso per l'anima e per Dio tenere quel contegno da
Florindo e Rosaura. In questo caso, come nel caso delle situazioni
melodrammatiche dell'opera italiana, noi non possiamo chiamare retorica
la forma musicale (talvolta bellissima se staccata dal contesto col
quale ha relazioni che noi non possiamo sopportare); ma retorica, le
condizioni in cui è sorta tale musica; la quale anche ai contemporanei
parve bellissima e fu da quelli medesimi _ben distinta_ dalla musica
veramente _retorica_, cioè la vecchia intuizione, il vecchio motivo, la
volgare modulazione ripetuta ormai a sazietà.

E in che cosa, se non in questa sincerità e convenzionalità aventi
ineluttabili ragioni storiche, va cercata la spiegazione di quel fatto
che notava lo Hanslick, che nulla è più cedevole al tempo e alla moda
(cioè alle mutevoli condizioni del superficiale sentimento popolare)
delle forme della musica teatrale? I nostri nonni hanno infatti pianto
alle settecentesche smanie della Vestale colpevole di Spontini, come i
nostri bravi loggioni moderni palpitano e fremono all'eroismo da sartine
e da commessi viaggiatori della _Bohème_ o si commuovono all'apoteosi da
giornale illustrato della mousmè Iris, cortigiana abortita per
ignoranza. E, parimente, i nostri padri vibrarono dinanzi alle
victorughiane idealizzazioni del buffone di corte Rigoletto, come i loro
rispettivi bisnonni erano andati in solluchero alle graziette lascive e
seducenti della Serva che non contenta del possesso carnale d'un vecchio
padrone di provincia, ne vuol sancito il dominio con un bel matrimonio.
Come si vede il fenomeno è vecchio e a forza di nonni e di bisnonni si
potrebbe senza fatica risalire, seguendone le traccie, a Plauto e chissà
quanto più su.




III.

Ciò che simboleggia Pietro Mascagni nell'opera moderna italiana.


Pietro Mascagni, ho detto, è un discendente in linea retta degli
operisti italiani. Al pari di loro, egli non mira che a destare i
tumultuosi fremiti salienti dalle platee, ruinanti come uragano dai
loggioni, con delle scene che afferrino l'attenzione del pubblico alla
prima audizione, con dei finali coronati di quelle folgori degli ottoni,
senza delle quali il volgo non crede all'esistenza del miracolo. Nelle
sue opere scorrono, ondeggiano dal principio alla fine, fiumane di
melodia che inebriano le anime di ebbrezze facili e passeggere. Un
motivo di Beethoven o di Wagner difficilmente diventerà possesso comune,
il contenuto di cui è riempito essendo soltanto parzialmente accessibile
al pubblico, il quale non ama le conquiste faticose. La profondità e la
fedeltà dell'amore non son molto comuni tra le persone volgari e le
opere dei classici (ossia dei grandi) non trovano nel popolo la pazienza
vigile che esigono per esser comprese, la qual pazienza di comprensione
è già essa quasi una genialità, educata a lungo e sviluppata con rigore
di cultura.

Il canto in Mascagni è sottolineato da un'orchestrazione, a cui la
ricchezza coloristica dei timbri non toglie un carattere di semplicità
affatto contrario alla complessità tematica delle grandi creazioni
sinfoniche. Per i nostri vecchi le opere di Pietro Mascagni possono
significare ai loro cuori e cervelli conclusi nel loro ormai giovanile
passato, un intedescamento della musica. Ma questa è un'illusione. È
vero bensì che anche l'opera mascagnana ha risentito del decadimento del
bel canto, e del sopravvento su questo dell'orchestra a commentatrice
del dramma. Ma, nella realtà, la melodia, sia pur trasmigrata dalle
fresche gole umane nei numerosi strumenti dell'orchestra, è rimasta la
vecchia melodia italiana dalle forme regolari, dai blandi ritornelli,
dalla serena cadenza finale coronata da una nota tenuta per far piacere
alla voce dei cantanti e all'orecchio del pubblico, che ama i cantanti
un po' simili a lottatori di molta resistenza. E gli intermezzi
mascagnani, i preludi, e i famosi _commenti orchestrali_ alla fine o
d'un'aria o di un duetto (commenti che sono poi stati imitati da tutti i
mediocri compositori moderni italiani, compresovi uno non mediocre,
Lorenzo Perosi), che altro sono se non sempre, melodia, vecchia melodia
italiana, meglio vestita, più sonoramente versata negli orecchi degli
uditori, più argutamente organizzata? E non se ne sentono infatti
intuonar gli echi per le strade insieme coi motivi più amati di Rossini,
di Bellini, di Donizzetti, di Verdi? Oh! non temano i nostri vecchi! non
sarà Mascagni che _intedescherà_ l'opera italiana! Egli ha ereditato una
delle nature più italiane (nel senso popolare) che ci sieno mai state.
Se i vecchi non lo capiscono, è che alla retorica dei cori di guerrieri
medioevali, di sacerdoti romani, di schiave orientali, etc., etc., è
succeduta una retorica più nuova, la retorica delle lavandaie
giapponesi, dei ladroni scozzesi, dei contadini alpigiani, e più di
tutto, la ormai non più recente retorica dell'enfasi strumentale «che
dall'orchestra prorompe». Tutte cose che se non son consentanee ai gusti
dei fedeli del Prati, di Victor Hugo e del Guerrazzi, non vogliono
precisamente dire che Pietro Mascagni non appaia nella sostanza italiano
quanto Verdi agli italiani d'oggidì.

Certo profondamente diversa è la sua personalità da quelle dei maestri
italiani della vecchia scuola. Al periodo epico del risorgimento di cui
fu interprete fedele il romantico Verdi, è successo un periodo in cui
l'Italia sembra ritornata per un lato quasi ai tempi di Rossini, per un
altro ha acquistato una qualità dolorosa, che allora non aveva, un
dolore cioè di passione che fa soffrire, un rifiorimento più agitato
della malinconia erotica dei Paisiello e dei Pergolese. E Mascagni è il
cantore delle sensazioni fresche, della carne giovanile, della cieca
salute, del riso gaio della folla nei giorni di festa, e del dolore
della carne tradita per un'altra carne. Certo a lungo andare questo
trionfo di carne, di riso, di allegria, di dolore che non piange che per
amore, per amore, per amore, è monocorde, è monotono, e stanca. Ma quali
melodie sane non spicciano fuori da questa vena limpidissima! Che orgia
di canto! che gaiezza rimbalzante di suoni, nitidi, tinnuli, sgargianti
come i colori che si vedono in una fiera! Certo, e in un senso è bene,
si può essere ostili all'autore della _Monferrina_ dell'_Amica_. Ma
anche i più ostili, coloro che più si sono allontanati da questa arte
così angusta d'orizzonte, per essere stati bruciati da ben altri
spiriti, profondi come abissi solcanti fino alle viscere l'umana natura,
non possono fare a meno di ridere a scrosci, di urlar di gioia e di
dolore bestiale con questo mago che al posto del cuore ci ha un nido,
donde balzano alate le più fresche canzoni d'un popolo.




IV.

Mascagni nella musica europea.


Forse in nessun tempo la tenuità d'un compositore italiano non profondo,
ma sincero, non sapiente, ma astuto, fu più discussa, anzi talvolta
neppure onorata della discussione — molti critici si arrestano dinanzi
alla _volgarità_ di Mascagni e non osano progredire più in là —, come
oggi accade per Mascagni. E se ne comprende facilmente il perchè. Ai
tempi di Rossini, per es., nonostante che il grandissimo e allora ignoto
(o quasi) Beethoven impersonasse e superasse le grandi correnti
letterarie e umane del romanticismo, l'Europa era solcata da larghi
soffi di leggerezza un po' scettica, e, sebbene l'_opera buffa_ e
l'_opera seria_ avessero trovato dei compositori molto più eletti e, a
loro modo, più profondi di Rossini (ad es.: Cherubini), fu però Rossini
che con il fuoco indiavolato del suo brio di gaudente li superò tutti,
vellicando in modo insuperabile quella voglia matta di divertirsi, e
creando un capolavoro magnifico d'opera comica, il _Barbiere di
Siviglia_, e un capolavoro altrettanto magnifico d'opera seria, il
_Guglielmo Tell_. Se non che erano dei capolavori sì, ma dei capolavori
relativi alla superficialità del tempo. Tempo nel quale pareva quasi che
la vera grandezza fosse riserbata ai poeti e ai filosofi, i quali
accettavano la piccolezza dell'opera musicale, dandole chissà quale
interpretazione fantastica. Così Schopenhauer, complessa natura di
pensatore d'artista e di _viveur_, s'estasiava davanti alla _volontà di
vivere_ del ridente Rossini, al modo stesso che il suo figlio spirituale
Nietzsche perdeva la testa davanti alla musica «dai piè leggeri come il
vento» della _Carmen_, la quale per lui simboleggiava nientemeno, che
l'astutissima flessibile adorabile musica _mediterranea_. E si sa quanto
oro, quanto tepore, quanto profumo meridionale contenesse per il poeta
del Riso questo vocabolo di «mediterraneo».

Comunque, era sempre la poesia (o la critica poetica: se più piace) che
dava un'arbitraria grandezza alla musica. La vera grandezza, ripeto, era
riserbata soltanto ai poeti e ai filosofi.

Il grazioso e un po' affettato Mozart, il gaio adolescente
settecentesco, dal sorriso malizioso e dai languori affettuosi e
delicati, aveva creato _un'opera buffa_ imperitura, figlia e nipote dei
gloriosi modelli italiani, e il cui tipo aveva incontrato le grazie di
tutti i compositori italiani. Più che a tutti piacque a Rossini, che
soleva chiamar Mozart il «Dio della musica»; la quale opinione perdura
ancora nella coscienza di alcuni, tanto che, se non erro, in un manuale
di musica moderno, ebbi a leggere con un certo stupore, come Mozart
fosse il più gran genio che della musica sia mai esistito, un uomo così
sbalorditivamente musicista che trasformava in musica tutto quello che
toccava. Non so la paternità di questa frase, ma se la sapessi,
domanderei a chi la disse per il primo, che cosa faceva Wagner di quello
che toccava: forse dei tromboni? Ad ogni modo Mozart è un caro fanciullo
gaio e sereno, ma niente più di questo. Alcuni, tra i quali un grande
conoscitore di musica, Romain Rolland, vogliono trovare in lui una
saggezza profonda. Ma io sarei più propenso a credere che, intessuta
d'una più delicata e gentile sentimentalità tedesca, anche in Mozart sia
la consueta leggera retorica settecentesca del mite Metastasio, e di
tutti i suoi fratelli letterati, amanti dei grandi nomi eroici e degli
intrecci da teatro di burattini.

Beethoven fu il primo che rialzò la musica all'altezza della grande
poesia; e potendo, anzi forse dovendo dire della grande arte, dico
volentieri della poesia, pensando a Goethe, del quale Beethoven fu
l'unico fratello, da alcuni creduto anche maggiore. Con Beethoven la
musica potè aspirare ai più alti destini. Anche Bach, Händel,
Palestrina, Orlando di Lasso, Monteverdi, etc., furono grandi; ma
nessuno di loro è degno di esser messo tra i più alti spiriti intuitivi,
la cui apparizione segna come una nuova tappa nel lungo cammino
dell'umanità. Poichè con Beethoven per la prima volta la musica passa
dal valore di arte decorativa, di arte di abbellimento, di «inclita arte
a raddolcir la vita», al valore di arte intima, quasi direi _di arte di
coscienza_, rispecchiante tutto un momento storico dello spirito umano
in tutti i suoi meandri, in tutte le sue contradizioni, in tutte le sue
aspirazioni più significative. Beethoven è il primo musicista
_universale_; la civiltà ellenica ebbe Fidia, la civiltà medioevale ebbe
Dante, la civiltà del rinascimento ebbe Shakespeare, la civiltà
modernissima, che è ancora la nostra, ha Beethoven. Con lui anche i
musicisti sentirono con orgoglio che a loro non toccava più d'imbandire
con le briciole cadute dal banchetto dei grandi il loro modesto
banchetto di servitori. Così si ebbe una nuova musica di nuovi
musicisti, nuovi d'anima d'arte di valore storico; Wagner, Berlioz,
Schumann, Chopin, con diversa fortuna e con diversa bontà
d'intendimenti, furono i veri poeti dell'Europa nell'800. Come dice
Romain Rolland nella sua splendida prefazione ai _Musiciens
d'autrefois_: «la lumiére (dell'arte) ne cesse pas de brûler; seulement
elle se déplace, elle va _d'un art à l'autre_, comme d'un peuple à
l'autre.» Dopo Goethe, grandissimi poeti dovemmo aspettar molto ad
averne. Ma quali musicisti non fiorirono, profondissimi poeti del loro
tempo che è, in gran parte, sempre il nostro! La musica divenne un
linguaggio meravigliosamente eloquente, pieghevole, policromo, atto a
rendere tutte le più mutevoli sfumature della psiche, la quale sembrava
fino ad allora ribelle alle forme troppo dure e incerte dell'armonia,
simili quasi all'intirizzimento delle statue prefidiache. Beethoven,
sopratutti, poi Wagner Berlioz Schumann Chopin empirono la storia di
opere d'arte in cui i suoni raggiunsero la potenza espressiva della
lingua multisecolare della poesia. Soltanto forse nella Grecia
armoniosa, nel trecento eroico dell'Italia, s'incontra un periodo d'arte
da paragonare a questa immensa ricchezza musicale dell'800.

Ma, ohimè, quell'immenso fremito d'armonia oggi si è spento. L'arte no,
non si è spenta, chè è riapparsa per es., in Italia sotto le spoglie
gloriose della poesia. Nessuno forse infatti ha mai pensato a scoprire
le infinite somiglianze che i musicisti dell'800 collegano con i nostri
poeti del 900. L'arte di Riccardo Wagner e l'arte di Gabriele d'Annunzio
hanno delle relazioni che nessuno s'è mai ancora proposto d'indagare. Ma
la musica è moribonda. A Riccardo I è succeduto Riccardo II, lo Strauss,
il musicista che nonostante il suo contenuto decadente, e il suo
stile barocco, mostra per certa sua robustezza, di esser sempre d'una
gloriosissima razza di musicisti. A Berlioz, è succeduto (sebbene non
spiritualmente) il piccolo Debussy wagneriano a rovescio, che tenta
d'imbastardire la grande musica francese obbedendo a dei falsi canoni
estetici (il discorso continuo, la guerra alla cadenza come simbolo
della rotondità perfetta della forma musicale, il crepuscolo armonico, e
finalmente l'_impressionismo_ rubato alla pittura), e con dei gusti
letterarii ormai stantii (Mallarmé, Verlaine, Baudelaire, etc).

Ora queste anime raffinatissime, malate di dilettantismo estetico e di
un infecondo criticismo, se con i loro sforzi, impotenti ancora a
generare una grande êra musicale, conservano accesa la lampada
semispenta della grande musica e accumulano le faticose e talvolta
oziose esperienze che serviranno a far più possente il futuro linguaggio
della musica[3]; esagerano però la posizione di dispregio che verso la
popolaresca opera italiana tennero i loro grandi padri. Ma quanto più
melanconica è questa loro posizione di quella d'un Wagner verso, per es.
un Giuseppe Verdi! Il popolo ha sempre tradito i grandi. Ma se oggi il
pubblico diserta i teatri ove si eseguisca Strauss o Debussy, per andare
ad ascoltare _L'Amico Fritz_ o la _Cavalleria Rusticana_, la critica non
può dar assolutamente torto al pubblico.

  [3] Se gli increduli volessero per prova di ciò che affermo
  un'analogia nella storia della musica, pensino alle costruzioni
  architettonico-contrappuntistiche dei sec. XIII e XIV, dalle cui
  aberrazioni armoniche doveva nascere la moderna armonia.

Poichè, è vero, Riccardo Strauss e Claudio Debussy e i loro minori
compagni, sopra il nostro Mascagni hanno una superiorità di cultura di
pensiero di nobiltà d'aspirazioni. Ma si può poi dire che essi cantino
all'Europa un contenuto nuovo e necessario? La nuova generazione che
vien su ora, o che _deve_ necessariamente venir su ora, non travolgerà
essi pure nella sua ribellione contro tutti i sofismi moralistici e
tutte le falsificazioni del sentimento dei Verlaine, dei Wilde, dei
D'Annunzio? Chi è Salomè od Elettra se non una Basiliola e una Fedra più
che mai inferocite nella loro libidine monotona dal macabro ritmo d'una
musica di barbaro degenerato? E che cosa significa la coppia
bamboleggiante di Pelléas e Melisanda se non un tentativo della stanca
anima europea a ritornare a una semplicità sublime che essa non sa più
concepire (avendone da tempo perduta la strada), che come una
adolescenza di bambini tardivi? No; la musica europea è in decadenza. I
suoi rappresentanti maggiori si esauriscono in sforzi formali vuoti di
contenuto, o pieni d'un sì ridicolo contenuto, che il buon popolo sano e
ribelle alle corruzioni senili delle così dette classi superiori, quando
non sia sbalordito dal fragore, o dal terrore del silenzio, disapprova
ed irride del suo meglio.

E davanti allo Strauss e al Debussy il piccolo Mascagni, a cui la musica
scoppia nel cuore come una polla irruente, a volte un po' torba, ma
spesso tersa, pulita e chiara, è quasi l'incarnazione, per chi sa
leggere l'infinito linguaggio della storia e trovarvi la rivelazione di
quella storia metafisica su cui essa eternamente corre e ricorre, d'una
profonda verità estetica. È vero che è il valore del contenuto che fa
grande l'arte; ma esso è soltanto relativo, e non fa che piccola o
immensa l'opera d'arte, insignificante o luminosa nei secoli la visione
dell'artista. Ciò che fa davvero che l'arte sia arte, è la forma; senza
di questa il contenuto (o il desiderio, il presentimento del contenuto)
non raggiunge l'esistenza estetica, ed è inutile che se ne parli _come
di arte_. Che importa se Debussy è uno spirito più eletto più colto più
sottile più profondo di Pietro Mascagni? La sua forma è per ora uno
_sforzo_, un atto volontario, non spontaneo del suo spirito; mentre la
musica di Mascagni spesso raggiunge nel suo piccolo la perfezione; anzi,
talvolta, come negli _intermezzi_ della _Cavalleria_ e dell'_Amico
Fritz_, nella _romanza_ dell'_Iris_, nella _Monferrina_ dell'_Amica_
sembra rievocare più cosciente e più profonda, la candida melanconia
d'un Paisiello o d'un Pergolesi e quel loro gaio sorriso così calmo e
così refrigerante.

Certo è triste dover rassegnarsi a cercare la _musica_; non la
_preparazione_ alla musica futura, ma la musica veramente viva, nei
piccoli. Ma meglio dei grandi che non esistono i piccoli che esistono.
Nè voglio dire che, tra i piccoli, Pietro Mascagni sia solo; voglio
soltanto dire che, dinanzi alla terribile crisi che fa agonizzare la
grande musica europea, l'Italia trova in Mascagni un puro rappresentante
della sua vecchia opera popolaresca[4].

  [4] Non è accennato in questo mio rapido quadro delle condizioni
  della musica europea disegnato a scopo di inquadrarvi Mascagni,
  alla musica russa. Giacchè essa nella sua forma più genuina (cioè
  non nelle sue imitazioni italiane del 700 e tedesche dell'800) ha
  un cammino e uno spirito assolutamente diversi dallo spirito e dal
  cammino della musica europea. Oserei quasi dire che essa è quasi
  una musica asiatica. Lo stesso Chopin non è fratello ai nostri
  compositori.




L'OPERA DI PIETRO MASCAGNI.




I.

Cavalleria rusticana.


_Cavalleria rusticana_, il bel dramma musicale in un atto, che il
Mascagni scrisse tra i 25 e i 27 anni, e che fu la sua prima opera
rappresentata in pubblico, è forse, per ora, l'opera più completa che ci
abbia dato il compositore livornese. Non che nelle opere posteriori
egli, come molti pensano, non abbia più dato alla nostra musica dei
brani di bellezza paragonabile a questa freschissima _Cavalleria_. Però,
oltre al fatto che il maestro, dopo quest'opera curata in tutte le sue
parti, ha pur egli ripreso il vecchio andazzo dagli operisti italiani di
abborracciar spartiti ammassando alla rinfusa bellezze e sciatterie,
lampi di genio e volgarità inaudite; a impedire al Mascagni di ridarci
un'altra opera interamente bella — se dalla condanna si eccettui in
parte l'ispiratissima _Iris_ — sta l'altro fatto che egli non ha saputo
svolgere in sè alcun germe fecondo di coltura. La qual cosa gli ha fatto
accettare, come musicabili, libretti o difettosi o affatto incompatibili
con la sua natura musicale. Giacchè coltura non vuol dire aver letto,
sia pure con accesa passione, altissimi scrittori, come, ad es. aveva
fatto indubbiamente Giuseppe Verdi. Che quest'ultimo non avesse capito
Shakespeare — che pare egli avesse letto assai estesamente — ce lo
dicono quelle cattive riduzioni melodrammatiche vittorughiane dei due
capolavori shakespeariani: il _Macbeth_ e l'_Otello_. Del quale
_Otello_, musicalmente non solo superiore al _Macbeth_, ma a quasi tutta
l'opera verdiana, il Boito e il Verdi compierono una vera e propria
_traduzione_ ad uso dei vanagloriosi cantanti del barocco teatro
melodrammatico; sicchè il disgraziato eroe orientale, nel testo inglese
gentiluomo nobilissimo qual s'addiceva essere a un figlio della razza
più squisitamente signorile che esista, la razza moresca, diventa
nell'opera verdiana un villano tenore che non sa esprimere la propria
ira che urlando come un ossesso. Non parlo poi di quello che diventa
Iago, la creatura ambigua tortuosa oscura dell'immenso poeta del
cinquecento.

Ora, a dire il vero, io non so la quantità e la qualità delle letture
con le quali è supponibile abbia adornato il proprio spirito il nostro
Mascagni. So però con certezza che se esiste, la sua coltura è ben
lontana dal raggiungere quel grado di ricchezza, armonia, solidità e
signorilità, che permetteva al Wagner di emulare in questo i più grandi
poeti e di permettersi il lusso di ricreare con tanto sapore storico e
con tanta precisione di particolari scenici poetici e musicali
l'ambiente della barocca e gentile Norimberga della metà del
cinquecento. Se un nostro compositore tentasse di risuscitare, p. es.,
la Firenze del 400 o la Roma del 600 o la Venezia del 700, chissà a
quali orribili gare di cattivo gusto e d'incredibile ignoranza ci
toccherebbe ad assistere!

Comunque, il caso offrì al Mascagni un ottimo libretto nella _Cavalleria
Rusticana_ dei sigg. Targioni-Tozzetti e Menasci, breve poema drammatico
tolto dalla omonima notissima novella di Giovanni Verga. Io non pretendo
dire che l'aggiunta del fallo di Santa (Santuzza nel libretto) col
fidanzato Turiddu e la trasformazione dei «vicini» in un coro assai
melodrammaticamente risibile, abbiano abbellito la primitiva concezione
del Verga. Questo nostro grande novelliere-poeta, non accennando ad
alcun fallo di Santuzza accresce, a parer mio, la naturalezza del suo
racconto, naturalezza così impreveduta nella nostra quasi sempre
inverosimile novellistica, per altre ragioni che la possibilità
dell'azione, pregevole. Certo però, questo fallo di Santuzza se sciupa
un po' la semplicità della concezione drammatica, porse al Mascagni,
acuendo la ferocia dell'azione fulminea, una ragione di più per
impiegare le tinte più calde dello sua violenta tavolozza musicale. È
vero altresì che rimproverare ai librettisti di aver falsata la
concezione verghiana, è dimenticarsi che la _Cavalleria_ di Mascagni non
ha ormai più alcun legame estetico con la _Cavalleria_ del Verga,
trattandosi di due intuizioni diverse.

Il Mascagni trovò dunque nel disegno offertogli dai due librettisti,
tutti gli stimoli necessari per esplicare la sua personalità.
Difficilmente nella storia delle arti troviamo un fatto simile. Il
Mascagni delle opere successive non ha aggiunto nulla di veramente nuovo
al mondo espresso nella _Cavalleria_, se se ne eccettua il rinnovamento
puramente tecnico dell'_Iris_, che può essere anche una presa di
possesso più chiara e più audace della propria personalità. E non perchè
egli dopo non si sia più svolto, come troppo leggermente si dice;
sibbene perchè una fortunatissima concordanza di fattori storici ed
estetici condussero il Mascagni a raggiungere nella _Cavalleria_, che è
come una prefazione fremente di entusiasmo e di fede a tutta l'opera
futura, l'intera sua capacità. Chè se egli in essa si fosse esaurito,
com'è opinione di molti, non avrebbe potuto empire le opere posteriori
di bellezze che, se per una parte riescono vane, non essendo nate a
formare un organismo compatto, per un'altra attestano che la fantasia di
quest'uomo non s'è spenta, ma aspetta solo di non essere contrariata da
soggetti che le sono alieni e indifferenti per espandersi nell'armonia
d'un capolavoro.

Analizziamo dunque questa bella e fresca prefazione.

La _Cavalleria_, a differenza delle opere successive del Mascagni nelle
quali viene usato, almeno nell'intenzione, un sistema analogo a quello
wagneriano della _melodia continua_; — dico analogo, giacchè, se il
discorso musicale del Mascagni è, come dicono oggi, continuo, la sua
concezione è per sua intima natura, opposta alla volubile fluenza del
polifonismo wagneriano — è divisa in tanti pezzi staccati secondo
l'antico sistema prewagneriano. E questo sistema dei pezzi formanti un
tutto da loro stessi, è un vero peccato sia poi stato abbandonato dal
Mascagni. Il genio latino, generalmente, non ha potente in sè, come il
tedesco, il senso dello svolgimento ininterrotto della Storia, del
divenire inarrestabile e irrivertibile delle cose. Egli ha ereditato dal
mondo ellenico la classica oggettività, il bisogno del ciclo simmetrico
della strofe, invece della prosa flessibile e asimmetrica. Così al posto
degli interminabili svolgimenti aritmici e simili al pesante e
indeterminato flusso della materia, così cari a Riccardo Wagner e ai
seguaci Riccardo Strauss e Claudio Debussy[5], egli ama le brevi forme
nitide, i contenuti ben serrati dai solidi argini del ritmo. Così le
cadenze che chiudono ogni pezzo mascagnano, sieno pure abilmente
mascherate e dissimulate, generano in noi il senso della perfezione,
poichè quei motivi e quelle melodie, che si avvolgono e si svolgono in
periodi regolari come strofi della lirica greca o degli inni sillabici
del canto gregoriano, non son fatte per essere contorte e concatenate
secondo i dogmi, a loro estranei, del sistema wagneriano o dei sistemi
da quello nati. La guerra alle cadenze che oggi infierisce nella musica,
è errata per Mascagni e starei per dire per la musica italiana; sarebbe
come fare in nome del verso aritmico dei _verslibristes_ una guerra alla
rima nella nostra poesia rimasta tuttavia a strofa ritmicamente
obbligata. E il Mascagni laddove tenta di obbedire ai canoni del
discorso libero o simile alla prosa del romanzo e della commedia in
prosa, non ha fatto che generare un malinteso puramente grafico,
malinteso che si dissipa all'audizione, se pure l'intento non sia stato
davvero raggiunto a scapito della musica stessa.

  [5] Sebbene il recitativo debussysta non sia più maestoso come
  quello wagneriano, nè di Wagner il presente dittatore della musica
  francese accetti il sistema polifonico, Debussy è forse più
  wagneriano dello stesso Strauss. Il perchè della mia affermazione
  non potrei dire in due parole. Su ciò vedi, nel giornale _La Voce_
  di Firenze, i miei tre articoli: _Claude Debussy_, _Impressionismo
  musicale_, _Ciò che ci può insegnar Beethoven_.

L'opera è preceduta da un preludio di carattere più lirico che
descrittivo sebbene d'una certa descrittività. A un breve episodio
religioso che ci avverte di essere in un giorno festivo (la Pasqua),
tracciando così un poco la cornice del quadro passionale che a poco a
poco ci vedremo svolgere dinanzi, segue un motivo che potrebbe
chiamarsi: il pianto di Santuzza; chè, infatti, esso e gli incisi che lo
seguono, son tratti dal duetto tra Santuzza e Turiddu. A questo
episodio, che subito c'immerge in quell'atmosfera di calda sensualità
disperata, caratteristica vibrante dell'anima del Mascagni, succede una
cadenza delle arpe preludiante alla _Siciliana_ — una canzone cantata a
sipario calato da Turiddu sotto le finestre di Lola. Ecco così che i
personaggi sono già evocati tutti e quasi lineati dal preludio. La
Siciliana è una melodia bellissima, serena sebbene languida di passione.
È come una stasi intima e profonda nel terribile dramma che ha già
cominciato a scatenarsi. Non è detto se sia una _mattinata_ o una
_serenata_; ma noi sentiamo in essa quella indefinibile aspirazione
quasi a superare i limiti dei corpi e gli argini delle azioni, che trema
nelle popolari canzoni d'amore, cantate nei due crepuscoli, in alcune
nostre provincie, a cui la civiltà s'è appena avvicinata. Non so se la
musica della _Siciliana_ sia originale oppur ripresa da un vero e
proprio motivo popolare. Il fatto è che Mascagni ha qui avuto una
stupenda intuizione del sentimento che doveva avere una canzone
popolare.

Ma improvvisamente l'incanto vien spezzato dal dramma feroce che
prorompe di nuovo e con maggior foga. Il fascino lascivo della canzone
vien come affogato nell'onda furiosa dell'orchestra, dove nuovi impeti
di passione balzano alternati da murmuri sordi come di collera e da echi
lontani di melodie umili come di preghiera. Finchè comincia a svolgersi
maestoso e doloroso il motivo esprimente l'urto tragico tra l'amor vano
di Santa per Turiddu e la noncuranza satura di rimorsi di quest'ultimo,
motivo a cui, dopo un fortissimo spasimante, s'attacca il pianto di
Santuzza, così pieno di disperazione rassegnata. E il preludio si chiude
con una lunga cadenza sacra che riprende e compie la cornice sacra con
cui esso si era aperto.

A proposito della descrittività di questo preludio mi si potrebbe
obbiettare che il significato che io dò ad esso può anche dipendere da
una _retroproiezione_ del significato del dramma su di esso. In altre
parole: se questo preludio fosse eseguito separatamente, esso non
potrebbe _parlarci_ di Santuzza e del suo dolore. Ma la questione è che
questo preludio non dev'essere eseguito separatamente, per la semplice
ragione che esso _è stato_ concepito insiem col dramma. Nè, parimente, è
vero che tutte le parti d'un'opera debbano, se staccate da essa, dirci
da loro sole a qual causa, per dir così, sono votate. Se la Cappella
Sistina fosse per ipotesi scancellata dal tempo di sul muro dov'è
dipinta e dalla memoria umana, colui che ne venisse a scoprire un
frammento, ad es: una delle Sibille, si troverebbe, credo,
ben'imbrogliato a ricostruire il tutto, risalendo ad esso da quella
parte frammentaria. Lo stesso si dica di uno dei frammenti scampati al
naufragio del teatro greco. Una frase, un motivo, una figura prendono il
loro significato dal testo al quale sono concreate. È il tutto che dà il
valore delle parti, o, meglio, è l'intuizione, per dir così, centrale,
che s'è espanta armoniosamente nelle più estreme ramificazioni del
tutto. Le parole, le frasi, i periodi; le note, gli accordi, i motivi,
gli svolgimenti, etc. etc., non sono che forme del linguaggio, il quale
è composto di simboli vuoti e, per dir così, non solo empibili di sempre
mutevole contenuto, ma trasportabili in quella di tutte le posizioni
rispetto al tutto, che possa contribuire maggiormente a raggiungere
l'intuizione madre, a esprimerne la vita, almeno approssimativamente.
L'essere scettici riguardo alla descrittività della musica, o meglio al
suo valore determinativo, è essere scettici del potere rappresentativo
del linguaggio umano; e se tale scetticismo spesso non ha luogo di
esercitarsi sul linguaggio parlato, ciò dipende dalla lunga abitudine,
che ha soffocato lo stupore del miracolo.

Il sipario si alza davanti alla piazzetta d'un paese in festa. È
mattina. Le campane suonano e dal loro ritmo vien generato, con
un'intuizione geniale, il motivo gaio e esuberante di trilli di colore e
di squilli di luce, che descrive la pasqua. Son frasi gaie, lanciate con
un brio rossiniano di danza, alle quali si unisce a poco a poco il
doppio coro, quello femminile cantante una fresca e delicata melodia
primaverile, quello maschile, rude, un po' sgarbato nella sua allegria
contadinesca. La scena è indovinatissima. Potrà forse sembrare triviale
a certi critici di palato ipersensibile, ma chi conosce bene le pasque
gioconde delle nostre città italiane col loro bel sole d'aprile, con
quel brulichio d'abiti femminili dai colori accesi che formano colle
luci e con le ombre accordi policromi sempre cangianti; chi ha provato
quel senso tutto caratteristico di allegria spensierata e di facile
felicità che effondono lo scampanio incessante e il clamore della folla,
diverso, non so perchè, da quello delle altre domeniche, riconoscerà che
Pietro Mascagni ha mirabilmente rappresentato in questa scena
introduttiva il mattino della pasqua popolare italiana.

E il dramma comincia.

Un motivo tortuoso e cupo, il motivo della gelosia di Santa, apre il
recitativo di questa con mamma Lucia. Fermiamoci un istante su questo
tipo di recitativo. Esso non è il vecchio recitativo monotono dell'opera
buffa, o il recitativo eroico e starei per dire marmoreo delle opere
wagneriane della prima e seconda maniera. Neppur si riattacca al
melanconico e sentimentale recitativo del 500-600. Deriva, se mai, dal
recitativo bizettiano (da quello per es., dell'ultima scena della
_Carmen_, chè i veri _recitativi secchi_ di quest'opera non furono
scritti dal Bizet, come ognun sa, ma dal suo amico Guiraud), recitativo
drammatico, duttile, pieghevole a esprimere con naturalezza i più
diversi sentimenti. Ma, in realtà, è una specie di recitativo nuovo,
anzi più un _canto libero_ ogni tanto solcato da esclamazioni liriche
dell'orchestra, che un vero e proprio recitativo. In opere posteriori il
Mascagni ha pur troppo tentato di abbandonare questo suo bel tipo di
recitativo per riprendere anch'egli il recitativo svenevole e civettuolo
della scuola massenettiana. Ma non avendo il Mascagni le pessime doti di
leggerezza melliflua che ci vogliono per parlar musicalmente con tale
leziosaggine melensa, ne è venuto fuori un linguaggio ibrido, che non
contenta nessuno con la sua goffaggine provinciale, che vuol sembrare
disinvoltura da _viveur_.

La canzone di Alfio, che segue l'incontro delle due donne, è uno dei
pezzi più scadenti dell'opera. In esso appare, la prima volta in
Mascagni, il vizio dell'enfatica eloquenza inutile, vizio inoculato
nella musica moderna dal dittatore a vita di essa musica: Riccardo
Wagner. Lo spunto della canzone, un triviale motivuccio da operetta, è
scelto arbitrariamente dall'autore a reggere un grandioso edificio
corale e strumentale di nessun valore musicale, salvo che musica non
diventi sinonimo di fragore. L'origine di questo vizio va ricercata,
come ho detto, nello smodato fervore con cui finora è stato studiato il
sistema d'orchestrazione wagneriano. Il Wagner, scopritore di
meravigliosi e impreveduti impasti strumentali, lasciò pur troppo una
specie di ricetta, usando la quale i musicisti sono pressochè sicuri di
ottenere un frenetico applauso. Comunque questo pezzo, che sembra
descriva il fragore di rotolanti carri guerreschi e non l'umile
treppichio dei poveri barrocci siciliani, ha pur nel disegno errato
qualcosa di fresco e di giovanile che fa pensare a certi selvaggi e un
po' triviali ritmi tschaikowskyani. Quasi a fare il _pendant_ a questo
coro segue l'inno popolare della resurrezione. Anche questo pezzo è
condotto con un po' di tronfiezza ed esagerazione. Ma la spontaneità
della melodia, l'impeto delle modulazioni, alcuni effetti irresistibili
di sonorità, vibranti quasi d'un empito di gioventù e di passione,
finiscono per far perdonare il fragore, pur questa volta sproporzionato
a un'azione che esigerebbe maggior semplicità e forse un tono tra
l'agreste e il pastorale; insomma un canto più umile e meno
meyerbeeriano nella condotta.

Ma ecco due scene in cui il Mascagni può abbandonarsi tutto al suo
frenetico lirismo erotico. Il racconto che Santuzza fa del tradimento di
Turiddu, e il duetto tra questi e Santuzza, interrotto per un istante da
una breve entrata di Lola, un po' curiosa a dire il vero. Giacchè donne
che vadano alla messa per una piazza pubblica cantando a squarciagola
stornelli d'amore, sono, anche sul teatro melodrammatico, e con buona
pace dei librettisti, inverosimili. Infatti i librettisti italiani
sembrano un po' troppo convinti che l'arte, sia lirica, sia drammatica,
è immagine, sì del reale, ma del reale trasformazione fantastica. In
fondo in fondo, sotto la libertà dell'arte, si trova — la schiavitù
della scena. E questo mi si conceda che è alquanto ridicolo trattandosi
specialmente di un dramma... veristico. O la bella e schietta
verisimiglianza della novella del Verga! Ad ogni modo queste due scene
sono tra le parti più belle dell'opera; onde occupiamoci sopratutto del
carattere personalissimo di questa musica. Ho già detto altrove che il
Mascagni sente più di ogni altro sentimento l'amor sensuale e un po'
brutale del popolo; questi due pezzi ne sono una conferma lampante. Il
primo di essi, la romanza di Santuzza, narra il dolore della giovinetta
tradita, il ribrezzo della sua carne martoriata dalle immagini del
desiderio e della gelosia, sempre rinascenti come un incubo
infaticabile. La musica si colora mirabilmente delle immagini poetiche
espresse dalle parole, anzi sembra essere di queste immagini
narrative-verbali quella confusa frangia di nuove immagini e sentimenti
che suole circondare come un alone sfumato e inafferrabile l'immagine
centrale di una poesia. Già l'introduzione orchestrale simile alle
iniziali miniate, con cui, nei libri antichi, si preludiava
pittoricamente alla narrazione di poi scritta, ci fa entrare nella
pienezza della situazione. Il pudore e lo spasimo carnale, che
impediscono alla giovinetta di parlare; la rassegnazione al destino,
sotto la quale però cova l'odio mortale alla donna che ha sedotto
Turiddu, per invidia a lei, Santuzza, non per vero amore a Turiddu;
tutte queste fluttuazioni di passioni tra di loro intrecciate e
contrastanti, e di cui la potenza sta per prorompere nella povera
fanciulla con un'intensità tutta propria dell'anime popolari più
istintive che riflessive; sono bene espresse in quei due _versi_ di
melodia[6] dolorosa, coronati da uno scoppio passionale e conclusi
dall'abbattimento d'una cadenza rallentante. La melodia del racconto
quindi segue e sottolinea con perfetta evidenza _sentimentale_, non
_visiva_, come fa, per es., Wagner, gli episodi dell'agitata narrazione
della popolana. Di questi episodi belli in particolar modo sono e quello
in cui vien narrato il nuovo ravvicinamento di Turiddu e Lola, e quello
in cui si confessa l'atroce verità con tutta la confusione della
vergogna e la rivolta dell'amore tradito:

    _priva dell'onor mio rimango!_

La melodia di queste parole sembra sgorgare lenta e desolata dal tumulto
incalzante di poc'anzi. È uno di quei rari momenti di _melodia
assoluta_, che corrisponde, nell'arte, a quello che, nella vita, è lo
sfogo del pianto. E, infatti, come nella vita una tensione troppo forte
e troppo lunga dei nostri nervi nella sofferenza, ci condurrebbe a
qualche disequilibrio irrimediabile, onde il risolvimento della crisi
nel pianto ci procura un benessere doloroso sì ma consolatore; così, in
arte, il modo stilistico che corrisponde al momento del pianto o di un
qualunque sfogo in generale, ha come un potere refrigerante e
sollevatore. Si ricordi nel _Coriolano_ di Beethoven, dopo il furioso
battito del ritmo affannoso che apre il pezzo, lo sgorgo discendente
della sublime melodia _cantabile_, e si ricordi ancora nell'ode a
Napoleone Eugenio di Giosuè Carducci, il refrigerio indimenticabile che
dà, dopo tanto cupo rombo di gloria fatale, l'evocazione della solitaria
«casa d'Aiaccio — cui verdi e grandi le quercie ombreggiano — e i poggi
coronan sereni — e davanti le risuona il mare!».

  [6] Sono obbligato, in mancanza d'un linguaggio più preciso, a
  chiedere in prestito i vocaboli alla metrica della poesia, del
  resto non certo estranea alla metrica della musica ancora anonima.

Un episodio religioso, lo stesso con cui comincia l'opera, cioè il
motivo pasquale, termina la bellissima romanza.

Il duetto che la segue è di pari bellezza. Il dialogo, condotto sopra il
recitativo mascagnano del quale ho già rilevato l'originalità, è, a
parer mio, perfetto. Le due persone del popolo, che vi son dipinte in un
momento così tragico della loro vita, son rese all'evidenza in tutte le
pieghe vorticose delle loro ingenue passioni. A una esecuzione, per aver
un'idea della verità popolare di questo duetto, se ne osservi il
riflesso sui volti degli uditori delle platee e dei loggioni. È un
continuo cangiamento del giuoco delle fisonomie, che al fremito doloroso
d'un accordo si abbuiano, si rischiarano a una dolcezza melodica,
s'increspano con i suoni aspri di un'ironia di Santuzza. Giacchè la
potenza ingenua d'espressione di questa musica è inesauribile, e, sotto
quest'aspetto, il breve terzetto a recitativo tra Santuzza Turiddu e
Lola, è un piccolo gioiello. Le movenze vivacissime del dialogo, i
fuggevoli incisi orchestrali, la naturalezza degli _enjambements_
dell'una parte sull'altra, ci fanno quasi credere di esser in mezzo alla
via d'un sobborgo popolare, dove alcune querule comari, coi pugni sui
fianchi, si bisticcino fortemente, non risparmiando d'offendersi sia pur
con l'inflessione della voce, e riconducendo così il linguaggio a una
vera e propria musica, a quella lirica vivezza d'espressione, la quale
il nostro sfiorito linguaggio di uomini beneducati e beneammaestrati ha
da gran tempo perduto.

Lola partita, il duetto riprende con maggior furore. La vena lirica del
Mascagni si riapre, versa torrenti di melodia. Sono in particolare belle
la melodia sulle parole: _no, no, Turiddu, rimani ancora_, e quella: _la
tua Santuzza piange e t'implora_, ambedue già fatte udire nel preludio.
Le diverse sfumature del dolore di Santuzza e del rimorso orgoglioso di
Turiddu, vi sono espresse come meglio non si poteva. Caratteristici sono
i furori (è la vera parola) melodici, allorchè le voci salgono a una
altezza disperata, vibrando in un fortissimo passionale di tutta la
massa orchestrale. Questi abbandoni frenetici al fortissimo furono da me
già osservati, a proposito della preghiera, come una delle principali
caratteristiche dell'esuberante e prepotente natura musicale del
Mascagni. Naturalmente nessuna attitudine, come questa, alla retorica
può esser pericolosa e trascinare nel vuoto e nel volgare; però la
freschezza giovanile con cui il Mascagni compose la _Cavalleria_,
difende assai questo spartito dal pericolo suddetto. Il duetto, dopo
aver percorse diverse fasi tutte interessanti, s'arresta ad un tratto su
di un tremolo dei bassi, al quale si mischiano soffocate ed irose le
offese supreme dei due fidanzati. Momento indovinato, in cui il canto e
la parola, insomma l'intuizione del proprio stato di anima, cessa per
dar luogo al suono rauco e quasi bestiale dell'ira cieca. L'ira infatti,
al suo estremo furore, estingue ogni rappresentazione lucida; l'uomo non
vede più che in confuso; il turbine della passione scatenata lo
disumana, lo fa tornare natura, sentimento incosciente.

E questo è bene espresso dal Mascagni con i tremuli sordi, colla
precipitosa e starei per dire verdiana scala cromatica saliente, quasi a
condurre alle labbra di Santuzza la maledizione folle: _a te la mala
pasqua, spergiuro!_ E l'orchestra commenta, intonando a tutta forza il
motivo della gelosia di Santa.

Anche questa dei commenti orchestrali alla fine d'un pezzo è
caratteristica mascagnana. Alla fine del duo dell'_Amico Fritz_ (soprano
e tenore atto III); alla fine dell'ultima scena del I atto dell'_Iris_,
alla fine del duello tra Ratcliff e Douglas nel III atto del _Guglielmo
Ratcliff_ e in molte altre parti dell'opera mascagnana, si trovano
esempi di questi commenti orchestrali, i quali hanno avuta eccessiva
fortuna nella giovane scuola italiana e in modo speciale sono stati
ripresi con grande eleganza dal maestro Perosi.

Il duetto che segue, e cioè, il duetto tra Santuzza e Alfio, è
infinitamente inferiore al duetto precedente. C'è in esso una fiacchezza
fantastica invano celata dai tentativi numerosi d'abbandono a una
melodia che non vuole espandersi. La composizione, anche negli artisti
più leggeri e più spontanei, è pur sempre qualcosa di troppo sacro,
perchè la si possa comandare a piacere. La fretta del preparare l'opera
per il concorso, l'impazienza irriverente (e tutta italiana, pur troppo)
davanti al mistero della creazione, irriverente impazienza propria a
molti nostri altri musicisti, ad es: al Rossini; e altre simili ragioni
d'indole pratica hanno impedito al Mascagni di attendere il momento
propizio per risolvere il problema estetico di questo duetto con
l'_unica_ risoluzione che gli spettava, o per migliorarne la risoluzione
già sbagliata. Così com'è, è un pezzo ben meschino, vuoto, tirato via,
con una velleità di ritorno all'antico modo di cadenzare un pezzo con
qualche retorica cadenza o nota di bravura.

Possiamo anzi fin da ora notare, e così avremo indicati i principali
difetti dell'arte mascagnana, che il nostro autore, se ha in comune con
gli artisti molto spontanei ed ingenui alcuni pregi indiscutibili, ne ha
anche in comune i difetti correlativi. Se, per es., è nel Mascagni
pregio gettar giù musica bella (sebben piccola nel suo contenuto) a
larghi fiotti, come una fontana sempre piena, senza l'ansia creatrice e
il combattimento eroico con la materia sorda e riluttante alla bellezza
della forma, procedimenti propri a un Michelangiolo e a un Beethoven;
talvolta questa sua facilità quasi direi incosciente, tanto è ingenua,
diviene il suo peggior difetto. Che l'accogliere senza un'insaziabile
riflessione tutto ciò che nasce nella sua fantasia, lo porta spesso a
accumulare erbe marcite in luogo di fiori freschissimi. Nel resto
dell'opera del Mascagni infatti, e lo vedremo a suo luogo, vi sono non
più pezzi soli e brevi, ma interi spartiti, in cui la mancanza d'una
vagliatura rigorosa e dignitosa ha fatto sì che il maestro scambiasse
per arie espressive, semplici accozzi mnemonici ed insignificanti di
quegli echi di composizioni o proprie o altrui, che formano il supplizio
di tutti i musicisti più riflessi. Giacchè anche nella musica accade ciò
che il Bergson e altri notavano accadere nel linguaggio poetico. I
poeti, i veri poeti, creano parole sempre nuove, perchè intuiscono
sempre situazioni della realtà continuamente diverse; ma la vita comune,
la vita, come direbbe lo Shelley, _meccanica_, non avendo creatività
bastante a produrre nuove esperienze, ripete, con esperienze
stereotipate, parole vecchie, da cui è stata spremuta tutta la
freschezza del succo. I nuovi musicisti, parimente, creano formule
tonali nuove; i retori si affrettano a ripeterle, a ripeterle fino a che
il pubblico d'orecchi duri non se ne stufi e protesti fischiando. E per
retori intendo anche coloro che, pur avendo creato della musica nuova,
cioè avendo creato delle formule nuove per problemi estetici
irripetibili, tentano di applicarle a problemi estetici nuovi, divenendo
così _autoretori_. Il Mascagni è uno di questi. Egli nella creazione ha
una facilità estrema, che ricorda, sotto questo aspetto, la facilità,
quasi sorella dell'improvvisazione, di Victor Hugo. E come questi, egli
ha sopra di sè, simile a una condanna, la minaccia dell'autoretorica,
che pare quasi vendicare gli artisti incontentabili, come il Beethoven,
di questa specie d'ingiustizia della natura. Per questo aspetto è pieno
di significato la mesta invidia che Beethoven provava, vedendosi
abbandonato dal leggero e vano pubblico viennese per il gaio e
spensierato Rossini.

L'intermezzo che divide l'opera in due parti diseguali è composto d'una
specie di brevi strofi preludianti, e di una larga melodia ormai, e
giustamente, famosa. Le due strofi sono di stile religioso, ma di una
religiosità calda e sensuale che ci ricorda certe frasi della musica
religiosa del Pergolese. Vi piange infatti la stessa melodiosa
malinconia erotica del buon settecento napoletano, e queste due eleganti
strofi, per essere religiose non cessano d'avere un aggraziato movimento
di menuetto leggiadro. È curiosa anzi l'osservazione che oggi si
potrebbe fare a tanta musica moderna da Wagner in giù: la confusione di
tutti gli stili, o per meglio dire, l'uso profano di certe formule
stilistiche in altri tempi adoprate con intenzione religiosa, o,
viceversa, l'uso oggi religioso di formule in tempo lontanissimo
profane. La musica religiosa del 700 ripresa dagli autori moderni,
assume una significazione per lo più erotica. È una profanazione, nel
cattivo senso della parola? o è il tardivo atto di giustizia, per cui
vien svelato che quelle formulette erano molto più terrene che
celestiali?

La larga melodia dei violini che forma la seconda parte dell'intermezzo,
accompagnata internamente dall'organo, dimostra una volta di più la
verità di quanto ho detto nell'introduzione, che la melodia mascagnana
per essere esulata dalle gole umane nei meccanismi degli strumenti
orchestrali, è pur sempre rimasta la vecchia melodia italiana,
ultracantabile. E della vecchia melodia italiana ha tutto il fascino
sensuale questa magnifica melodia d'una calda religiosità quasi erotica.
Religiosità erotica, ho detto. Infatti qui non starò a dimostrare
diffusamente come il sentimento religioso del Mascagni non cessi d'esser
religioso per essere sensuale. Al sentimento religioso, come a tutti i
sentimenti, non possiamo dar forme determinate ed esclusive, giacchè le
sue concretizzazioni è naturale che si colorino delle infinite
differenze che distinguono tra di loro le personalità artistiche. Così
la religiosità d'un Michelangiolo è eroica, quella d'un Wagner mistica,
quella ancora di un Pergolese sensuale quanto quella del Mascagni. E
nella Bibbia lo stesso Dio del mito ebraico è come modificato dalla
diversità dei caratteri dei profeti che lo cantano.

Ma la messa è terminata. Le campane squillano di nuovo «con onde e
volate di suoni». La scena si riempie di popolo, che canta nella gran
luce del mattino inoltrato, un coro allegro e leggero. Non ripeterò la
difesa alla banalità squillante e argentina di questa scena popolare. Nè
difenderò la gaiezza sprizzante e saltellante del brindisi. Giacchè chi
non sente la bellezza di questa scena e di questo brindisi, non ha mai
bevuto e ammirato sotto le pergole appena verzicanti dai tralci che
rimettono, in certe graziose trattorie di campagna, il luccicore rosso
del vino coronato di spuma rosea, al sole di primavera. In fondo in
fondo i critici dovrebbero avere una possibilità quasi infinita di
esperienze, che dovrebbero risorgere alla voce suggeritrice e
rievocatrice dell'arte. Ma questa possibilità è troppo rara, perchè noi
ci rassegnamo a sentire malmenare della musica anche bella, da critici
troppo limitati e accecati da pregiudizi micidiali.

Alla interruzione dell'intermezzo e della bella scena popolare, succede
più tragica e più feroce l'ultima ripresa del dramma. E il finale è
perfetto in tutte le sue parti. Dalla sfida di Alfio al discorso
sconclusionato di Turiddu, che sente in sè sorgere prepotente il rimorso
per il male che ha fatto a Santuzza; dall'addio di Turiddu alla madre,
d'una dolcezza che strazia, al murmure lontano del popolo che annuncia
tumultuosamente l'uccisione di Turiddu; è un seguito di episodi che
fanno uguagliare a questo finale la bellezza della romanza e del duetto
di Santa e di Turiddu. Ma di tutti questi episodi, l'addio di Turiddu
alla madre è forse tale da superare la bellezza non solo del resto del
finale, ma ancora di tutta l'opera. Dopo la sfida di Alfio, la scena è
rimasta vuota. Alla gaiezza e al clamore è successo un silenzio
impicciato e quasi doloroso, quel senso di tristezza che generano le
scenate popolari in mezzo a una bella festa. Tutti sono partiti
lasciando Turiddu solo nella gran piazza piena di sole. È un momento
d'ineffabile malinconia. Turiddu non sa come baciare, forse per l'ultima
volta, la madre. E un breve intermezzo di violini tremolanti nel grande
silenzio, s'espande rinforzando scendendo salendo diminuendo, come fa il
vento, e come fanno i sentimenti umani fluttuando per i lor ciechi e
irremeabili labirinti. Finchè Turiddu trova la scusa: ha bevuto troppo,
ha bisogno di un poco d'aria libera; e fingendosi ubbriaco chiede alla
madre la benedizione «come quel giorno che partì soldato». Questa frase
è un nulla: eppure è un'evocazione sublime. Bisogna infatti sapere che
cosa significhi per gli abitanti dei paesetti sperduti e lontani dai
grandi centri la leva militare, quella ineluttabile chiamata che strappa
alle madri e ai padri i figli per portarli, là, nelle contrade ignorate
o sognate come piene di terribili pericoli, donde spesso non tornano
più; bisogna intendere tutta la delicatezza di quell'immagine
infinitamente triste. E nella musica c'è tanta semplicità, tanta
giustezza di malinconia affettuosa, che volentieri noi porremmo questa
scena tra le più grandi d'ogni teatro. Ma alla pietà filiale s'accoppia
in Turiddu la compassione per Santuzza: ed egli prorompe allora in una
spasimante frase: «Voi dovrete fare da madre a Santa!» La povera madre
s'angustia; domanda il perchè di tali strane parole e del più strano
tono. E tuttavia la musica non ha un momento di debolezza: è sempre
d'una _verità_ purissima, cristallina. Nessun ricordo di _maniera_
intralcia nello spirito del musicista lo svolgersi della visione del
dramma, sentito fino a farlo balzare ai nostri occhi e al nostro cuore
come un momento di vera vita vissuta. Questa musica è perfetta
creazione, e le parole e la situazione per esser rivissute intere nello
spirito del Mascagni, sembrano esser create contemporaneamente colla
musica. Anzi io posso sostituire all'empirico _forse_, una sicurezza
assoluta. Giacchè in iscene come queste, anche i compositori che non
creano nel tempo storico il libretto da loro stessi, ma lo chiedono ad
altri, sono simili a coloro che, come Wagner, furono autori del libretto
della musica. Infatti tanto gli uni che gli altri, creando l'opera
musicale, dovettero rifondere in una nuova intuizione _totale_, l'antica
intuizione poetica. Onde, che questa appartenesse ad un altro o a
quell'altro particolar sè stesso, che è il _sè_ del passato, ciò non
conta, se tutte e due le intuizioni, e la propria e l'altrui, debbono
essere rintuite e come rifuse in una sola dal compositore.

Riepilogando, la _Cavalleria Rusticana_ è opera non di grande portata,
ma schietta e piena di vita e di difetti simpatici da un capo all'altro.
È un'opera giovane ed entusiastica; è un'opera plebea, certo inadeguata
a rappresentare nella storia un vero e proprio momento spirituale
dell'Italia. Piuttosto essa si riallaccia bene con quell'ordine di opere
italiane e straniere, create, com'ebbe a dire uno degli interpreti più
profondi dello spirito moderno, da coloro che, preclusi ai grandi
orizzonti del pensiero dall'opaca muraglia del positivismo e del
naturalismo, peccarono contro il pensiero. Se non che la posizione del
Mascagni nel verismo e nel naturalismo è assai più complessa di quella
di uno Zola e di Verga e merita di essere commentata ed esplicata, tanto
più che da tale analisi potremo togliere i criteri onde dare un
definitivo giudizio su quest'opera; un giudizio, cioè, che non
annullando come, ripeto, troppi critici fanno, le sue indiscutibili
bellezze, limiti la sfera in cui queste bellezze nacquero e vivono.

La _Cavalleria_ si ricollega indubbiamente col grande movimento europeo
del verismo. Senza entrare nella questione, per me ovvia, della
possibilità del verismo nella musica, noterò subito come la _Cavalleria_
sia opera del verismo più per virtù del libretto, che per bisogno della
natura del musicista. È in questo che consiste la speciale posizione del
Mascagni rispetto al verismo. La musica è stata finora, riguardo ai
grandi movimenti della coltura europea e alle grandi correnti dell'arte,
come un'arte _di rifiuto_. Le aspirazioni d'una nuova scuola allora solo
penetrano nel mondo cinese dei musicisti, che abbiano compiuta la loro
totale evoluzione e che questa evoluzione abbia già generato la sua
rispettiva controrivoluzione. L'Italia aveva avuto già la violenta e
feconda reazione letteraria al verismo zoliano e verghiano nello
pseudo-idealismo d'annunziano, pseudo in quanto attuato più come
intenzione che come cosciente rivolta al positivismo; quando la reazione
dei musicisti al melodramma victorughiano-verdiano si modellava
tardivamente sopra la reazione che all'arte victorughiano-romantica già
compivano in Francia i naturalisti, generando un'arte che doveva empire
di nuovo sangue, benchè a preferenza plebeo, le vene flaccide della Musa
Europea. La _Cavalleria_ resulta dunque, rispetto agli ideali che
l'hanno o sembra l'abbiano ispirata, un'opera in ritardo, e perciò,
anche sotto quest'aspetto, inferiore alla storia, allo spirito che si
svolge con continuo processo di autocreazione nel tempo; essa è
un'estrema produzione del verismo, come il _Mefistofele_ è una postrema
produzione del romanticismo; sebbene nella _Cavalleria_ noi potremmo
trovare un verismo infinitamente meno rigoroso di quello dei
naturalisti, che non ammettevano l'opera d'arte che come un documento
scientifico-fotografico della vita umana. E non per il fatto che il
Mascagni si sia reso piena coscienza dell'errore estetico del verismo;
sibbene perchè il verismo mascagnano è un verismo da musicisti, un
verismo (non voglio fare un _calembour_) a orecchio, da permettere
perfino delle infiltrazioni wagneriane. Ora questa mia nota sul verismo
della _Cavalleria_, non sarebbe che oziosa e meramente meccanica, se
proprio questo carattere veristico non facesse assumere a quest'opera il
valore, rispetto alla circoscritta operistica italiana, d'un sintomo di
rinnovamento innegabilmente necessario, e, rispetto alla grande arte
motivata dalle più alte necessità della storia umana, non le facesse
assumere, contemporaneamente, il valore d'un'opera inutile perchè in
ritardo[7]. Ciò che ho detto sulla manchevole coltura del Mascagni, ha
qui una nuova riprova. Sembra quasi che l'arte degli artisti come questo
nostro, si contenga verso la grande arte degli artisti come Goethe e
Beethoven, e Berlioz e Wagner, al modo stesso che l'immobile fondo del
mare verso gli alti strati delle acque percorse da correnti e agitate da
tempeste. Il movimento delle onde giunge, se vi giunge, in basso, quando
già su in alto un nuovo movimento s'è manifestato. L'ambiente musicale
assolutamente sterile di nuove idee, nate dal contatto diretto della
vita libera e aereata dai vasti venti della coltura, si pasce quasi
delle briciole che lascia cadere il sereno banchetto dei grandi spiriti.
Da questa specie di vecchiaia precoce, di morte quasi direi necessaria e
congenita alla nascita dell'opera, viene spiegato il senso di vuoto che
cova sotto la _Cavalleria_. Certo la freschezza dello spirito del
Mascagni c'incanta, e se noi giungiamo ad astrarre l'opera dal momento
storico in cui siamo immersi, e ad assorbirci tutti nell'angusto cerchio
della vita dello spirito italiano, quasi ci sentiamo spinti a proclamare
la _Cavalleria_ un capolavoro. Ma anche ammettendo, come io so di buon
grado, la fresca spontaneità di quest'opera contrastante con le
bolse produzioni del falsissimo teatro melodrammatico italiano —
un teatro che ci ha dato talora per buone delle putrefazioni
romantico-sentimentalistiche della forza d'una _Gioconda_ del Ponchielli
— il nostro spirito, se aperto a tutti i venti che agitano la storia
contemporanea e alle voci dei suoi problemi spirituali, trova presto in
quella freschezza la barriera della puerilità e dell'incoscienza, e in
quella spontaneità — il limite cieco della futilità. Non siamo dinanzi a
una di quelle opere che c'inquietano e ci fecondano, se non altro di
contraddizioni, come qualche libro di Zola un tempo, e come il _Pelléas_
di Debussy, oggi. Non sentiamo nella _Cavalleria_ un bisogno
ineluttabilmente nuovo, che prenda coscienza piena di sè e, come tale,
abbia il diritto di esser chiamato una nuova conoscenza artistica, una
vera nuova opera d'arte. La _Cavalleria_, se, ripeto, siamo pienamente
coscienti del nostro spirito, ci fa l'effetto che fanno tutti i ritardi
e le rifioriture fuori stagione nella storia. Stucca presto, anzi genera
presto, invece di uno stato estetico nuovo, un sorriso oblioso. Oblioso,
perchè ci _dimentichiamo_ che è stata scritta, tosto che il grande sole
della vera coltura adeguata alla pienezza cosciente dello spirito, ci
ravvolge scaldandoci e illuminandoci del suo immenso splendore
meridiano.

  [7] Lo stesso si potrebbe dire, mutatis mutandis, del
  _Mefistofele_ di Arrigo Boito.

Così, tutto sommato e tenendo conto del valore di musicista popolare che
ha il Mascagni, il vero senso che la _Cavalleria_ ha nella storia
generale dell'arte e quindi dello spirito umano, non è che quello
d'indicare un rinnovamento popolare della linfa musicale
nell'antichissimo tronco dell'arte italiana. E anche questo suo valore
popolare non è da disprezzarsi. Giacchè si ricordi bene che il popolo è
pur sempre il serbatoio delle forze vive d'una nazione, e che coloro i
quali sembrano aver superato lo stato confuso e retorico della vita
spirituale del popolo, in fondo in fondo non hanno fatto altro che dare
una forma _umana_ a ciò che dall'anima popolare veniva su come confuso
gurgite di sentimenti. Ond'è che un vero grande musicista futuro non
potrà dimenticarsi dell'opera di Pietro Mascagni, come non potrà
dimenticarsi, pur riallacciandosi alla grande tradizione del 500-600, di
quelle di Verdi di Bellini e degli altri nostri compositori popolari.
Riprendo qui una tesi che accennai nella prima parte di questo studio.
Il linguaggio musicale italiano è continuato da quei sebben piccoli
musicisti che, sotto altro aspetto, giustamente noi reputiamo come
imbastarditori della grande arte italiana. Ma chi vorrà cantare
italianamente dovrà avere le vecchie arie popolari in cuore. Che certo
queste meno differiscono dalle antichissime nenie dei pastori preromani,
di quello che da esse non differiscano, e comicamente, le musiche
inutili degli intedescati e dei futuri d'Indysti e Debussysti.




II.

L'Amico Fritz e i Rantzau.


Che il buon Mascagni non fosse un verista pienamente iniziato nei dogmi
della scuola naturalistica, ce lo dimostrano le due opere, che subito
seguirono la _Cavalleria_. La prima di esse, l'_Amico Fritz_, sebben
musicalmente possa rappresentare come la continuazione del giovanile
furore melodico della _Cavalleria_, non ne rappresenta certo una
continuazione dei presunti ideali veristici. Non starò a ripetere che
quel verismo era dato alla _Cavalleria_ dal caso puro e semplice; chè
infatti il soggetto del _Fritz_ ne è una conferma lampante, nulla
essendo di più d'una di quelle farse un po' comiche un po' sentimentali,
quali il Donizzetti specialmente ci diede nel suo delizioso _Elisir
d'amore_ e nel suo _Don Pasquale_, etc. Certo molto di nuovo e di
diverso dal contenuto di quelle farse e delle affini c'è nel _Fritz_;
chè elementi indubitatamente nuovi sono nella vita anche popolare della
terza Italia. Un senso più immediato e appassionato della natura, una
più profonda, a modo suo, intimità psicologica dei personaggi, e quella
certa strana tristezza erotica, che se per un lato richiama alla memoria
l'erotismo melanconico del settecento, per un altro è cosa tutta moderna
e che, a ben guardare, si ricollega con quello stato ambiguo che fu
chiamato — dai letterati, oh! non dai musicisti — _neoromanticismo_. Ma
nella sostanza il drammetto del _Fritz_ è ben diverso nel suo
significato umano dalla tragedia della _Cavalleria_. Col _Fritz_ il
Mascagni è tornato, per non abbandonarli più, ai vecchi _mannequins_ del
teatro melodrammatico italiano. Questi personaggi non son mai come
quelli della _Cavalleria_. Tra Suzel e Santuzza c'è lo stesso abisso che
tra la vera poesia e la graziosa invenzione del romanzo ameno.

Musicalmente, ripeto, il _Fritz_ è una continuazione dell'esplosività
melodica della giovinezza musicale del Mascagni. Come noi vedremo a poco
a poco, la scoperta della propria forma musicale dal Mascagni raggiunta
nella _Cavalleria_, lo influenzò per il lungo periodo che va dalla
_Cavalleria_ all'_Iris_, nel quale spartito egli raggiunge la scoperta
di un mondo di nuove formule stilistiche, quasi direi di un nuovo
vocabolario personale, scoperta pur troppo resa vana, come è già
dimostrato in altra parte, dal non essere generata di pari passo con la
scoperta d'un nuovo contenuto maggiormente significativo. Pure tra il
_Fritz_ e le opere al _Fritz_ posteriori, cioè i _Rantzau_, il _Poema
leopardiano_ e il _Silvano_ (eccettuo il _Ratcliff_ e lo _Zanetto_ come
opere, in cui il maestro ha potuto risentire con calore di vita
l'espressione di quelle formule già sfruttate) corre un immenso divario:
chè, rispetto alla pienezza espressiva della _Cavalleria_, quelle tre
opere sono autoretorica nata dalla _Cavalleria_, mentre il _Fritz_ è,
come ho già detto, una continuazione della _Cavalleria_. Quindi, a parte
la sciatteria di alcune sue parti, nel _Fritz_ troviamo ancora delle
cose incantevoli per freschezza e schiettezza. Il preludietto, l'aria di
Suzel nel 1º atto, quasi tutto il 2º atto, la magnifica romanza
«all'amore» di Fritz nel terzo atto e, pure nel terzo, il duo di Fritz
con Suzel, meraviglioso per passione e forza drammatica, son tutti pezzi
degni di stare accanto alle più belle ispirazioni della _Cavalleria_. Ma
il pezzo che supera e abbuia tutta l'opera e che è tra le cose migliori
del Mascagni, sebbene inutile rispetto all'opera in cui lo troviamo, è
l'intermezzo. Consistente come quello della _Cavalleria_ in una larga
aria per violini incastonata tra accordi preludianti e accordi
concludenti orchestrali, questo intermezzo esprime, quanto difficilmente
la musica del Mascagni ha poi saputo ancora esprimerlo, la calda natura
sensuale dell'autore. A quei critici a cui non piaccia e che non sentano
in esso che un volgare raddoppio di violini, io non so fare altro che
consigliare di essere inesauribili nelle loro esperienze di vita e
d'arte, e di pensare che anche questa sensualità espansiva e sana, in
cui par sentire «gorgogliar rosse le scaturigini della vita», è cosa
troppo italiana, troppo popolare, troppo giovane, perchè si possa
spiegare... a chi non l'ha provata nè sospettata, e a chi non ha
dell'Italia che una concezione retorico-nietzschiana. Ma chi ha
conosciuto la semplicità della vita italiana lungo i litorali luminosi,
nelle campagne armoniose di venti leggeri e di squilli di merli; chi ha
penetrato il fascino carnale dei dialetti di certe sue città
meridionali, dialetti che nelle loro movenze sembrano musica di Mascagni
o di Bellini; chi dell'Italia sa tutto questo e ha intravisto
(sorridendo dell'avvicinamento mostruoso) quanta parentela corra tra la
più fresca e schietta poesia di un Gabriele D'Annunzio (_Canto novo_,
_III libro delle Laudi_) e le dolci liriche di un Salvatore di Giacomo,
e ha sospettato che le loro parole vivide di meridionalità sono
intagliate nella stessa materia psichica di questi buoni musicisti
italiani, che sembrano averci al posto dell'anima... della bella carne
giovane e robusta; converrà con me che quest'intermezzo è vero, è bello,
è italiano, e che anch'esso va messo tra quelle arie popolari, che il
sereno grande compositore futuro dell'Italia dovrà avere nel cuore
insieme con qualche altra cosa ancora degl'italiani, oggi purtroppo
dimenticata: il Pensiero. Ma già, di coloro che questo intermezzo non
comprenderebbero e irriderebbero, quanti hanno compreso le divine
ariette di Pergolese, di Marcello, di Carissimi, di Vivaldi, di
Arcangelo del Leuto etc. etc? quanti le hanno godute pienamente e non a
traverso ridicole retoriche da salotto?

_I Rantzau_, invece, sono una delle opere peggiori del Mascagni; in esse
trionfa quel modo compositivo o meglio costruttivo, che ho già chiamato
autoretorica. Certo, non siamo ancora caduti nella ributtante sciatteria
del _Silvano_, nè nello sforzo tronfio e inconcludente dell'_Amica_. Il
maestro ha in quest'opera ancora tanta dignità in sè da non abbandonarsi
a un'inerzia indifferente o a ricorrere a degli inganni ignobili di
barocca sapienza orchestrale e drammatica. Ma, sebbene questa retorica
sia innocente e quasi fanciullesca, cominciamo però a sentire
nell'ingegno del maestro il serio bisogno di un rinnovamento di stile e
di contenuto; aggiungasi il soggetto ben agro per un musicista monocorde
come il Mascagni. Chè, invece dell'amore, ha in questo dramma il
sopravvento l'odio; e il Mascagni, pur riuscendo fino ad un certo segno
a far prevalere una tenue ispirazione erotica infinitamente più debole
di quelle già avute nella _Cavalleria_ e nell'_Amico Fritz_, non ha
saputo che retoricamente creare il contrasto, l'atmosfera nemica a
questo amore, l'odio. Ed è naturale; chè se il Mascagni può cantare
l'odio erotico, l'odio della gelosia carnale, non saprà mai, perchè
troppo complesso ed estraneo alla sua natura, cantare l'odio per
cupidigia, l'odio nato fra due fratelli per colpa del danaro. Anche
nella scena tra _Alfio_ e _Santuzza_, chissà che ad otturare la ben
facile vena mascagnana non abbiano contribuito ancora la situazione e il
carattere di Alfio, che al Mascagni dev'essere apparsa se non
incomprensibile, certo indifferente, non trattandosi in Alfio d'una
rivolta al tradimento puramente erotico, sibbene della rivolta molto più
fredda e austera, la rivolta al disonore. E anche da questa via ecco che
noi torniamo al semplice centro del carattere mascagnano, a questa
specie di sensualità di primitivo e di meridionale di quest'uomo che non
capisce di tutti i sentimenti umani che quello più popolare di tutti,
l'amore. E che altro di più, in fondo in fondo, hanno sentito i maggiori
a lui Ariosto e D'Annunzio e gli spiriti affini?




III.

Il Ratcliff.


È la quarta opera del Mascagni. Apparsa tre anni dopo i _Rantzau_, era
attesa come un'affermazione più importante e più nuova dell'ingegno del
Mascagni. Ma l'opera, sebbene nella scelta del soggetto sembrasse
accennare a un rinnovamento del contenuto mascagnano, non segna che un
aspetto un po' diverso del contenuto già noto. Si aggiunga che, se
quest'opera è infinitamente più significativa dei _Rantzau_, un
fraintendimento della propria ispirazione da parte del maestro, ha fatto
sì che l'opera al teatro appaia moltissimo meno bella e importante di
quello che non sia nella realtà.

Il libretto, come ognun sa, non è che la traduzione discretamente
sciatta che Andrea Maffei fece della tragedia romantica di Enrico Heine.
Per quel che riguarda il poema heiniano, non è da dubitare che invece di
una tragedia voluta bella e riuscita ridicola, si tratta di uno scherzo
di buonissimo gusto. In un paese dove come nella Germania, il maggior
tragico, lo Schiller, per imitare Shakespeare e i tragici greci
produceva tragedie affatto indegne di stare allato ai sublimi modelli
inglesi e greci, se non altro che per il fatto stesso che avevano
bisogno di modelli per essere intese a dovere; niente di strano se
l'inflessibile critico del cattivo gusto e dell'ingenuità tedesca abbia
voluto contraffare ironicamente quel tipo d'arte con una tragedia in cui
tutto l'arsenale dei luoghi comuni del teatro tedesco — luoghi comuni
che si sono infiltrati discretamente anche nell'opera wagneriana —
venisse a bella posta adoprato con mano umoristicamente prodiga. Del
resto anche senza ricorrere all'ipotesi d'una cosciente satira dei falsi
tragici tedeschi, chiunque abbia dimestichezza con lo spirito di Heine e
con gli spiriti affini e fraterni, sa benissimo come certi loro stati
d'anima, anche senza potersi chiamare umoristici, confinano con
l'umorismo. C'era quasi in essi un'impotenza artistica — impotenza se
noi teniamo fissa la mente alle più sublimi forme dell'arte — e
un'amarezza ironica sempre pronta a zampillare, che facea lor volgere in
un ridicolo doloroso anche ciò che pur avessero intrapreso come qualcosa
di serio. Del quale stato d'anima angoscioso e pure accettato con
serenità, non era esente, a me così pare, neppur lo stesso massimo
Goethe.

Ma, com'ebbi già a dire altrove, Pietro Mascagni con la sua solita beata
ingenuità ignorante poco si è occupato d'indagare il significato
tortuoso e duplice del poema di Heine. Ha creduto così, alla buona, alle
tirate umanitarie del socialistoide Ratcliff, s'è entusiasmato
romanticamente alle apparizioni spettrali nelle foreste scozzesi alla
Walter Scott, ha animato musicalmente l'inanimato contrasto erotico del
protagonista; e ha creato, in mezzo alle brutture d'un'opera enfatica e
volgare, una specie di nucleo musicale, d'un romanticismo schietto e
simpatico, affine, sebben più grossolano, a quello di certe ballate di
Chopin, di certi poemetti vittorughiani e di alcune concezioni
wagneriane della prima maniera.

Ho detto: una specie di nucleo, e avrei dovuto dire addirittura un poema
o una suite lirico-sinfonica. Giacchè se il Mascagni ha creduto di
creare un'opera, a sua insaputa, credo, egli ha creato in mezzo alle
costruzioni inutili di quattro atti che non riescono a star bene
insieme, un centro vivo, un nucleo musicale _a sè_, che è quello che
regge in piedi l'opera dinanzi al pubblico e che impedisce allo stesso
di fischiare quest'opera, realmente, come opera, sbagliata. Ora
l'ufficio della critica non deve esser sol quello di dimostrare
l'inesistenza estetica di quella tale opera, in cui le parti belle non
formino un organismo con tutto il resto dell'opera, ma da questo si
distacchino come frammenti compiuti d'un edificio incompiuto. Vi sono
casi, e il _Ratcliff_ mascagnano è uno di questi, nei quali il
compositore ha realmente _visto_ qualcosa di vivo nel soggetto preso a
trattare, ma è stato, per dir così, insofferente della forma impostagli
dal libretto e ha composto qualcosa di formalmente diverso dalla
ineffettuata attuazione dello schema dato dal libretto, anzi ha creato
un _organismo_ del tutto indipendente da questo schema. Chiunque infatti
ascolti il _Ratcliff_ a teatro, si accorgerà con meraviglia come da
tutto il mare plumbeo dello spartito emergano e s'imprimano indelebili
nella memoria alcuni pezzi, mentre di tutto il resto dell'opera non
rimane in mente che una fluttuazione informe di recitativi e di fragori
orchestrali. La ragione di ciò sta proprio in questo: che il vero
_Ratcliff_ di Mascagni consiste soltanto di quei pochi pezzi, è _tutto_
in quei pochi pezzi. Sono essi, cioè, che ci danno l'immagine
schiettamente romantica e per nulla umoristica che di questa strana
storia s'è formato il maestro; sono essi che hanno diritto di chiamarsi
una delle più ispirate cose del Mascagni; sono essi finalmente che la
critica deve estrarre dall'inutile materia sonora in cui sono immersi e
sperduti, onde render loro la giusta fisonomia.

Non sarà male, per spiegarmi meglio, illustrare l'esempio già citato del
_Vascello Fantasma_. Chi conosce davvero quest'opera (ossia chi l'ha
ripensata criticamente) non stenterà molto a convenire con me esser
l'_ouverture_ dell'opera e la _ballata_ di Senta due pezzi bastanti _da
soli_ a esprimere _tutta_ la leggenda bellissima del maledetto
navigatore condannato in eterno a scorrere i mari del nord sul vascello
misterioso. Infatti le numerose e prolisse scene, che s'aggruppano
intorno a quel nucleo musicale, non sono che un'aggiunta inutile, una
_spiegazione_ che nulla dice di più di quel che già dissero col suo
prodigioso impeto sinfonico l'_ouverture_ e col suo fuoco sentimentale
la _ballata_. La stessa cosa sarebbe avvenuto se da una _Ballata_ di
Chopin e servendosi di essa altri avesse svolto _drammaticamente_ ciò
che in essa è già stato svolto a sufficienza _liricamente_.

Ora lo stesso divario che corre tra l'_ouverture_ e la _ballata_ di
Senta e il resto del _Vascello Fantasma_, corre pure tra i pezzi
_lirici_ del _Ratcliff_ — i quali tra poco analizzeremo — e le scene che
intorno ad essi s'aggruppano. La leggenda dei romanzeschi amori
d'Eduardo Ratcliff e della Bella Elisa, ripetuti, quasi per legge
d'atavismo, dai rispettivi figli Guglielmo e Maria, come può esser
poesia di per sè stessa, cioè all'infuori della versione umoristica
ricamatavi sopra dallo Heine, così può servire, ed ha servito, al
Mascagni, di soggetto a un poema lirico-sinfonico da porsi accanto a
quei leggendari poemi che sono l'_ouverture_ e la _ballata_ del
_Vascello Fantasma_, le ballate di Chopin, e per passare dalla musica
alla poesia, il _Mazeppa_ di Victor Hugo, la _Lénore_ di Burger etc.
etc.

Il primo di questi pezzi lirici è il lungo preludio con cui si apre
l'opera. Esso è una specie di ballata romantica ispirata all'antefatto
della tragedia d'amore di poi svolta. Immaginiamoci una sfrenata
fantasia d'amore di gelosia e di fatalità tragica, fantasia che sarà poi
determinata verbalmente sulla fine del poema: per ora non se ne intende
che il tono tragico e fantastico (adopro qui la parola _fantasia_ nella
sua accezione volgare di soprannaturale, irreale). Come tutte le ballate
romantiche, questo preludio, interrotto dalla canzone fatale: «perchè
rossa di sangue è la tua spada Eduardo?», canzone che nel poema ha il
potere misterioso e ineluttabile che aveva nella tragedia greca
l'oracolo, presenta i procedimenti ormai classici dell'arte romantica: i
ritornelli, le ripetizioni etc. etc. E certo questi procedimenti sono
venuti spontaneamente al Mascagni, che non è da credere ch'egli abbia
una profonda conoscenza del folklore romantico e del romanticismo
folkloristico.

Le scene che seguono il preludio, cioè il fidanzamento di Maria con
Douglas, la descrizione che questi fa della vita londinese, il racconto,
sempre dello stesso, del viaggio per la Scozia infestata dai masnadieri,
sono e inutili nel dramma (naturalmente nel dramma preso sul serio;
satiricamente sono allo Heine riuscite bellissime) e false musicalmente.
Anzi non è qui senza ragione la autoretorica mascagnana; chè, dato lo
sfondo leggendario del dramma, troppo grande è il salto dal carattere
eroico di questa leggenda, e la realtà semiseria d'un buon fidanzamento
che, a dir vero, d'eroico non ha che i costumi scozzesi dei personaggi.
Per trovare una continuazione della leggenda lirica, occorre saltare a
pie' pari tutti questi episodi inutili e leggere l'altra bella ballata
che descrive, alla fine dell'atto, le uccisioni dei due fidanzati di
Maria, tragico frutto della decisione irrevocabile che Guglielmo
Ratcliff ha preso, di uccidere tutti i fidanzati della sua _cara_. Le
parole heiniane sono qui più comiche che terribili. Un musicista che ne
avesse penetrato l'intenzione satirica, avrebbe certo scritto per esse
una finissima musica carica d'ironia. Ma il Mascagni, come sempre, non
ha saputo che risentire senza doppi sensi una tragica vendetta d'amore e
ha scritta una graziosa ballata in due vere e proprie parti o strofe
ritornellate e tutte piene di quei richiami ed echi suggestivi, che sono
come la _musica_ della poesia romantica. Così alla melodia scorrevole
narrativa, che descrive l'innamoramento di Ratcliff per Maria, succede,
bene intonata, la descrizione della ricerca dello sposo mancante alla
cerimonia nuziale. Ed è bello il glaciale fluttuar dell'orchestra
sottolineante la scoperta del cadavere nella foresta a' piedi del Negro
Sasso. Ed è pur bene intonato alla leggenda lo scoppio di fanfara eroica
che alla fine della prima strofa echeggia all'offerta che del teschio
del fidanzato fa Ratcliff a Maria. La seconda strofa della ballata,
saggiamente abbreviata, ripete e nel fatto e nella musica le parti
episodiche della prima. Certo non dico trattarsi qui d'una splendida
ballata come quella di Senta o come una delle sublimi ballate di Chopin.
Ma questa ballata mascagnana non sembrerà affatto brutta se se ne
penetri il tono tutto popolaresco e l'ingenua spontaneità.

È facile trovare nel 2º atto, liberandolo dalle banalità poco spiritose
dei briganti e dell'oste, banalità che ci ricordano, con minor
schiettezza d'ispirazione, le scene zingaresche del _Trovatore_
verdiano, e sfrondando la parte di Ratcliff dalle poco concrete
effusioni socialistiche, il momento musicale che, continua il poema _sui
generis_, in cui dico consistere il vero Ratcliff del Mascagni. È il
racconto che, intrecciato di fantasticherie soprannaturali, Ratcliff fa
del suo amore disperato per Maria. Questo pezzo, di gran lunga superiore
alla ballata del 1º atto, comincia dalle parole «_un lunatico eroe non
mi devi suppor_», e termina laddove ritorna in ballo la sciocca
fantasmagoria dei masnadieri scozzesi (sottintendi, bella nello Heine).
In questo lungo racconto s'incontrano bellezze tali da porre questo
brano di musica accanto alla _Cavalleria_ e all'_Amico Fritz_. Certo il
significato del testo poetico — una morbosa passione inoculata
atavisticamente nel sangue del protagonista — vien sopraffatto e quasi
tramutato dalla sana vena erotica del Mascagni. Sicchè, lentamente, la
mania dell'eroe romanzesco si converte nella solita rubiconda sensualità
popolana del Mascagni. Il bellissimo motivo sulle parole: «_quando
fanciullo ancora_» esprime, sì, qualcosa di misterioso, ma non è il cupo
mistero soprannaturale del testo. Sibbene è il dolcissimo mistero
dell'amore e del piacere carnale, che annega lo spirito e che, se gli
impedisce di discernere nitidamente lo stato sentimentale in cui si
trova, pur non lo acceca tanto da non concedergli una semivisione calda
e quasi direi, se non fosse un controsenso, materiale. Del resto sappiam
forse noi in certi nostri stati d'anima distinguere con precisione i
gradi della insensibile scala per cui l'impressione sensuale si converte
lentamente e per passaggi impreveduti, in intuizione, in percezione, in
spiritualità insomma? Di tutti gli stati sentimentali ambigui e confusi,
lo stato amoroso è il più crepuscolare. Lo spirito si contenta d'una
penombra quasi incosciente, dileguata la quale, dileguerebbe anche la
passione. È questa penombra il _mistero_ dell'amore, e questo mistero si
sente indefinibile e soave in tutto questo bellissimo racconto d'amore.
Così ancora una volta trionfa nell'arte mascagnana, si tratti d'un
soggetto veristico o romantico, l'amore, il solito amore sensuale, sano,
fresco, senza complicazioni psicologiche: e la musica di questo pezzo è
pieno di baci, di rose, di luminose visioni di giardini verdi e solivi,
di tutta quella natura serena e prettamente italiana che riempie della
sua gran pace refrigerante la _Cavalleria_ e l'_Amico Fritz_. Anche gli
scoppi d'odio e i propositi di vendetta di Guglielmo, tentando di
colorirsi delle reboanti esclamazioni romantiche, dove non suonano a
vuoto, parlano dello stesso strazio carnale, dello stesso ribrezzo della
gelosia carnale, che già ispirò la melodiosa _Cavalleria Rusticana_.

E ancor più bello e pieno di questo sensual mistero erotico è
l'intermezzo orchestrale, che ci dà, abbattuta la selva vana di retorici
monologhi che lo circonda fragorosamente, il terzo atto. Nel testo
dovrebbe significare una visione che Guglielmo ha al Negro Sasso nel
vasto orrore della selva sconvolta dalla tempesta, ferito per la prima
volta dal terzo fidanzato di Maria. In realtà è un grande sogno d'amore:
un sogno stanco e doloroso come la contemplazione d'un destino che,
immutabile, contrasti un amore profondo. Dei tre intermezzi mascagnani,
in Italia giustamente amatissimi, questo intermezzo è il più profondo.
Qualunque sia il suo significato preciso nel dramma, esso è un altro di
quei rari momenti di melodia assoluta in cui sembra concretarsi
l'essenza stessa dell'anima d'un compositore. Non siamo qui dinanzi al
canto d'amore aspro e selvaggio della zingaresca che forma l'intermezzo
del _Fritz_, nè dinanzi alla preghiera amorosamente singhiozzante
dell'intermezzo della _Cavalleria_. Questo pezzo più lirico di tutti
perchè più libero degli altri da qualunque contingenzialità del dramma,
sembra metterci in comunicazione immediata con la personalità
mascagnana. Ed è da questo intermezzo specialmente che io ho tratto le
linee principali di codesta personalità, ed è in esso precipuamente che
io ho notato il ritorno dell'anima italiana popolare alla malinconia
erotica settecentesca. Infatti se il titolo (_il sogno di Ratcliff_) ci
avverte dell'ufficio starei per dire simbolico, che nella mente del
compositore ha preso questo divin sogno d'amore, nulla ci vieta di
oltrepassare il simbolo e di cogliere in questo canto tutto
crepuscolare, soffuso di voluttà armoniosa, la più intima essenza della
personalità del compositore. Onde questa melodia semplicissima, sebbene
saviamente orchestrata, si ricollega con le più schiette manifestazioni
della nostra pittura e della nostra poesia.

Il preludietto del 4º atto è un pezzetto di musica di squisita
leggiadria. Continua il poema descrivendo la festa nuziale. C'è in esso
quello strano senso che infonde la musica d'una festa lontana. _L'a
solo_ del flauto è tutto quel che di più elegante possa produrre la
fantasia del Mascagni. Nell'esecuzione dei pezzi staccati che io
consiglio, questo pezzo interromperebbe graziosamente il tono grave
dell'intermezzo e del racconto. Nè stonerebbe, giacchè il carattere
fresco, ma pur sempre misterioso di questa musica di danza, si
ricollegherebbe bene con il carattere misterioso della leggenda
ratcliffiana.

Però, a dire che dopo questo preludietto, la _suite_ di cui è dimostrata
l'esistenza, sia proseguita nel quart'atto, sarebbe farsi troppo schiavi
d'una teoria a danno della realtà. La _suite_ si rompe, per verità, e il
cattivo melodramma spegne nel compositore qualunque spunto di sincerità.
Il quart'atto del _Ratcliff_, se se n'eccettua la ripetizione del primo
preludio a cui è adattata l'esplicazione verbale dell'antefatto a tutto
il dramma, è ammorbato dalla solita autoretorica così comune nel
Mascagni. Anche il duetto tra Guglielmo e Maria è sforzato,
inconcludente, anzi addirittura assorbito in altra e ben più bella
concezione mascagnana, di cui non è un'eco, sibbene un primo abbozzo,
come, a quel che ho sentito dire, è avvenuto di altri pezzi dell'opera;
il duetto, cioè, tra Turiddu e Santuzza. Dunque, mi potrebbe obbiettare
qualche malizioso, tutta la vostra teoria sul _Ratcliff_ non diviene
forse oziosa, se la _suite_ o poema, che voi dite essere il nucleo di
quest'opera, non è neppur compiuto? Niente affatto. La critica, intorno
a questo spartito, che molti credono il capolavoro del maestro, non può
far altro che dimostrare qual sia la sua _vera_ vita, anche ad onta che
tale suo modo di vita appaia qua e là interrotto da lacune, le quali
spetterebbe al Mascagni, reso _cosciente_ del suo lavoro, di riempire —
dato e ammesso che gli artisti fossero così malleabili, da lasciarsi
consigliare dalla critica — cosa che non fanno quasi mai e che, se ci
pensi bene, è forse impossibile che riescano a fare.




IV.

Silvano, Zanetto e Poema leopardiano.


Il romanticismo del _Ratcliff_ dopo il crudo verismo della _Cavalleria_
e lo pseudoverismo del _Fritz_ e dei _Rantzau_, può assumere il valore
d'una prova luminosa della leggerezza artistica del Mascagni, prova che
non viene infirmata dal fatto che il _Ratcliff_ fu concepito avanti la
_Cavalleria_, giacchè, ritornandoci sopra, il maestro ne riaffermava il
contenuto, un contenuto ad ogni modo di significato infinitamente minore
a quello della _Cavalleria_. Ciò che forma, si può dire, la personalità
d'uno Schumann e d'uno Chopin, per non citare sempre i massimi, è
l'_unità_ e la _continuità_ di svolgimento del loro contenuto, il quale,
in costoro, sembra svilupparsi come la vita d'un organismo lentamente e
ininterrottamente crescente su sè stesso. Lo concepite un Wagner che
dopo aver creata la tetralogia scriva una _Carmen_? È assurdo e ridicolo
insieme; chè creare non è solo avere delle lucide intuizioni, ma queste
spontaneamente organare per via di assimilazioni ed eliminazioni, in un
tutto assolutamente originale. In altre parole un compositore deve avere
_coscienza_ delle proprie forze e seguire la linea unica e diritta delle
sue aspirazioni. Ora questa coscienza delle proprie forze o aspirazioni,
o com'altro vogliasi chiamare il _mondo_ d'un artista, è affatto
embrionale nel Mascagni. Come i nostri ultimi operisti — Rossini,
Donizzetti, Mercadante, Bellini, Verdi — anch'egli non sente ambizione
superiore a quella di espandere fiotti di colori su qualunque disegno
gli venga presentato. Questa minima ambizione raffaelliana — mi si
perdoni, ma io scrivo quest'aggettivo contrapponendolo mentalmente a
_michelangiolesca_ — era quella per cui si tributavano maggiori lodi,
per es., al Rossini; ma, se in un certo senso è vero che sopra innumeri
soggetti il Rossini e il Mascagni trovan sempre qualcosa da dire,
bisogna però vedere se questo qualcosa è detto _ad hoc_, o non è
piuttosto un'improvvisazione simile, in parte, a un sonetto a rime
obbligate.

Ora al punto in cui siam giunti del nostro studio, ci è lecito
stabilire, contemplando la serie dei soggetti, già noti a noi, che hanno
fornito al Mascagni l'occasione di _cantare_ il più possibile, sotto un
nuovo aspetto il limite dell'ingegno mascagnano. Noi non possiamo in
fondo in fondo creder molto al romanticismo mascagnano per le stesse
ragioni, anzi accresciute, per le quali abbiamo dubitato del verismo
mascagnano. A una sola condizione noi vi potremmo credere, se
l'abbandono del verismo per il suo mortale nemico il romanticismo, fosse
stato causato da un pieno riconoscimento delle manchevolezze del verismo
rispetto ai bisogni spirituali del Mascagni. Ma, in realtà, questa crisi
potente e violenta nel maestro non è affatto avvenuta. Come già
dimostrai l'indifferenza e forse l'incoscienza assoluta dello spirito
del maestro verso il valore veristico della _Cavalleria_, così non ci
vorrebbe molto a dimostrare una non meno incosciente indifferenza
dell'interpretazione romantica della vita contenuta nella leggenda
ratcliffiana. _Siamo nel paese dove si canta senza sapere il perchè_,
diceva, credo, uno straniero a tempo della feconda polemica tra
Gluckisti e Piccinnisti. E anche oggi Mascagni in linea retta
italianamente discendente del Piccinni, non fa nulla di più che cantare
_senza sapere il perchè_.

Continuiamo la nostra analisi.

La 1ª rappresentazione del _Silvano_ segue appena d'un mese quella del
_Ratcliff_ e questa nova opera di proporzioni più piccole dovrebb'essere
un _dramma marinaresco_. Ma in realtà il mare in quest'opera, che è la
più brutta delle opere del Mascagni, non è che un ridicolo mare di
cartapesta, quale in certi teatri da burattini vien rappresentato con
strisce di cartone dipinte e rumorosamente agitate con delle corde. Nè
il dramma a cui serve di sfondo questo ridicolo oceano _impagliato_, ha
il benchè minimo pregio drammatico. Si tratta d'un sanguinolento
_fattaccio_ recitato da fantocci senza nessuna intimità e ragion
d'essere. La musica poi è un tale accozzo di frasucce o volgari o
addirittura insignificanti, da non meritare quasi il conto d'esser
analizzata. Il mare che pur è stato il benigno custode dell'adolescenza
del maestro e a cui pur questi deve tanta salute di sangue e
d'ispirazione, non gli ha dettato nessuna immagine viva. Come nel
libretto il mare è un incolore luogo comune, così nella fusione del
libretto e della musica esso rimane una vecchissima immagine ritmica e
sonora, quale avrebbe potuto avere, sebben più fine, uno dei nostri
buoni vecchi operisti sordi e ciechi a qualunque voce ed aspetto della
natura. Neppure nel coro marinaresco del 2º atto, dove il maestro
avrebbe potuto almeno darci qualche accento impregnato di sale come le
tamerici salse della spiaggia dell'Antignano, egli sa ritenersi dal
cadere in una fraseologia da borghese canzonetta napoletana. «Cantate la
più bella marinaresca» esclama il coro; ma, ahimè, le note sembrano
intendere proprio il contrario.

Ma quello che dà più malessere in quest'opera insignificante, ne è la
vecchiezza delle modulazioni, l'insipidezza dell'armonia. C'è la falsa
eloquenza dell'agile improvvisator di preludi pianistici per mettere in
tono un coretto d'educande. Si osservino poi i recitativi. Essi non sono
come nella _Cavalleria_ e nel _Fritz_ quasi la _forma_ musicale che
sorgendo ed espandendosi investe e _beve_ le parole, assimilandosele.
Essi son fatti come musicando pezzetto per pezzetto, parola per parola
il libretto, onde resultano sconclusionati ed incerti. Gli spunti
melodici poi riescono odiosi per la ricerca quasi a tentoni della frase
che non vuol venire. L'autoretorica vi trionfa: son come frammenti di
intuizioni precedenti legati alla meglio. Se mai il _Silvano_ può avere
un valore, sarà quello di aver dimostrato al Mascagni tutto il suo
dovere di rinnovarsi. Ormai le belle formule melodiche della
_Cavalleria_, gli _universali fantastici_ del suo stile giovanile, non
gli dicono più nulla, sono strizzati fino ad aver versato tutto il loro
succo. Bisogna ch'egli cessi di strascicare dietro a sè i cadaveri d'una
fraseologia che un giorno fu viva; bisogna che immergendosi in un
silenzio fecondo, ritrovi nel suo segreto la sua limpida vena, che non
s'è seccata, ma solo, non coltivata gelosamente, s'è perduta nel suolo.

Al soggetto sconciamente realistico del _Silvano_, segue con un nuovo
sbalzo, un soggetto di squisita poesia: _Zanetto_ o «_Le passant_» di F.
Coppée. La dolce e intima scena che ne forma il contenuto a dir vero non
era molto consona alla natura esteriore del Mascagni. Occorreva prima di
tutto un librettista che non sbertucciasse il delizioso episodio con
versi che non significano nulla — _Cuore_, c'è il _dolore_, tra il
_profumo_ e lo _splendore_ —, e in secondo luogo occorreva un musicista
di arte molto più evoluta e sinuosa di quello che non sia l'ingenuo e
rozzo linguaggio mascagnano. Certo, se confrontiamo lo _Zanetto_ al
_Silvano_, ci accorgiamo subito che il fascino sentimentale del soggetto
ha suscitato qualche fantasma vero nella inerte immaginazione del
maestro. Il preludio, sebbene così poco intonato alla signorilità
umoristica che dovrebbe avere un madrigale sussurrato in lontananza —
siamo nel Rinascimento, a Firenze —; la canzone di Zanetto sebbene così
poco elegantemente trovadorica; l'appassionata e bell'aria «non andar da
Silvia», sebbene anch'essa troppo plebea per sgorgare dall'anima d'una
grande cortigiana fiorentina; sono brani di musica che invano si
cercherebbe nel _Silvano_. Ma nel complesso l'opera è viziosa; il
recitativo ne è povero, convenzionale, spesso pesante. Si aggiunga, a
momenti, un _cantabile_ indegno della penna d'uno scrittorucolo di
romanze a base di sentimentalità da _Scena illustrata_. So che lo
_Zanetto_ ha esercitato un certo fascino sugli studenti intellettuali
del tempo. Ma credo che essi, se non eran dei babbei, fossero più
vellicati nella loro sentimentalità dall'_idea_ del soggetto, che
dall'_attuazione_ mascagnana di quest'idea. La verità è che quest'idea
non fu saputa incarnare. Convengo però che tra i libretti mascagnani lo
_Zanetto_ è l'unico che, accanto alla _Cavalleria_ e a parte del
_Ratcliff_, può significare qualcosa di poetico.

Mi resterebbe, avanti di passare all'_Iris_, di parlare del _Poema
leopardiano_. Ma io chiedo venia ai lettori se per rispetto alla
innocente gioventù della fresca melodia mascagnana, e per rispetto alla
dignità della mia critica, io getto un velo pietoso su questo _fallo di
gioventù_ del Mascagni. Ho già troppo robustamente lineato il profilo di
quest'arte, perchè ne debba ancora dimostrare l'indifferenza
adolescentesca davanti alle altezze più pure e più formidabili dello
spirito umano. Mascagni e Leopardi sono due spiriti che, avvicinati,
fanno provare la vertigine; appartengono quasi a due mondi diversi.
Credo che sarebbe un giochetto puerile dimostrare una cosa a cui tutti
credono: che Mascagni non può capire nè quindi cantare Giacomo Leopardi.
È possibile che Riccardo Strauss decadente fin nella midolla delle ossa,
senta tutto il decadentismo raffinato ed astuto che già s'annida nel
nietzschiano «Also sprach Zarathustra». Ma è impossibile che un
fanciullo, un monello livornese possa comprendere il _pensiero_ di
Leopardi. Tutt'al più farà, come ha fatto Mascagni, un compito diligente
sul tipo di quelli dal tema: ditemi che sentimenti vi suggerisce la
tomba di Torquato Tasso, o qualche altra tomba o destino umano di cui si
sia impadronita senza remissione la retorica scolastica.

L'Iris.


Riccardo Wagner a proposito dell'opera italianizzante del Meyerbeer ci
lasciò una deliziosa satira di tal sorta di melodramma commerciale, nel
quale gli spettacoli naturali, i costumi esotici dei cori e dei
personaggi, non stanno al dramma, come accidentalità necessarie; sibbene
il dramma, l'azione intima dei personaggi, sta come canevaccio
indifferentemente prescelto a motivare quelle esteriorità che diventano
di massima importanza. Perchè Meyerbeer a un certo punto del _Profeta_
fa sorgere il sole? non perchè ciò sia necessario al dramma, ma perchè
fa più effetto. Perchè il Metastasio a volte metteva in Cina un'azione
melodrammatica assolutamente anticinese? Perchè vestiti alla cinese era
sicuro che i personaggi avrebbero fatto il doppio dell'effetto. Accade
lo stesso per l'_Iris_? Ahimè! io non saprei negarlo; chè anche in
questo io scorgo la filiazione diretta degli spartiti mascagnani dal
passato più o meno prossimo del melodramma italiano e italianizzante.
Vestire da _mousmè_ le donne del coro e la protagonista; mettere per
sfondo un paesaggio esotico di discutibile autenticità; chiamare
_Yoshiwara_ la vecchia europea _maison de plaisir_; insomma
giapponesizzare tutto, dai capelli ai piedi dei personaggi e dalla cime
dei monti alle bassure d'una fogna formicolante di cenciaiuoli che la
scrutano con delle lampadine di... carta del Giappone; è certo una
ricetta sicura per titillare la fantasia e gli occhi del pubblico, non
che la vena del maestro. Infatti al Mascagni nessuna opera è venuta
meglio orchestrata di questa, se per orchestrazione s'intenda l'agile
saettìo impreveduto della bizzarria. Per ogni scena di quest'_Iris_
tremola come un multivolo _troll_ di astuta follìa. I colori orchestrali
s'impastano con delicati e quasi direi fulminei contrasti; e ora
scivolano glaciali e striati come pelle di serpi, e ora ondeggiano come
nebbie leggermente iridate. Ogni tanto un'argentinità squillante e
melodiosa scande il ritmo — ad altra parte l'esame dell'istrumentazione
mascagnana, la quale possiam dire fin d'ora arricchita di tutti i
_modernismi_ più audaci della tecnica strumentale d'oltralpe —; a volte
piene sonorità orchestrali e corali prorompono e allargano i loro flutti
pesanti, ma equilibrati. L'immaginazione del Mascagni è stata insomma
meravigliosamente eccitata anzi sopreccitata dalla poesia nipponica, che
l'Illica ha versato con mani prodighe, se non sapienti, nel suo
libretto.

Ma un libretto in stile floreale — giapponese — d'annunziano, e uno
sfoggio sia pur delizioso d'una ricchissima gamma orchestrale, non
bastano a fare un'opera da mettere accanto alla _Cavalleria rusticana_.
Tutt'al più testimonieranno d'un vero innamoramento del compositore per
il soggetto che ha preso a trattare, ma non varranno a elevare l'_Iris_
all'altezza di opera certificante una presa di possesso più audace e
profonda della personalità dell'autore della _Cavalleria_. La ragion
vera per cui l'_Iris_ se non intera e perfetta come la _Cavalleria_, è
pur sempre l'unica opera degna d'esser detta sorella di quella, è che
per l'_Iris_ noi potremmo ripeter la stessa esclamazione d'Osaka sulla
giovinetta dormente: «non è mousmè leziosa di città — ordigno fatto per
la voluttà — qui c'è l'anima!» Sì, ad onta del nipponismo teatrale, ad
onta dei molti difetti, dei quali maggior di tutti lo pseudo-simbolismo,
in quest'opera c'è l'_anima_. L'ingenuità della innocentissima
giovinetta sul cui corpo piccolo e perfetto passano vani i lubrìci
tentacoli del piacere infecondo, si è fusa con la divina ingenuità della
melodia mascagnana. Il 2º atto, che è il migliore di tutta l'opera, va
posto accanto alla _Cavalleria_. Non credo affatto che il maestro sia
stato pienamente cosciente della bellissima cosa che componeva,
altrimenti avrebbe rigettato come spurio il simbolismo nipponico —
solare che guasta e isterilisce la significazione umana di questo
second'atto. Ma come per la _Cavalleria_ una «fortunata concordanza di
fattori storici ed estetici» condussero il Mascagni a creare un
capolavoro quasi senza ch'egli se ne accorgesse, e cioè senza obbedire a
quelle profonde aspirazioni che formano la vita intima ed austera dei
grandi genî, così in questo second'atto la purezza dell'adolescenza
d'Iris e della spensierata adolescenza della fantasia mascagnana si sono
incontrate per caso e ne è risultato un capolavoro, così, per caso, come
due adolescenti s'incontrano e si baciano senza sapere perchè.
Capolavoro naturalmente, che come già ebbi a concludere per la
_Cavalleria_, per questa mancanza d'una severa coscienza artistica, si
rivela a uno sguardo più profondo e vasto come — _un semicapolavoro_.

Ho detto che il simbolismo è tra i peggiori difetti dell'opera. In
realtà il simbolismo in arte, _non esiste_. Esso non è che una specie di
astrazione che noi fabbrichiamo per impossessarci alla meglio d'un fatto
che spesso si ripete o sembra ripetersi alla nostra analisi
_intellettualistica_, nella grande arte: l'incarnazione artistica, cioè,
d'un pensiero, di per sè stesso — e cioè se estratto dall'opera d'arte e
ricreato logicamente — ripetibile in modi espressivi innumerevoli.
Simbolica si può intellettualisticamente chiamare l'arte del 2º Faust o
della tetralogia wagneriana. Ma se noi paragoniamo il simbolismo
dell'_Iris_ al simbolismo delle sunnominate opere (prego i lettori di
non riderne troppo) ci accorgiamo presto che l'Illica e per conseguenza
il Mascagni ha adoprato tale concetto intellettualistico come concreto,
ed ha applicato il simbolismo al suo dramma volontariamente,
esternamente, più per seguire volente una moda, che per obbedire, al di
qua da qualunque regola e metodo, a un bisogno del proprio spirito.
Perchè infatti, in fondo in fondo, sotto al velame dei versi e degli
accordi strani, qual profondo pensiero troviamo espresso dal simbolo?
Che il sole è il maestro delle opere e delle passioni umane, e che se
l'egoismo degli uomini spinse alla rovina materiale (non mi pare morale,
il che sarebbe stato ben peggio) la piccioletta Iris, la Natura (con l'N
grande) corrompendone il cadavere sotto l'azione vivificante del sole
genera da tale corruzione una nuova vita, cioè fiori e fiori e fiori.
Dio mio! valeva proprio la pena di scomodare l'olimpico simbolismo per
dimostrare che anche il corpo d'Iris diviene dopo tante vicissitudini
dolorose del concime chimico? Giacchè, come ognun vede, nel simbolismo
dell'_Iris_ è lo stesso male di tanto simbolismo d'annunziano (potrei
dir moderno, e anche maeterlinckiano, se non mi premesse dimostrarne
l'esistenza italiana); far cascare dall'alto una verità vecchia, e cioè,
una verità superata, come quelle del positivismo, che s'annidano e
echeggiano in tanta arte moderna, nuova come sentimento, vecchia come
credenza.

Così anche il simbolismo dell'_Iris_ va messo accanto al suo nipponismo
letterario. Esso non ha un valore molto diverso dalle vesti cinesi dei
personaggi melodrammatici metastasiani. Ho detto che è un simbolismo _di
moda_. E sotto quest'aspetto noi potremmo notare che il Mascagni segue
la scuola italiana e l'orma del Verdi, che emerse in ciò, nel seguire —
come molti critici hanno detto quasi una lode enorme — il volubile e
mutevole gusto del pubblico; sebbene ciò, per giustizia, sia vero e non
sia vero.

Ma come non credemmo al verismo e al romanticismo, così neppur crediamo
al simbolismo mascagnano. Infatti la composizione, di poco distante
dell'_Iris_, delle _Maschere_ e dell'_Amica_, ci conferma pienamente
nella nostra opinione. Nè starò a ripetere quel che dissi per la
_Cavalleria_: che, cioè, anche questo simbolismo è uno dei tanti tardivi
contraccolpi, che i movimenti della grande vita artistica europea
generano nei sostrati ciechi della vita cinese del mondo musicale. Si
potrebbe osservare anche qui che al momento in cui l'ingegno del
Mascagni, pronubo l'Illica, si sposava al vuoto simbolismo promulgato in
Italia dal D'Annunzio, già nella stessa Italia era nata l'alba del
giorno, che da quel simbolismo insincero, oltre che errato
esteticamente, ci doveva redimere. Chè già dei giovani e forti critici
attingevano dal pensiero di un nuovo filosofo di pura tradizione
italiano-alemanna, la piena coscienza dell'errore simbolistico e del
falso pensiero che tale errore sceglieva per tramite di manifestazione.
Ma figuriamoci se questo stato di cose lo poteva neppur sospettare — un
musicista!

                   *       *       *       *       *

L'_Iris_, dunque, si apre simbolisticamente con un fragoroso _inno al
Sole_. Esso è ispirato e retorico al tempo stesso. Retorico già ho detto
perchè; ispirato, perchè nonostante la odiosa teatralità wagneriana del
_tema dell'aurora_ e del finale mefistofeliano, il motivo dei primi
albori, e quindi il corale del sole è pieno di movimento e di fuoco.
Mascagni, giunto alla virilità, ha ritrovato l'empito sano della sua
bella melodia, di quella melodia chiara, docile, calda come il sole. E
infatti qualcosa del sole, e non del freddo sole simbolico, ma del
nostro bel sole tirreno che imbionda le nostre larghe città ondeggianti
di bandiere sulle spiagge, nel mare, nelle pianure verdi, nelle pieghe
delle montagne boschive, è in questo ampio canto melodioso e ben
ritmato.

Cessati gli ultimi fragori orchestrali una timida melodia c'introduce
nel minuscolo giardinetto d'Iris. È una serena mattina... giapponese? —
no, italiana. I fiori devono avere un profumo così sano da mettere
appetito. Lasciamo che Iris giovinetta folleggi con la sua bambola;
facendo ciò, ella è leziosa come il nipponismo illichiano. Ecco Osaka e
Kioto che fanno un delizioso _duettino_. Osaka canta le lodi della
propria voce in versi _boursouflés_ e con una adorabile melodia
scapigliata. Ma la sorpresa più affascinante è l'entrata delle mousmè —
lavandaie. Oh! l'incantevole freschezza di questo coretto, a cui
s'unisce la gaia voce mattutina di Iris che annaffia i suoi fiori e la
monotona voce del cieco che prega! Veramente questa musica semplice,
senza le smanie impressionistico — descrittive dello Strauss e del
Debussy, è tutta, per virtù di miracolo, sapida di geranio e di cedrina
bagnati, di borracina mèzza; una gioia agreste si spande per le sue
modulazioni leggere, ed essa è fresca e scorrevole come le innumerevoli
stille d'acqua che spillano dall'annaffiatoio d'Iris. L'errore della
musica descrittiva in generale sta in ciò che in essa si tenta di
cogliere _volontariamente_ e quindi _arbitrariamente_ alcune
_impressioni_, la cui vera vita musicale non potrebbe essere altra che
una _sintesi spontanea_ di esse e, cioè, una _vera_ trasformazione
spirituale della sensazione materiale. Peccato che sulla fine del pezzo
il tumido simbolismo dell'_inno al sole_ rispunti guastando con la sua
volgare convenzionalità tanta freschezza e semplicità!

Un suono curioso annuncia su di un ritmo saltellante la venuta del
teatrino. Questa nuova scena, a dire il vero sempre sprizzante di
trovate fantasiose, non è bella come la precedente. Vi sono anzi episodi
triviali, come quello del dialogo del padre e della figlia da commedia e
dell'ascensione al nirvana di costei: si trova in ispecie nell'episodio
del nirvana un wagnerismo di seconda mano che non significa nulla. È al
contrario bellissima la romanza di Ior. Il Mascagni della popolare
_Siciliana_ della _Cavalleria_ in essa risuscita con nostra grande
gioia. La danza delle _guechas_ è forse musica troppo da operetta, tanto
più che quel ritmo di valse è assai poco... giapponese. La scena finale
dell'atto riesce simpatica per certe movenze melodiche schiette e
persuasive, ma nel complesso è sforzata e pesante. Il Mascagni non sente
profondamente, come avemmo già a notare, altri affetti che l'amore, e
d'altronde le smanie del cieco per l'abbandono della figlia non hanno
neppur nel libretto una chiara e intima motivazione, onde, al postutto,
cieco e merciaioli pietosi convincono al riso più che alle lacrime. Se
al posto del padre si fosse trovato un rivale, un fidanzato di Iris, noi
forse avremmo potuto contare una bellezza di più nel teatro mascagnano.
Amore, amore! il Mascagni non chiede di più per divenire eloquente e
vero artista.

È perciò che il 2º atto gli è riuscito migliore degli altri. Non siamo
qui, è vero, davanti a una tragedia d'amor plebeo, come per la
_Cavalleria_; ma l'intimità dei due drammi è la stessa: la carne, il
piacere sensuale. Se non che l'amore sensuale non è qui frenetico e
feroce come nella _Cavalleria_. Esso s'è raffinato e, pur rimanendo
sano, è divenuto quasi direi meno bestiale. A questa sensualità
consueta, quali che sieno le sue modificazioni, in Mascagni, sembrerebbe
contrastare l'innocenza di Iris; ma, immersa nell'aria di voluttà
carnale che spira la sera dell'Yoshiwara, anche quest'innocenza diventa
una specie di ingenuo eccitante alla sensualità. Buon per noi che sia il
Mascagni a cantarci questo contrasto tra gli allettamenti egoistici d'un
_viveur_ annoiato e la pura ignoranza d'un'adolescente; chè se fosse
stato invece uno Strauss, chi sa a quali ributtanti pervertimenti sadici
ci toccava assistere.

Ma la musica mascagnana di tutto difetterà fuorchè di salute. La melodia
che mugolano le guechas nella penombra calda che circonda Iris dormente,
è incantevole per il buon aroma meridionale sano ed asciutto che
contiene. È una nenia blanda, che fa sognare a non so quali ombre di
giardini sonnolenti nelle canicole mediterranee. Come pure niente di
sadico ha la melodia che sottolinea lo sguardo di voluttuoso desiderio
con cui il leggero amore di Osaka fascia il sonno giovanile di Iris
sotto il velo versicolore. E quali belle melodie espansive non sgorgano
dalle labbra di Osaka ridivenuto, per un momento, veramente giovane
dinanzi a tanta grazia d'adolescenza! Ma ben altro occhio e ben altro
cuore ci vorrebbe per capire Iris; non un Osaka, il quale sospetta sì
che in Iris ci sia un'anima, ma non arriva a misurare quanto bella e
ingenua sia quest'anima, troppo avendolo da essa distanziato la continua
infecondità del piacere. O forse piuttosto per capire la divina bontà di
Iris ci vorrebbe la candida penetrazione d'un buon adolescente plebeo,
che venisse a parlar con lei di soppiatto, dietro il giardinetto
minuscolo, quando fosse giunto il tempo dell'amore e per l'uno e per
l'altra. Ma per Iris il tempo d'amare non è giunto ancora. Sforzarla
all'amore è una viltà di quelle, a cui la natura pone più che può le sue
sacre barriere insormontabili. Iris così non capisce ciò che Osaka
vuole, e risponde al giovane seduttore infantilmente, chiamandolo
«figlio del Sole»; infantilmente si spaventa nella sua religiosità al
nome che Osaka impudente si dà come un magnifico titolo: il piacere.
Neppure capisce ciò che Osaka vuol da lei quando questi la bacia con
lento allettamento. Anzi — e forse un presentimento confuso ha commosso
le sue viscere di bambina — prova terrore del bacio e scoppia in pianto.
E qui tutta l'aridità di Osaka e il suo leggero egoistico amore si
palesano. Egli non vuol ritrosie neppure da parte di una giovinetta
bella come Iris, e accetta infuriato il turpe proposito del tristo
mezzano Kyoto di esporre la fanciulla al pubblico come una cortigiana.

La musica di tutte queste scene sembra a me molto bella. Se se ne
tolgano certe leziosaggini massenettiane nella parte di Iris, è tutto un
seguito di frasi ispirate limpide trascinanti, ben corrispondenti al
flusso della situazione. Perfetta è poi, dopo il grido di Osaka: «_sono
il piacere_» (di cui va ammirata la tortuosa successione delle due
tredicesime maggiore e minore), l'ondulazione, come di un respiro
ansante per paura, che forma il ritmo dell'_aria della piovra_. Forse
questa improvvisa coscienza di Iris, sia pur suscitata dal ricordo d'un
insegnamento religioso e superstizioso, del piacere, è un poco
esagerata. Ma musicalmente poche volte il Mascagni era giunto a tanto
tragica profondità.

Bellissima è poi tutta la fine dell'atto. I recitativi eleganti di
Kyoto, impregnati d'un comico umorismo; le sue lubriche preparazioni; la
dolce purità di Iris che canta con in braccio il fantoccio di Ior, la
stessa romanza di Ior nell'atto primo; i rumori strani della città
oziante nel crepuscolo; l'urlo d'ammirazione prorompente nella gente
«dotta e ghiotta d'ogni cosa vaga e rara» alla vista del divin corpo
seminudo di Iris, il fior di giaggiolo montanino che accende le
cupidigie degli stanchi cittadini spargendo sopra di essi un fascino di
acerbità casta; Osaka che alla vista dello spettacolo turpe non prova
rimorso morale, bensì un volgare rimorso carnale; e finalmente l'arrivo
del cieco, che invece di essere la risoluzione della terribile ansia di
Iris, ne corona l'orrore con la maledizione infamante; e la piccola
Iris, che ignara di tutto ciò che ha veduto come in un sogno pieno
d'incubi e di dolcezze misteriose, non resiste alla maledizione paterna
e s'uccide precipitandosi in un grande abisso «ove in fogna si sfoga la
gran città», forse improvvisamente balenando alla sua breve coscienza
l'infamia in cui è stata trascinata — è tutta una serie di
rappresentazioni vive, rapide, colorite, in cui il Mascagni raggiunge di
nuovo, come nella _Cavalleria_, la sua potenzialità di ingegno
drammatico per eccellenza. E un fortissimo orchestrale, procedimento
classico ormai dell'arte operistica Mascagnana, distende e quindi
scioglie l'ansia delle scene dolorose a cui abbiamo assistito.

Ma, ahimè!, il dramma umano si disfà nell'onda torpida ed ambigua del
simbolismo. Il 3º atto non è più poesia; è giuoco, giuoco vuoto
dell'immaginazione sopra lo sterile sfoggio dei simboli vacui. Certo, se
togliamo il preludio, spenta melodia inutilmente sorretta dalle risorse
d'una strumentazione suggestiva nella sua acida stranezza, la scena dei
cenciaioli e dell'_a solo_ di Iris ha leggiadrie di forma e delicatezze
di malinconie. Specialmente mi pare notevole per il suo schietto
umorismo, contrastante, a dire il vero, con il solito carattere di
fradicia poesia che hanno i simboli dell'Illica, la scena dei cenciaioli
intercalata da quella deliziosa canzone alla luna, ove il Mascagni fa
suoi e purifica certi raffinati procedimenti tonali dell'armonia dei
decadenti moderni. E l'opera si chiude, mefistofelianamente, con la
ripetizione dell'_Inno al sole_.

                   *       *       *       *       *

Non dunque la compiutezza della _Cavalleria_, sebbene, rispetto alle
altre opere del Mascagni, l'_Iris_, anche nelle parti errate, sia da
porsi accanto alla _Cavalleria_ più del _Ratcliff_ e dell'_Amico Fritz_;
nè uno di quei raggiungimenti e possessi _coscienti_ del proprio
contenuto che facciano creare a un artista il capolavoro. Dalla
_Cavalleria_ all'_Iris_ non è processo di crisi. La leggerezza degli
intendimenti artistici ha semplicemente portato il Mascagni a ridarci
con l'_Iris_ un'opera più ispirata delle altre, ma non il capolavoro. Se
non che mi si permetta che, giunto qui, io dica qual sia il valore che
può avere per un ingegno della forza di quello mascagnano, il così detto
_capolavoro_, l'espressione piena di se stesso. In realtà, relativamente
alla potenzialità dell'arte del Mascagni, il capolavoro da lui non può
nascere. Il musicista, nel senso che il Mascagni attua l'opera, come del
resto l'attuarono i suoi fratelli maggiori e minori della tradizione
italiana, non è da più, in fondo, di un affreschista-operaio. Ch'egli
abbia una personalità, nessuno anche all'affreschista vorrebbe negarlo,
chè se mancasse di ciò come potrebbe avvenire che gli uomini lo
chiamassero a preferenza di altri a istoriare vagamente i templi del
loro gaudio e della loro obliosa gioia? La questione è che quella
_personalità_ non è autonoma, libera, piena di un mondo austero e
necessario, che il compositore debba dire ai suoi simili; sibbene, ciò
che distingue quella personalità da un'altra qualsiasi, non è poi molto
diverso da ciò che distingue un paesaggio da un altro; un paesaggio
bello e brutalmente incosciente, cui alcuni uomini per ragioni di
esperienze particolari amano e altri per altre esperienze dispregiano.
Ond'è che il capolavoro di Mascagni se potrà superare in piacevolezza e
freschezza la _Cavalleria_ e l'_Iris_, non ne potrà mai superare il
carattere di casualità e quindi d'inutilità che ho già dimostrato in
esse. «Siamo nel paese dove si canta senza sapere il perchè». E dove,
aggiungerei io, ogni compositore colora tale tradizionalità di melodia,
di colori personali diversi sì, ma dove nessuno dei compositori supera
la tradizionalità cieca creando una forma nuova e piena di significati
veramente storici. In fondo in fondo, sotto la profluvie delle melodie
troviamo il vecchio motivo di tanta arte: _divertire_ o _adornare_, non
esprimere una conoscenza conquistata col sangue. O se mai questa
conoscenza vi sia, e di necessità vi dev'essere, sia pure con un valore
trascurabile, giacchè _personalità_ in arte è _autoconoscenza_; tale
conoscenza personale non è rivolta ad altro — che a divertire la gente.




VI.

Le Maschere e l'Amica.


_Le Maschere_ dovevano essere nell'intenzione del librettista e del
musicista una esumazione dei personaggi dell'antica commedia d'arte.
Esumazione piena di significati poetici e musicali. Da parte del
librettista era come una proposta di abbandonare «i nuovi e strani eroi»
per tornare alla semplice e buona ingenuità della maschera
settecentesca. Da parte del musicista era, oltre al far suo il proposito
del librettista, abbandonarsi a tutta la sua spontanea italianità
tornando alle forme classiche dell'opera buffa.

Il proponimento poteva anche esser bello; sebbene sia saggio notare che
tutti questi _ritorni all'antico_ sono pericolosissimi: giacchè, pur
tralasciando il fatto che è molto dubbio un accordo intero tra il
desiderio d'un artista (che, al modo che l'intende il Mascagni, è, in
fondo in fondo, un servo del pubblico) di tornare al passato e l'anima
del pubblico estranea ormai a questo passato; occorre per infondere una
vita novella nei cadaveri che l'arte nel suo cammino infrenabile lascia
dietro di sè, una ragione profonda nell'artista stesso che si accinge a
tale resurrezione. Occorre che l'artista si trovi in un'opposizione
violenta con i sentimenti e le convinzioni dell'ambiente che lo
circonda; occorre che l'artista si senta più contemporaneo dei morti che
dei vivi; occorre insomma che egli sia dotato di un senso storico
squisito. Con questo non voglio dire che da fraintendimenti storici non
sien nate opere insigni, ma bisogna vedere di quanto le condizioni
dell'ambiente favorivano l'errore di ricostruzione.

Ora, oggi non siam più nel 400 in cui si potessero vestire nei quadri
personaggi orientali con abiti occidentali. Oggi che un musicista come
Wagner ci ha mostrato quanto bene anche con la musica potesse esser
rievocato, con squisita precisione di senso storico, un tempo estraneo e
lontano al Wagner e ai suoi contemporanei — in realtà, s'incolpa i
musicisti moderni di wagnerismo; ma quanti hanno osato seguire le orme
wagneriane nella sua mirabile coscienziosità di erudito! In altre
parole: in un tempo, qual'è il nostro, in cui ogni uomo veramente colto
è cittadino non solo di tutto il mondo, ma di tutta la storia a memoria
d'uomo conosciuta; per una rievocazione settecentesca, quali dovrebbero
esser _le Maschere_ si esige ben altra preparazione lenta e paziente che
quella che ha servito alla composizione delle _Maschere_[8]. Infatti,
possiamo affermare che tanto il librettista quanto il compositore hanno
avuto un'idea che, come tutte le idee di questo mondo, potrebbe essere
stata buona; ma l'hanno attuata servendosi di reminiscenze raffazzonate
alla meglio qua e là, così come venivano alla memoria. Si tratta insomma
d'una resurrezione delle gaie e graziose maschere italiane fatta a
orecchio, dilettantescamente: anzi in alcuni punti suggerisce l'immagine
che i dilettanti, i quali composero quest'opera buffa voluminosissima,
non fossero altri che degli studenti o dei collegiali che, rubacchiando
qua e là versi e motivi, avessero formato un buffonesco pasticcio per
qualche rappresentazione di beneficenza nel teatrino del collegio o in
qualche teatro ceduto gentilmente per l'occasione.

  [8] Per preparazione lenta e paziente non intendo soltanto la
  fredda ricerca di biblioteca; intendo, e più, quella larghezza di
  conoscenze, quella disposizione psicologica a comprendere il
  passato che ha fatto creare a Ettore Berlioz quel suo meraviglioso
  _Benvenuto Cellini_, la cui bellezza, sono convinto, sarebbe
  rapidamente gustata in Italia, di cui sì giusto riflesso si
  espande in quella bellissima opera obliata, o meglio, mai
  conosciuta.

La questione è che Pietro Mascagni ha, come ormai deve apparir chiaro da
quanto è scritto fin qui, un'italianità affatto spontanea. Egli non ci
può dare un'opera di reazione _ai nuovi e strani eroi_ immigrati
dall'estero nell'arte italiana, in quanto che anche di fronte a questi
nuovi e strani eroi — _Iris, Amica, Ratcliff_ etc. — egli è rimasto
indifferente, anzi assolutamente italiano; sicchè essi, i nuovi e strani
eroi, metamorfosati dalla sua musica, acquistarono in grazia del
Mascagni stesso pieno, sebben discutibile, diritto di cittadinanza
italiana. Per correggere un difetto bisogna, anzitutto, averne intera e
lucida coscienza. E il Mascagni ha tanta poca coscienza della
_initalianità_ di certi suoi personaggi, che, ripeto, aveva fatto come
Verdi, aveva chiamato quasi tutti i suoi eroi dall'estero, se non
addirittura dall'Estremo Oriente.

A Giosuè Carducci, per ridestare la morta poesia italiana non malata a
dir vero di troppo amore per la grande poesia d'oltr'alpe, ma se mai
distrutta da una specie di vizio solitario per furor di se stessa, era
bisognata un'intera vita di dignitoso dolore, onde finalmente
riacquistar piena coscienza e dell'errore dell'ambiente letterario in
cui egli viveva, e dei mezzi necessari alla sua nuova grand'arte
italica. Dai _Juvenilia_ alle ultime odi è tutta una serie ascensionale
di tentativi più o meno felici che l'Omero dell'Italia risorta dovette
fare per svincolarsi dalla retorica e salire alla gran luce paterna di
Virgilio e di Dante. Finchè nelle _Odi barbare_, nel cui titolo appare
il solito dignitoso dubbio di non esser riuscito a riconquistare la pura
italianità per tanti anni cercata, ecco che Giosuè Carducci,
trasfigurato come un profeta, può intonare sicuro il nuovo Carme
secolare, l'ode _Nell'annuale della fondazione di Roma_.

Ora qual'ansia di ritornare alle più schiette sorgive italiane,
all'italianità non melodrammatica, vana e retorica, come la letteratura
da cui il Carducci seppe liberarsi integrandola nel suo immenso mondo
poetico-storico, ma sacra come la pace bronzea dei grandi miti romani,
nobilita l'opera del Mascagni? Egli nè ebbe fin dall'inizio del suo
cammino, nè ritrovò cammin facendo, l'ideale d'un arte austeramente
italiana, per cui dovesse combattere le forme ibride, ed aspirasse al
ritorno d'una grandezza italica nella musica forse mai come nella poesia
e nelle arti plastiche esistita, ma soltanto per un momento desiderata e
cercata. Eppure la italianità del Mascagni io stesso mi sono adoprato a
dimostrare, nonchè a cercare di rendere più tersa e più ammirevole. Ma
nel risolvimento di questa apparente contradizione io trovo una conferma
della natura popolaresca del Mascagni. Italiano è egli, anzi italiano
più d'ogni altro compositore nostrano in questo momento. Ma la sua è
italianità irriflessa, incosciente, e quindi incapace per la sua
incoscienza stessa di trarre dall'ambiente l'urto necessario onde
trovare sicuramente le grandi vie che riconducono alle culle della
nostra razza e al genio che ad esse presiede.

Così al Mascagni era impossibile ridestare quella coscienza profonda
dell'italianità che intraluce nelle formidabili creazioni di Dante, di
Virgilio, di Carducci. Così _le Maschere_, opera inutilissima, sarebbe
indegna ancora d'un'analisi, non potendo la critica abbassarsi alla
considerazione d'un'opera in cui si sfiorano irriverentemente i problemi
più sacri dell'arte italiana, e quindi della vita della nostra nazione,
se quest'irriverenza stessa in fondo in fondo non fosse affatto
irritante, ma ingenua e adorabile come certe inconsideratezze degli
animi molto giovani, e se in quest'operetta da collegiale non ci fossero
alcuni gioielli d'una purezza assolutamente italiana. Ho già detto, e
non è male ripetere, che è pur troppo caratteristico del melodramma
italiano ottocentesco il non curare affatto l'insieme dell'opera, ma le
singole parti, anzi _soltanto_ alcune delle singole parti, e ho già
detto come nelle opere più sbagliate e incoerenti del Verdi del Bellini
del Donizzetti del Rossini del Mercadante la critica deve fare una
scelta rigorosa ma non implacabile dei pezzi che, estranei all'insieme,
continuano, quasi con un egoismo indifferente, la tradizione del
linguaggio musicale italiano. Questa scelta va pur fatta nelle
_Maschere_, e noi siamo qui per salvare onestamente dalla condanna dello
spartito la sinfonia il duetto d'amore e le due danze del 2º atto, ben
esigua quantità date le proporzioni gigantesche della partitura, ma di
tal qualità, che sarebbe ingiustizia estetica trascurare.

Chè, a dir vero, se il Mascagni avesse continuata l'opera con lo stesso
tono con cui l'aveva incominciata nella sinfonia, _le Maschere_
sarebbero riuscite una cosa assai bella. Questa sinfonia infatti vuol
riprendere e riprende lo stile delle sinfonie rossiniane o mozartiane, o
come più piaccia denominarle. Cosa in fondo non difficile a un musicista
che molto ami la nostra musica antica. Però quello che dà una grazia
simpatica a questa leggiadra sinfonia, è che i temi i contrappunti che
servono a colmare il vecchio schema della sinfonia da opera buffa, son
tutti profondamente mascagnani.

Così è delizioso il modo con cui alla pomposità del cominciamento
rossiniano succedono gli episodi melodici e contrappuntistici di
contenuto affatto moderno. Bella particolarmente riesce nell'episodio a
ottavi ribattuti — _more rossiniano_ — l'armonia acidulamente moderna
con cui il disegno s'inalza e s'abbassa. E dolcissimo è il cantabile che
intercala per tre volte, una delle quali melanconicamente in minore, gli
scherzosi movimenti a crome. Che però questa sinfonia fosse purtroppo
più fatta per un gioco piacevole e ben riuscito, che per una profonda
intenzione di ripristinare le forme classiche secondo un raffinato
metodo il quale avrebbe dovuto del pari essere applicato a tutta
l'opera, lo dimostra il fatto che il maestro non ha saputo andar più
oltre della sinfonia, il resto dell'opera non essendo moderato dalla
grazia dei modelli che hanno ispirato la sinfonia.

Sono pure intonatissime le due danze: la _pavana_ e la _furlana_. La
prima è un lento movimento di gavotta a cui a suo tempo si sposano
settecentescamente due sentimentali strofe del tenore. La grazia del
ritmo, la delicatezza della melodia, la semplicità dei mezzi, fanno di
questa danza un altro gioiello che il Mascagni ha donato alla nostra
musica. Quest'arte della danza non barocca, non pervertita da intenzioni
letterario-decadenti, ma schietta e fresca, è un segreto della musica
italiana e francese e andrebbe conservato con gelosia. Il Mascagni ha
per la danza semplice, amabile, senza sottintesi sadici o artifizi
volgari, una vera disposizione. Si ricordi il leggiadrissimo preludio
del 4º atto del _Ratcliff_ descrivente la danza nuziale: si ricordi la
danza delle guechas sebbene infinitamente inferiori alla danza nuziale
del _Ratcliff_; e si ricordi più di tutto la meravigliosa monferrina
dell'_Amica_, in cui sembra aleggiare lo spirito ingenuo ed elegante di
Mozart.

La _furlana_ è un gaio movimento di tarantella più comune e meno eletta
nel suo svolgimento, ma pur sempre preziosa per l'italianissimo brio che
la ritma.

Mi resta a parlare del duetto, sebbene di questa opera interamente
fallita bisognerebbe notare ancora il dolcissimo _cantabile_ di Rosaura
e Florindo nel pezzo concertato che chiude il 1º atto.

Ma questo cantabile è una vera gemma sciupata dal contorno volgare e
insipiente che la avviluppa quasi indistricabilmente.

Nè la prima parte del duetto in questione è molto al disopra di questo
pezzo concertato, e non ne avrei certo parlato se la melodia che ne
forma la 2ª parte: — Colma di fiori incanti — è il mondo, eterna patria
— e il prato ancora talamo — è di liberi amanti — non fosse un brano di
musica dove il Mascagni raggiunge forse la più pura espressione del suo
sentimento predominante se non addirittura l'unico: l'amore. Ho già
detto che in Mascagni c'è quasi una estrema fioritura dell'erotismo
sensuale e melanconico del 700. Questo rifiorimento, che per essere
spontaneo, non ha a che vedere con la resurrezione riflessa della
maschera italiana — resurrezione, come già osservammo, negata alla
troppa ingenuità mascagnana — trova in questa melodia una espressione
insuperabile. Una certa dignità di linea di ritmo di armonizzazione, una
specie di puerilità leziosa che ci rende adorabili Florindo e Rosaura, i
canori amanti rosei e paffuti che si sbaciucchiano come due colombi,
avvicinano questa del Mascagni alle più dolci arie del 600 e dell'800.
Forse al Mascagni non sarà concesso più di _cantare_ con tanta
voluttuosa castigatezza di modulazioni di melismi e di ritmo.

Con la castigatezza di questo duetto e con la semplicità scherzevole
delle danze e della sinfonia contrastano violentemente le pesanti
polifonie orchestrali e gli esagerati strillanti recitativi
dell'_Amica_. Quest'opera era stata attesa rispetto all'_Iris_, come il
_Ratcliff_ rispetto alla _Cavalleria_ e, cioè, come qualcosa di
definitivo, di affermativo, nell'opera del Mascagni, che tutti, anche i
critici più facili e proclivi alle lodi senza senso comune, sentivano
mancare, quasi direi, d'equilibrio estetico. Ma infinitamente inferiore
al _Ratcliff_, l'_Amica_ non aggiunge nulla alle cose già dette dal
Mascagni, se non se ne eccettui lo sforzo di dirle più forte e più
pomposamente. Giacchè l'autoretorica dell'_Amica_ differisce
dall'autoretorica del _Silvano_, per esser questa quasi direi
un'autoretorica accettata ingenuamente, quella una autoretorica, mi si
perdoni il bisticcio, doppia e cioè voluta nascondere con lo sfoggio
della bravura tecnica. Gli spunti melodici dell'_Amica_ sono infatti,
come quelli del _Silvano_, tutto quel che di trito di vecchio di stanco
poteva produrre la fantasia del Mascagni in un momento di aridità. Ma a
questa specie di retorica iniziale s'aggiunge una seconda retorica nello
svolgimento di essi spunti.

Si prenda, ad esempio, nel 2º atto tutto lo squarcio finale dell'opera —
l'_a solo_ d'Amica e la sua morte. L'orchestra rugge una frase di nessun
valore. Onde di suoni si modellano su linee d'architettura sonora di
nessuna novità. Ma quale sfoggio di colori pesanti, wagneriani! Un
cromatismo insopportabile, un'esasperazione continua dei sentimenti, in
fondo anch'essi di nessun valore drammatico, dei personaggi, rendono il
continuo ammassarsi delle parti strumentali ridicolo più che brutto. E
il ridicolo raggiunge il colmo, quando Amica, che come tutte le ragazze,
sian pure alpigiane, non peserà più, se ben portante, di 90 chili,
precipita giù dalla roccia nel torrente con tal fragore di
_schlaginstrumente_, da far credere che ruzzoli giù per la montagna non
una giovinetta ma un battaglione intero d'artiglieria e, se più sembri
opportuno essendo la scena sulle Alpi, l'armata ricca di cariaggi e
d'elefanti, d'Annibal dirò.

Nell'_Amica_ noi non riconosciamo più Mascagni. La sua cara e fresca
sentimentalità s'è convertita in quella forma di teatral volgarità di
sentimento che, come osservai nella prima parte di questo lavoro, forma
la delizia della vita intellettuale della plebe e dei piccoli borghesi.
Diciamo francamente che nessuna cosa al mondo, sotto questo aspetto,
meritava l'onore di essere spedita all'esposizione del cattivo gusto
come l'aria: _più presso al ciel — più lontan dalla terra_, aria che fa
fremere di ribellione alle mamme e ai babbi i buoni fidanzati al cui
sospirato matrimonio l'accorgimento pratico dei parenti oppone la
magrezza dello stipendio guadagnato alle vie ferrate.




RIPROVE E CONCLUSIONI.




L'ORCHESTRATORE.


Non è ancor stata fatta, se non parzialmente e con intenti per lo più
erronei, una storia dell'orchestrazione dalle origini alla presente
fortuna, che, nel concepimento della musica europea, ha l'uso dei
multipli colori strumentali. Ed essa potrebbe farsi, e sarebbe utile, ad
un sol patto: di non fare un'astratta storia naturalistica delle varie
tecniche orchestrali quali sembrano essersi svolte nel tempo;
sibbene tenendo dinanzi alla coscienza, che svellere l'atto
dell'orchestrare dall'interezza dell'atto creativo torna a mutilare
intellettualisticamente l'unità totale dell'atto creativo; onde unica
storia dell'orchestrazione potrebbe esser quella, in cui proiettassimo
continuamente sulla serie degli elementi astratti da noi ammassati in
ordine cronologico le luci delle individualità or massime or grandi or
mediocri. Per spiegarmi meglio citerò la possibile storia della
versificazione italiana, storia nella quale andrebbe dimostrato — come
nel 200-300 il verso italiano ebbe agilità acerba e spontanea perfezione
non più di poi raggiunte, essendo allora immediata e primitiva davanti
alla natura l'anima dei poeti grandi e dei popolari — come col Petrarca
e col Boccaccio incominciano i preludi dell'umanismo e i sintomi dello
sfiorire del giovanissimo verso italiano mancando nei poeti al Petrarca
posteriori «l'insuperabile pregio dei poeti primitivi che deriva
dall'aver essi fortemente sentito e trasmesso ne' versi l'effetto
prodotto nella lor fantasia dallo spettacolo della natura», ed
accadendo, al contrario, che quei poeti postpetrarcheschi (eccettuato, a
suo modo, l'Ariosto), «pigliarono per modello non la natura, sibbene i
primitivi esemplari, sui quali le osservazioni dei filosofi stabilirono
certe regole, e gli artefici si obbligarono di seguirle. Così la Poesia,
che non è se non una facoltà naturale, si ridusse ad un'arte». E in tale
storia della versificazione avremmo le riprove — che l'Ariosto fu
l'unico che avesse avuto una musicalità di verso originale, sebbene
ormai ben lontana dalla freschezza del verso trecentesco, predominando
anche in lui «l'imitazione dell'imitazione» — e che la retorica trionfò
nella massima parte dei nostri poeti «che fiorivano senza frutto; si
confondevano coi mediocri; scrivevano gli uni per gli altri e non per
l'Italia». Finchè preceduta dai solitari (Leopardi) e dei profeti
(Foscolo) non nacque l'arte del Carducci e l'arte in gran parte nuova e
schietta dei presenti poeti: nei quali a riprova della rinascita della
poesia italiana sta l'originalità assoluta del verso non barocco, non
stantio, ma vibrante di nuova spontanea armonia.

La stessa storia andrebbe fatta per l'orchestrazione in termini
infinitamente più vasti; chè se la musica ha consuetudini e
tradizionalità d'espressione in ogni paese, come la poesia, onde si
formano singolarità di linguaggio etnico, riconoscibili dagli esperti a
colpo sicuro; essa è però, a differenza della poesia, di sua
natura più universale, per lo che non potrebbesi fare una storia
dell'orchestrazione italiana al modo stesso che la si può fare della
versificazione italiana. Senza far qui una traccia storica
dell'orchestrazione (nella quale dovrebbe rientrare di necessità la
quasi incalcolabile produzione dell'arte corale, nonchè la strumentale
dei singoli strumenti che precedette separò accompagnò lo sviluppo della
moderna sinfonistica), osserverò come, al punto cui oggi siamo giunti,
l'orchestrazione derivi in ogni paese dalle massime correnti orchestrali
tedesche del 700-800. Una lunga epoca di preparazione punteggiata per
così dire dalle magnifiche conclusioni di Haydn e di Mozart, mette foce
nella perfetta arte sinfonica beethoveniana. Beethoven, come
psicologicamente rappresenta uno dei momenti massimi dell'umanità, il
grande ricorso storico del romanticismo, considerato dal punto di vista
dell'orchestrazione, quivi pur rappresenta uno dei culmini della musica.
È opinione, più risibile che volgare, oggi, in cui tanto si fraintende
il valore estetico dell'immenso spirito beethoveniano, di tanto
l'umanità presente è lontana da quell'austera forza di sentimento e di
pensiero; è opinione, dico, che Wagner superasse tutto il passato
nell'arte dell'istrumentare e che oggi anzi accenni a superar Wagner
istesso il decadente Riccardo II. E non si comprende come, rispetto alla
perfezione di Beethoven, si commetta lo stesso errore grossolano che se
si affermasse il Petrarca il Tasso l'Ariosto superar nell'arte del verso
la perfezione naturale di Dante.

Poichè, in realtà, a chi conscio dei valori morali d'un'epoca non si
lasci abbagliare dalle funambolesche bravure tecniche degli artisti, che
in tale valutazione critica riescono minori o addirittura distrutti, la
sinfonistica dei postbeethoveniani non può non apparire quale una
continua _decadenza formale_, per essere appunto generata da una sempre
crescente degenerazione e corruzione del perfetto contenuto romantico
che, a parer mio, raggiunse nell'opera beethoveniana la sua plenitudine
espressiva. Or questa degenerazione di contenuto, è anche, sotto un
certo aspetto, discendenza formale e in questa discendenza e derivazione
noi possiamo cogliere diverse correnti, le quali più o meno si
ricollegano all'orchestrica beethoveniana. Sembra quasi l'arte
strumentale di Beethoven come un frutto che giunto a maturità s'apra
lasciando irraggiare intorno a sè la fecondità innumerevole del seme. La
principale corrente che nacque dalla nona sinfonia dalla _Missa
solemnis_ dalla 5ª dalla 3ª dalle ultime sonate dagli ultimi quartetti e
dal resto delle composizioni beethoveniane, è la corrente wagneriana.
Potente e violento artista, Wagner trasformò più di tutti i componenti
la famiglia dei postbeethoveniani, il patrimonio lasciato dal padre. Ma
come non era nel contenuto di Wagner la perfetta ragion storica d'essere
e di incarnarsi nella forma più sana, che era invece in Beethoven,
Wagner invece superò tutti nell'opera di corruzione[9]. Al modo stesso
che egli non seppe dire agli uomini la serena parola d'un dolore
moralmente sublime, ma meglio non seppe fare che spingere gli agitati
romantici fratelli che lo circondavano all'apostolico rifugio d'un
misticismo in piena contradizione con le aspirazioni più pure dello
spirito che anima la pienezza della storia moderna; egli neppur potè
trattenersi dal cadere nell'errore in cui precipitano tutti coloro, che
lavorano su di un contenuto contradittorio: l'esagerazione, la
tronfiezza, la «furibonda enfase sonora». Onde oggi la molta anzi ormai
incalcolabile oziosità e falsità dei ripieghi e dei farmachi con cui
tenta medicarsi l'anima moderna dalla «corrottissima decrepitezza della
civiltà», trova nel wagnerismo il sistema migliore d'orchestrazione che
ci sia[10]. E Riccardo Strauss non prova fatica a immergere nelle forme
mistiche del politemismo wagneriano il sadico contenuto d'una _Salomè_ e
d'una _Elettra_; nè Claudio Debussy a immergere in quelle forme,
modificate da uno spasmodico e impotente bisogno d'originalità, la
«fatuità» del misticismo maeterlinckiano.

  [9] Questo mio giudizio storico-morale su Wagner non va
  assolutamente confuso col giudizio che Francesco de Sanctis
  pronunciò su Wagner come «corruttore della musica». Il de Sanctis
  (e con lui, per altre vie, lo Hanslick) intendeva la _musica_ in
  astratto, io intendo invece la musica _postbeethoveniana_. I due
  critici succitati non seppero porre sulle sue vere basi il
  problema estetico dell'_opera_, con rigidità troppo
  intellettualistica scavando un solco incolmabile tra la musica e
  la poesia. In realtà, per ora, quella forma _espressiva_ che è
  l'opera non è stata attuata così pienamente come da Riccardo
  Wagner, che non ha unito, come troppo comunemente si crede e si
  dice, due arti viventi a sè, sibbene ha espresso la sua intuizione
  centrale in un linguaggio che per riprodurla non frammentariamente
  ed ambiguamente, ha bisogno di suoni articolati, di suoni
  armonizzati e di gesti. Dire che Wagner ha riuniti (e non potrebbe
  trattarsi che di una sovrapposizione e quindi spesso di un
  _duplicato_) e il linguaggio poetico e il linguaggio musicale, è
  fare lo stesso errore che dire Eschilo aver riunito la poesia e la
  mimica (la danza).

  [10] E non solo d'orchestrazione. Il wagnerismo ha invaso la
  pittura, la poesia, la scultura, nonchè l'architettura.

Ma la frantumazione della tecnica beethoveniana, accanto alla corrente
wagneriana, produsse, minore e men facile ad essere seguita, anche
perchè più sincera e meno consona al gusto di frenetica violenza che
impera nell'arte moderna, un'altra corrente: la corrente schumanniana.
Non meno ricca di elementi di degenerazione e di decadenza, l'arte dello
Schumann dalla severa virilità beethoveniana si allontana non allo
stesso modo con cui vi si allontana l'arte wagneriana. Se questa trova
lo specifico per la guarigione a un'ansia da nevrastenici nel
misticismo, quella trova non uno specifico, sibbene, e più naturalmente,
un'accettazione ironica sentimentale di tale ansia nell'umorismo. Il
movente è lo stesso: l'insofferenza d'una vita resa insopportabile da
una mancanza di vera moralità che ne razionalizzi eroicamente le feroci
contorsioni contradittorie. Ma Wagner ci insegna misticamente che
bisogna dissolversi nella contemplazione del mistero, lo Schumann, in
fondo in fondo, si comporta dinanzi alla «corrottissima decrepitezza»
della sua povera vita come, certo con maggiore ingegno, Heine.

In che si distinguono queste due correnti tecniche dell'orchestrica e
moderna? Non mi è in animo sprecare spazio e tempo per un'analisi che
riuscirebbe poi incompleta, occorrendo a tale genere di ricerche e di
confronti volumi interi e preparazioni laboriose. Mi limiterò a
suggerire a chi non abbia mai pensato un simile confronto, come la
tecnica wagneriana differisca dalla tecnica schumanniana nell'essere —
la prima frutto d'un rigido complicato sistema e quindi nel resultato
poco elastica e monotona; — la seconda molto più libera snella e
leggiera. Nella prima _agiscono_ come personaggi, o meglio come simboli
gli strumenti; nella seconda gli strumenti non hanno valore _solitario_
nè tanto meno simbolico, ma sono, per dir così, senza individualità
contribuendo quasi con ufficio di _coro_ a sottolineare a colorire a
_registrare_ come i timbri d'un organo lo svolgimento delle idee. Quella
di Schumann sembra apparentemente un'orchestrazione più astratta e
quella di Wagner più concreta, ma in realtà le parti vanno invertite.
Wagner, laddove l'ispirazione non lo trascini e non gli gonfi — non so
dir meglio — le forme che come vuoti canali egli scava fabbricandole
sempre sullo stesso schema, è un raziocinatore, un critico filologo che
ha imposte alla musica drammatica le regole scoperte da' glottologi
nell'organismo delle lingue. Lo Schumann è invece più immediato più
intimo più casto. Wagner, ripeto, ha violentata, innestandovi anche la
tradizione bachiana, la nitida orchestrazione beethoveniana. Lo Schumann
è rimasto più vicino e più fedele al tipo puro di quell'orchestrazione.
Si confrontino infatti le partiture d'una sinfonia di Beethoven e di
Schumann con quelle degli atti d'uno spartito wagneriano dal _Rheingold_
in giù: si vedrà chiaramente che ciò che differenzia Beethoven da Wagner
differenzia quasi allo stesso modo[11] Schumann da Wagner. Una conferma
storica della maggior purezza di tradizioni orchestrali nello Schumann
piuttosto che in Wagner la troviamo nel beethovenismo per lo più
retorico, ma significantissimo al caso nostro, dell'epigono di Beethoven
e anche di Schumann, il Brahms.

  [11] Dicendo così potrebbe saltare in mente a qualche fanatico
  quanto cieco wagneriano che sta appunto in questo _allo stesso
  modo_ l'inferiorità di Schumann a Wagner rispetto a Beethoven. Ma
  ciò vorrebbe dire che il fanatico wagneriano non avrebbe mai
  compresa l'originalità indiscutibile di Schumann per nulla
  inferiore a quella di Wagner. Onde l'obbiezione non meriterebbe
  d'esser discussa.

Come molti compositori moderni, eccettuato lo Strauss despoticamente
dominato da Wagner — Claude Debussy, natura più latinamente armoniosa,
risente l'influenza e wagneriana e schumanniana, questa quasi come
reattivo a quella — Pietro Mascagni porta nella sua tecnica sinfonica le
traccie della nova rivoluzionaria tradizione wagneriana e della più
classica tradizione schumanniana-beethoveniana.[12] Nonostante che pur
su di lui Wagner estenda la sua «cappa di piombo», come è stato
giustamente detto, del Wagner egli poteva assimilare timbri, impasti, e
ricette d'effetti, ma non poteva per sua natura italianissima, prender
ciò che forma l'essenza del wagnerismo, il sistema glottologico dei
leitmotive. Onde, come già dicemmo per il simbolismo, per il
romanticismo, per il verismo del Mascagni, anche il suo stilistico
wagnerismo è «a orecchio» e spesso si riduce una verniciatura che
potrebbe esser scrostata senza danno di sulla musica, laddove certo non
ne abbia intaccata la vita stessa, riducendola a mero sforzo retorico,
come accade per l'_Amica_. Al contrario era facilissimo al Mascagni
rivivere la tradizione classica — d'una orchestrazione cioè di chiara e
semplice struttura — tramandata attraverso Haydn Mozart Beethoven
Schumann Berlioz Brahms fino al recente Giuseppe Verdi. E infatti non è
il Mascagni un figlio somigliantissimo del nostro buon Verdi che
nell'_Otello_ e nel _Falstaff_ raggiunge la stessa squisita parsimonia e
modernità di mezzi estranei al sistema wagneriano, che si ammira
nell'istrumentazione delicatissima dello Schumann? E non è alla fin
delle fini, questo tipo classico d'orchestrazione estraneo al tipo
wagneriano, di origine, se non di perfezionamento, latina? La perspicua
chiarezza dell'orchestrica beethoveniana non si avvicina più alla
limpidità mediterranea[13], che al goticismo misterioso dell'arte
nordica?

  [12] L'influenza dello Schumann nell'orchestrazione moderna non va
  tanto derivata dalle vere e proprie opere sinfoniche, sibbene, e
  moltissimo, anche nella sinfonicissima musica per pianoforte.

  [13] È bene, ad evitar malintesi, osservare come il Mascagni per
  la sua inferiore italianità, anzi bassa meridionalità, di quanto è
  lontano dal pensiero wagneriano, di tanto, e forse più, è lontano
  dall'altezza solitaria del pensoso dolore beethoveniano. Il
  Mascagni si trova sulla direzione orchestrale classica, che mette
  capo a Beethoven, senza aver coscienza di questa sublime
  vicinanza. Così la perfetta armonia della concezione beethoveniana
  sta all'equilibrio mascagnano, sebbene questo inquinato da
  elementi rovinosi, come la perfetta latina simmetria della
  Commedia dantesca, sta alla classica stabilità dell'Orlando
  Furioso. Con la differenza — che il Mascagni non è davvero
  l'Ariosto.

Ed ecco che anche sotto il punto di vista della orchestrazione, veniamo
ad avere una conferma di quanto dicemmo sulla italianità incosciente di
Pietro Mascagni. Italianamente egli orchestra le sue fresche danze e i
preludi e gli intermezzi (perfetta è la strumentazione della
_Monferrina_ nell'_Amica_, della _Sinfonia_ delle _Maschere_ etc.);
italianamente egli colora la base su cui si svolge il fregio nitidissimo
della sua bella melodia italiana; ma la sua coscienza critica — e meglio
sarebbe dire estetica, che gli artisti non hanno coscienza critica che a
un grado quasi direi pragmatistico — non è mai giunta a rappresentarsi
con chiarezza i cammini che si dovevano seguire per creare, se non di
più, almeno un'opera come l'_Otello_ del Verdi. Il Mascagni così non ha
saputo espungere dalla sua orchestrica la retorica wagneriana,
inconciliabile nemica alla semplicità virgiliana della nostra più grande
arte. Non ha saputo riattaccarsi con vigore all'unica tradizione a cui
spetti il diritto di generare la tecnica strumentale della nostra musica
— la tradizione beethoveniana-schumanniana. C'è in lui spontaneo questo
bisogno[14], ma è un bisogno spesso non compreso, quindi mal
soddisfatto, anzi addirittura calpestato per gettarsi in una polifonia
tronfia e vana, mancando in essa la sua ragion prima, un pensiero o se
non altro una pensosità, un pensiero latente. Le ramificazioni
aggrovigliate dello sviluppo tematico nel _Tristano e Isotta_ sono, per
dir così, tutte intrecciate alla trama complessissima d'un pensiero che
ne vivifica l'astruso labirinto. Ma se i temi del sole e dell'aurora si
ripercuotono com'echi sordi per la partitura dell'_Iris_, nessuno
dubiterà che quelle ripetizioni wagneriane non sieno un artificio
esteriore, tutt'al più pittorico-descrittivo. Mentre quando il Mascagni
svolge una fresca melodia, quasi con le semplici arti innocenti di un
Mozart — non c'inganni l'accresciuta tavolozza orchestrale, che il
Mascagni ha riempito di colori fisicamente più abbaglianti di quelli
mozartiani — allora solo noi sentiamo che la sua tecnica orchestrale
raggiunge la sua giusta misura.[15]

  [14] Esempî lampanti di derivazione schumanniana troviamo in molte
  parti dell'opera mascagnana, e non solo nel tecnicismo, ma pur nel
  contenuto. Si ricordi il movimento della descrizione di vita
  londinese nel 1º atto del _Ratcliff_, così somigliante al n. 13
  delle _Davidbündlerlänze_.

  [15] Nascerebbe in me, discorrendo questi argomenti, di
  specificare come la pura tradizione, sulla cui via si trovano
  Haydn Mozart Beethoven Berlioz Schumann, debba da noi altri
  italiani esser ripresa e non come servile infeconda imitazione. Ma
  questo libro è uno studio critico, non una raccolta di programmi.
  Certo che servirà a illuminare anche lo svolgimento delle mie tesi
  critiche sul Mascagni il dire che, allontanandoci da Wagner, il
  nostro ravvicinamento a Beethoven dovrebb'essere, per dir così,
  bene auspicato da una riverente preghiera al genio tutelare di
  Monteverdi. Ma tutto sta che — per uscire d'immagini — il preteso
  ritorno a Monteverdi e ai fraterni musicisti del 500-600-700 non
  sia... wagnerizzamento delle loro forme e contenuti — come, a un
  dipresso, per Rameau e Monteverdi, accade nel movimento francese
  moderno, col quale noi coincidiamo per quel che riguarda il
  desiderio di reazione al wagnerismo, non per quel che riguarda
  l'attuazione di tale bisogno rivoluzionario.




L'ARMONIZZATORE.


Se nel disegno del precedente capitolo sostituissimo al vocabolo
_orchestrazione_ il vocabolo _armonizzazione_, fatte le debite
modificazioni noi verremmo ad avere il capitolo che ora debbo scrivere.
Infatti, dato che nella considerazione astratta degli elementi tecnici
d'un'arte, in fondo in fondo, ciò che noi contempliamo, è il valore
estetico, la personalità, il contenuto lirico, etc — di un autore o
della serie degli autori; studiando l'armonizzazione p. es. di Mozart,
anche il più arido didatta d'armonia non saprebbe scinderla dal valore
espressivo che essa ha nella sua concreta coesistenza estetica con il
contenuto. Onde ciò che dissi intorno ad una possibile e per ora
mancante storia della orchestrazione, potrebbe ripetersi per una
altrettanto possibile che mancante storia dell'armonia. Non che storie
di tale mezzo tecnico dell'espressione musicale — chiamato, assai
ingiustamente scienza, e confusa così con l'acustica colla quale non ha
pur minimamente a che fare — non manchino. Anche la musica ha i suoi
glottologi. Ma essi — gli armonisti — sono più vicini ai catalogatori di
voci per vocabolari, che a veri e propri glottologi consci che la
trasformazione del segno non va staccata dalla trasformazione del
contenuto.

Come la tecnica strumentale, la tecnica armonica ha dunque una storia,
che a rigore dovrebbe prendere i suoi inizi... dal canto del celeberrimo
primo abitatore del paradiso terrestre, ammesso ch'egli cantasse. Ma noi
ci rifaremo dai tempi molto più vicini e osserveremo come, facendo per
comodo nostro incominciare il _cromatismo_, e cioè quell'astratta
direzione armonica che oggi sembra predominare — predominio che
potrebbesi distruggere, distruggendo la convenzionalità dell'astrazione
— dal Monteverdi e dal Frescobaldi; questo cromatismo è oggi giunto al
suo massimo sviluppo, anzi alla sua corruzione. Infatti il cromatismo
passato attraverso quei punti d'arrivo che sono le opere di un Bach di
un Haydn e di un Mozart giunse al suo più perfetto equilibrio col suo
presunto nemico il _diatonismo_[16] in Beethoven. Al solito dopo
Beethoven noi troviamo il consueto fenomeno di frantumazione in generale
e di biforcazione in particolare: e Riccardo Wagner crea una scuola
armonica a sè della quale oggi sono seguaci volente lo Strauss, nolente,
ma impotente a una ribellione non ispirata agli stessi principi che
reggono l'odiato dispotismo, il Debussy; e lo Schumann crea un'altra
scuola armonica infinitamente più prossima all'armonia beethoveniana. A
questa scuola si avvicinano, incoscienti e per la forza stessa delle
cose, gli italiani, nonchè molti francesi.

  [16] Cromatismo e diatonismo sono, a chi non sappia di musica,
  qualcosa come una rete a maglie più larghe — il diatonismo — e una
  rete a maglie più strette — il cromatismo, delle quali reti non
  solo la larghezza totale è la stessa — scala da _do_ a _do_ — ma
  anche la larghezza delle maglie maggiori è equivalente a un certo
  numero delle minori — do-re = do, re bemolle, re naturale. Per
  uscir di metafora chi potrebbe distinguere rigidamente ciò che
  differenzia l'uso della scala cromatica in Beethoven e in Wagner,
  se non un più o un meno che si rivela a un'indagine più accurata,
  assolutamente scolastico? E in fondo in fondo il famoso diatonismo
  per esser tutto imbastito di necessità sulla scala cromatica, non
  finisce per esser assorbito nel cromatismo? E ciò che sembra
  rimanerne del tutto fuori, non finisce per rivelarsi come o
  differenza di gusto di tutta un'epoca — e quindi diversità di
  contenuto storico-sentimentale — o, addirittura, come _retorica_?

Tra i contemporanei Pietro Mascagni come armonizzatore appare quasi un
diatonico. Infatti a differenza di Strauss e di Debussy — io cito sempre
questi due compositori quali i più significativi della presente epoca di
decadenza musicale — i quali hanno spinto il cromatismo, l'uno fino
all'assurdo, l'altro alla perdita quasi completa (completa non è
possibile umanamente) del senso tonale; unica grande radice dell'armonia
come intuizione estetica contrapposta all'anarchico trastullarsi
infecondo con i mezzi tecnici d'un'arte, divertimento prediletto degli
alessandrini e di tutti i decadenti in generale; il Mascagni è ancora a
quello stato di equilibrio quasi perfetto del cromatismo e del
diatonismo, il quale equilibrio in fondo non significa altro che una
nitidezza, dirò così, omerica dell'intuizione musicale. Occorre però,
come già abbiam fatto per la orchestrazione, distinguere
nell'armonizzazione mascagnana una traccia d'elementi spuri derivati in
essa dall'eterna dominazione wagneriana; traccia che la sua già
largamente dimostrata incoscienza estetica o critica, come la si voglia
dire, ha impedito di eliminare dal suo bel limpido linguaggio italiano
che sarebbe da tale purificazione risultato più terso e consono al
contenuto.

Infatti, per prendere un esempio, chiunque paragoni l'armonia della
_Monferrina_ dell'_Amica_; armonia nella sua chiarezza adamantina non
inferiore al nitidissimo confluire di attrazioni tonali attraverso
spontanee rettilinee divergenze di accordi diatonici e di non meno
spontanee leggiadrissime curve di cromatismi sottili e squisitamente
condotti — proprietà eccellente dello stile armonico mozartiano;
all'armonia tronfia pesante e confusa dell'intermezzo sinfonico che
divide il primo atto dal secondo nella stessa opera, vedrà a sufficienza
quanto sia aliena la _vera_ natura musicale del Mascagni dall'obliquo
cromatismo moderno. A parte l'esagerazione wagneriana del commento
sproporzionato all'azione; armonicamente tale intermezzo, con le sue
goffe e banali successioni di terze maggiori e quinte aumentate, e
l'ansante incalzare di faticose polifonie, che invano tentano placarsi
in qualche episodio di enfatico misticismo armonico, non sembra neppur
scritto dall'autore dell'intermezzo della _Cavalleria_ del _Fritz_ del
_Ratcliff_ e delle danze nelle _Maschere_ e della massima parte
dell'_Iris_, l'opera che anche sotto questo aspetto resta al disopra di
tutto ciò che finora ha scritto Mascagni. Infatti ciò che armonicamente
era in germe nella _Cavalleria_ e nell'_Amico Fritz_[17] di
originalmente continuante alcune delle più schiette tradizioni della
semplicità e chiarezza armonica italiana, nell'_Iris_ prende una forma
definitiva e, a suo modo, possente. Certo l'armonizzazione totale
dell'_Iris_ è inquinata dal wagnerismo degli episodi dei fiori,
dell'aurora, del sole nell'_inno al sole_ e quindi di gran parte
dell'ultim'atto, sebbene il wagnerismo dell'_Iris_ sia infinitamente più
simpatico di quello dell'_Amica_, penetrando in esso quasi il calore
della fantasia alacre che riscalda giocondamente tutto lo spartito. Ma
l'armonia dell'episodio delle lavandare, del teatrino, di quasi tutto il
second'atto in cui rifulge la squisitezza armonica dell'_aria della
piovra_ e, nell'ultim'atto, del brano dei cenciaioli, è preziosa quanto
la italianamente elegante armonia dell'_Otello_ verdiano, alla quale si
ricollegano le correnti non wagneriane derivate da Beethoven, che anche
armonicamente è, come dissi già, più mediterraneo che nordico e in
particolare, la corrente schumanniana, lo Schumann essendo certo uno
degli armonizzatori più sapienti e eleganti che abbia mai avuto la
musica.

  [17] L'_Amico Fritz_ si collega anche — ed è ciò altra conferma
  alla sua essenza armonica — alla musica popolare slava.

Ma per un altro aspetto l'armonia dell'_Iris_ è importante. Ho già detto
che nel Mascagni — e dovrei dire: nella parte vitale dell'opera
mascagnana — trionfa un latino equilibrio tra il diatonismo e il
cromatismo. Se non che se il cromatismo per sua natura è, per così dire,
immutabile, non potendo mai modificarsi la scala cromatica, essendo
ormai quasi direi impietrita nella tastiera degli strumenti, il
diatonismo può continuamente cangiare, potendosi a piacere — certo non
ad arbitrio — mutare nella serie cromatica dei semitoni la posizione dei
toni formanti una scala diatonica. Così se le vecchie scale diatoniche
erano: _do_, _re_, _mi_, _fa_, _sol_, _la_, _si_, e _do_, _re_, _mi b_,
_fa_, _sol_, _la b_, _si_, è naturale che, le scale diatoniche oggi in
cui l'orecchio è stato reso più sottile ed acuto dal cromatismo, si
moltiplichino in un modo prima insospettato. In altre parole dal caotico
oceano del cromatismo frenetico della musica modernissima, sta per
emergere un nuovo diatonismo, non limitato a due scale solamente, come
avvenne da Bach a Wagner, ma aperto a innumerevoli novissime
combinazioni. Il senso tonale trasformato se non perfezionato dovrà
condurre di nuovo la musica a un _ordine_, complesso sì, ma limpido e
ben equilibrato, contro al quale sembrano adoprarsi pazzescamente le
oziose ricerche armoniche di tanta musica modernissima. Se la vecchia
determinazione «melodia» può ancora avere un significato, non
contrapposto insulsamente ad _armonia_, ma da questa rampollante, è
precisamente in relazione col nuovo diatonismo, come del resto anche
prima era in relazione con l'antico diatonismo; e cioè melodia vorrà
dire linea sonora passante per i toni (meglio i gradi) dei nuovi modi
diatonici emergenti dal disfacimento del cromatismo post-wagneriano.

Ora nel Mascagni il diatonismo della _Cavalleria_, del _Fritz_ e del
_Ratcliff_ appartiene al vecchio tipo bachiano-wagneriano, mentre il
diatonismo dell'_Iris_, nella massima parte almeno, appartiene al
novissimo o se non altro lo presente, lo preannunzia (3º atto
dell'_Iris_; canzone del cenciaiuolo e qua e là per tutta l'opera).
Certo in Mascagni neppur di questo bisogno è coscienza esplicita, ma, al
solito, quasi direi un sospetto, un desiderio confuso. Ma questo fatto è
veramente — a chi lo sappia scoprire e interpretare — una delle maggiori
riprove dell'italianità sebbene bastarda, del Mascagni. Che sempre è
stato questo vecchio nostro genio latino che ha precorso tutti, se non
nella risoluzione piena, almeno nell'ingenua impostatura dei più
difficili problemi estetici (e non estetici!). Non ostante la mancanza
perpetua di libertà, che come una triste ombra ancora del passato si
proietta sul popolo italiano, è sempre questo da cui partono i baleni
delle nuove aurore nell'ansietà delle tenebre invadenti. Il nuovo
diatonismo,[18] l'ordine nel caos cromatico, la salda base
dell'intuizione musicale, il rinnovamento del senso tonale, è forse uno
dei problemi dalla cui risoluzione maggiormente dipendono le sorti della
musica europea. Chè, in verità, troppo sterili ed oziosi sono i
tentativi degli _impressionisti_ musicali francesi, i quali oltre al
partirsi da un errore estetico; oltre al non superare affatto il
wagnerismo delle cui formule descrittive l'impressionismo è l'estrema
emanazione; oltre al trasformare in musica il contenuto morale della
poesia e della pittura dei così detti decadenti, e quindi al non
rinnovare affatto il contenuto storico della loro arte, secondo quella
perpetua legge per cui i musicisti si contentano sempre dei resti del
banchetto già consumato dai despoti della cultura europea — qui in
Italia abbiamo il d'Annunzio, che comincia tardivamente a riempire di sè
anche la musica —; non raggiungono miglior risultato e più concreto del
dare per intuizione artistica ciò che non è che inconcludente trastullo
di combinazioni armoniche, a cui venga imposto arbitrariamente un
significato descrittivo. Onde non è senza un certo orgoglio sereno che
io proclamo apparire in Mascagni i segni d'una rinascita, il
presentimento d'una nuova melodicità latina e, cioè, di un nuovo
diatonismo. Se non che questo pregio, che una volta di più si può e si
deve concedere agli Italiani, e cioè quello di _precorrere_ per certa
nazionale spontaneità del nostro genio, deve appunto procurarci un
orgoglio _sereno_, non fanatico e cieco: infatti io ripeterò le parole
del Foscolo: «o Italiani! qual popolo più di noi può lodarsi dei
benefizi della natura? ma chi più di noi (nè dissimulerò ciò che
sembrami vero, quando l'occasione mi comanda di palesarlo) chi più di
noi trascura e profonde quei benefizi? A che vi querelate se i germi
dell'italiano sapere sono coltivati dagli stranieri che ve li
usurpano?». E, a terminare, citerò le parole d'un altro grande italiano,
Bertrando Spaventa, le quali, per essere scritte sulle condizioni
d'un'attività che gl'italiani ebbero in comune con i tedeschi — la
filosofia —; le sorti della filosofia italiana e della tedesca essendo
intrecciate in modo analogo alle sorti della musica italiana e della
tedesca; possono esser citate tanto per la filosofia che per la musica.
«Che se noi, egli scrive, vogliamo ancora e possiamo avere un
privilegio, questo è quello di precorrere ed effettuare un più largo
indirizzo... Ma ciò a un patto; e questo è di non rigettare tutto quel
che si è fatto da un gran pezzo fuori d'Italia o meglio che in Italia,
ma studiarlo, comprenderlo, appropriarcelo; e solo così, entrati in più
largo orizzonte, conosciuto meglio noi medesimi e ritemprata la nostra
vita nella perpetua corrente della vita universale, fare un gran passo
innanzi non nel vuoto, ma con la piena coscienza delle nostre forze, del
nostro compito, del compito comune». Parole che fanno fremere come una
sinfonia di Beethoven.

  [18] In questo modo, e cioè col vecchio diatonismo, il ritorno al
  quale è il più antipatico anacronismo linguistico di cui si sia
  servita la retorica umana per rattristare i veri artisti, si
  spiega la ribellione alla melodia da parte delle scuole musicali
  più avanzate d'oggidì. In un certo senso, sotto il punto di vista
  armonico, ogni melodia dev'essere la scoperta d'una nuova
  combinazione tonale, al modo stesso che ogni nuova intuizione
  poetica sarà di necessità la creazione d'una formula grammaticale
  nuova e impreveduta. Niente è più inutile d'un motivo di
  Meyerbeer, niente più inutile del sonetto d'un prete di provincia
  imitatore dei classici; sebbene in Meyerbeer ci sia una scaltrezza
  d'arrivista che nel prete provinciale difetta, il paragone è
  calzantissimo. Certo la nausea della melodia _che concede comoda
  al vulgo i flosci fianchi_ può degenerare in libidine impotente di
  novità; ma se i limiti della melodicità ondeggiano tra le melodie
  d'un Petrella e _La Mer_ di Claudio Debussy, ossia tra
  l'affermazione vuota e la negazione vuota, non ha da inferirne che
  non sia possibile anche criticamente dire quali dovranno essere le
  forme concrete e sincere della melodia.




CONCLUSIONE.


Chi m'ha potuto seguire fin qui — e dico così, giacchè spiriti altissimi
a comprendere il valore della mia discussione dal punto di vista teorico
si trovano per certo ora tra i così detti critici letterari, ma, almeno
qui in Italia detti spiriti sono, ohimè, quasi sempre sprovvisti di sia
pur rudimentale educazione del gusto musicale; e, per converso, gli
spiriti educati alla musica non sono, ohimè, capaci di comprendere una
seria argomentazione critica; chi, dunque, ha potuto seguirmi fin qui,
avrà notato come la mia affermazione dell'arte mascagnana è per così
dire tutta intessuta di negazioni. E realmente, ripeto per riepilogare i
punti principali del mio studio, il Mascagni rispetto ai grandi
musicisti del passato appare un ben piccolo compositore d'opere
popolaresche. Ma sta appunto in questa sua ingenuità di popolo la
ragione _estetica_ per cui io lo difendo e lo _oso_ contrapporre a
musicisti di contenuto più dignitoso — in apparenza — del suo. Io so già
lo scandalo che sto per suscitare con l'audacia della mia tesi a doppio
taglio; all'estero essa parrà un sacrilegio; in Italia una bestemmia, se
non addirittura un'offesa al popolo italiano, dimostrando piccolo non
solo il contenuto dell'opera mascagnana, ma ancora il contenuto
dell'opera tutta ottocentesca italiana. Insomma il mio povero libro non
piacerà nè a Dio, nè al diavolo. E s'aggiunga, ribatto ancora,
l'impossibilità che la maggior parte dei miei lettori ha di comprendermi
interamente, i colti non essendo severamente musicisti, i musicisti non
essendo severamente colti.

Che devo farci? Scrivere un altro libro sopra Debussy e Strauss, con il
qual libro certo completerei ed esaurirei la _mia_ critica sopra la
musica contemporanea? Ciò potrò anche farlo. Per ora basti a quei
pochissimi che m'abbiano letto con «eros», il vedere in iscorcio quello
che potrebbe essere l'ossatura del libro futuro, di cui, in fondo,
questo sul Mascagni non sarebbe che un libro complementare.

L'arte modernissima a cominciare dal Wagner per finire al d'Annunzio ha
in sè un elemento estra estetico, che io chiamerei una specie di stimolo
alla vita, o una specie di nepente per dimenticarla. Tale arte è
generalmente fatta _da_ e _per_ uomini deboli, stanchi,
irrimediabilmente sciupati. I loro spiriti invece di volere dall'artista
una visione e una contemplazione, esigono quasi un'eccitazione,
un'ubbriacatura, sia pure d'indole assolutamente cerebrale.

Gli artisti che soddisfano questa innumerevole famiglia di debilitati —
si pensi ai pubblici decadenti dei massimi teatri europei — si possono
così dividere in due grandi categorie: spiriti idillici — un pò nel
senso desanctissiano[19] — che vanno cercando una gocciolina di
freschezza e d'ingenuità analoga alla pastoralità del secento, e
colorando tale nostalgica freschezza della loro melanconia spesso
ironica, ad es: tra gli italiani, Guido Gozzano, tra gli stranieri,
Claude Debussy. Oppure, spiriti dionisiaci — un pò nel senso
nietzschiano — che cercano nascondere la rovina su cui danzano al ritmo
della loro povera follia con un rabbioso furore di baccanale. Esemplare
di questa seconda categoria può prendersi la parte falsa dell'opera
d'annunziana e tutta l'opera dello Strauss. Ecco perchè al sereno
spettatore moderno dei fenomeni estetici europei balenano spesso i più
meravigliosi errori contradittori di giudizio che si possano sognare.
C'è chi vede in Debussy un prodigioso rifiorimento d'ingenuità e di
semplicità intima, e non s'accorge, malato del male comune, quanto suoni
falsa e spasmodica tale presunta freschezza e semplicità. Altri invece
scorgerà in Debussy un sorriso ambiguo di femmina logorata dal vizio, e
pronuncia a suo modo un giudizio giustissimo. Di Riccardo Strauss c'è
chi giura trattarsi di una vitalità superba, multiforme, superiore anche
alla irruente vitalità wagneriana — anche questo giudizio è parzialmente
vero. Ma ci sarà altri che invece troverà nello Strauss un ammasso vuoto
e _frigido_ sebbene assordante di polifonie e confuse di armonie
pazzesche.

  [19] V. lo studio sul Leopardi e sul Petrarca.

La ragione di questa parallela duplicità di giudizii sta nel fatto che
ho sopradetto. L'arte di costoro è più un eccitante o un calmante che
una vera contemplazione o sintesi estetica delle proprie emozioni, anzi,
come tutti gli stimolanti è composta per lo più ad _artificio_, è
l'innaturalezza di ciò che serve a continuare e a intensificare uno
stato patologico.

Non rechi quindi troppo stupore a quei pochi che saranno in grado di
capirmi senza bigottismi e senza dispregi fuor di luogo, se io oso
parlare di un Pietro Mascagni e più, di studiarlo con amore, rilevandone
in mezzo alle difettosità, alle sciatterie e alle contaminazioni
estranee, i brani di buona e bella naturalezza e vera ingenuità. Se
nelle opere dei reputati maggiori c'è oggi meno che la vita, nel nostro
buon Mascagni, c'è veramente della vita quell'inimitabile baleno, quel
divino risopianto che ci trasporta nelle opere di un Mozart e di un
Beethoven. È una vita rudimentale, popolaresca come dirsi, una vita che
ci auguriamo sia presto superata ed obliata per ben altri canti
altrettanto schietti e sinceri ma profondi e pesanti di vera altissima
conoscenza umana. Ma mi sia permesso affermare, ad onta dell'apparenza
paradossale di ciò che affermo, che, presentemente, chi sia _davvero_
puro, e non _per moda_ nauseato dalle malaticcie raffinatezze di Debussy
e dagli spasimi sadistici di Riccardo Strauss; se non si rassegni
tristemente a chiudersi nel passato, ma voglia godere d'un poco di vita
sempre viva, sia pure inferiormente italiana; non abbia altro scampo che
dissetarsi alla vena zampillante d'una bella melodia di Pietro Mascagni.

  Qual è il significato vero dell'opera di questo o quel poeta e
  artista italiano, nostro contemporaneo? Qual è il pensiero
  originale di questo o quel filosofo? E l'idea dominante di questo
  o quello storico? E l'indirizzo politico, in cui ha lavorato
  questo o quell'uomo di governo, agitatore, pubblicista? Che cosa
  sono stati tutti codesti uomini nella nostra anima e vita
  nazionale, quali voci hanno portato, quali trasformazioni di
  attività hanno prodotto?

  A tali domande, e ad altre più modeste: — Quando e dove
  precisamente sono nati? Tra quali circostanze si sono formati?
  Quale è la serie cronologica dei loro scritti e del loro atti? —
  risponderà la nostra collezione dei _Contemporanei d'Italia_; a
  somiglianza delle altre straniere, francesi e tedesche, ma, a
  differenza di quelle, con intenti più severi di scelta e di
  metodo. Essa escluderà personaggi, che hanno notorietà ma valgono
  poco; e includerà, invece, anche uomini dimenticati o trascurati,
  che hanno avuto un proprio pensiero e spiegato un'effettiva
  azione: lascerà da parte gli aneddoti, e mirerà all'essenziale.

  Gli studi, che pubblicheremo, non saranno apologie, ma neppure
  libelli: saranno storia. Non nasconderanno i difetti e gli errori
  degli uomini, presi a studiare; ma intendono guardare, sopratutto,
  all'opera positiva, da ciascuno di essi compiuta.

  Ogni volumetto sarà preceduto da un ritratto, talvolta anche da un
  autografo, e sempre seguito da una bibliografia (completa degli
  scritti, e sommaria della letteratura critica intorno a essi),
  quando si tratti di scrittori; da un catalogo di opere o da una
  cronologia, se si tratti di artisti o di uomini d'azione.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

                    _TO MY FRIEND AND COLLEAGUE,
                           JAMES HUNEKER._


_Dear James_:

  _Beside the ebon Styx
    The brood harmonious wanders slow.
  A backward gaze on earth they fix,
    And ask, "Where doth dear Music go?"_

  _I fancy Palestrina stares,
    And good Scarlatti gasps for breath,
  While Handel, with his figured airs,
    Bemoans poor Music's early death._

  _Old Haydn shakes his long peruke,
    And Mozart wags his pendant cue,
  As both record their soft rebuke:
    "What is it that these moderns do?"_

  _Alone in all that troubled throng
    One moves with calm, unruffled brow;
  For still Sebastian's voice is strong
    To say, "'Twas I who taught them how."_

  _So when the storms discordant brew,
    You smile at me across the house;
  For well you know there's nothing new,
    Not even (pardon!) in your Strauss._

  _Except, perhaps, a fine disguise
    Of leading motives, wood and strings,
  Which make a score look wondrous wise,
    And seem to mean to many things._

  _So weave your fancies; I'll weave mine;
    And let them wander, dark or bright.
  The Lords of Art have graven fine;
    Perchance we both discern aright._

  _W. J. H._

                             PARSIFALIA


                  I.--A PURE FOOL IN THE NEW WORLD

                                The Holy Grail!--I trust
                          We are green in heaven's eyes.

                                  TENNYSON, _The Holy Grail_.

It was the night before Christmas. The city of Gotham was surfeited
with the vast spectacle of wealth in its annual orgy of expenditure.
Women had careered madly through the savings of a twelvemonth;
and desperate husbands, driven almost to the abyss of insanity,
had plunged blindly into the vortex of buying, and mortgaged the
labor of the next half-year. It was the merry Yule-tide, when every
self-respecting New Yorker feels that it is incumbent upon him to
assume a bank account, if he have it not, and to buy for his neighbor
Christmas gifts more expensive than the neighbor can buy for him.

On the eve of Christmas Day it seemed as if half the city had turned
to its last madness, for Wagner's "Parsifal," torn from the holy
seclusion of Baireuth by the ruthless hand of an American showman
(from Vienna), was produced at the Metropolitan Opera-House for the
first time in the New World. The fiat had gone forth that all prices
of admission were to be doubled at the box office; and it was no
secret that sidewalk venders of tickets were charging five times
the figures nominated in the bond. It had been made known that the
performance would begin at five of the clock in the afternoon, and
that after the first act there would be an intermission of nearly two
hours for rest and refreshment.

Restaurateurs in the neighborhood of the opera-house had sung their
"Laus Deo" and marked up their schedule of charges. Society had been
vainly interrogated by reporters as to how it intended to dress for a
solemn festival, split between afternoon and evening. Trumpeters had
been secured to blow selected motives to warn the faithful to their
seats, and it had been published in very large type that against the
singers engaged in the production had been launched the curse of
Wahnfried. Nothing had been neglected that might add fresh fire to
the flaming fever of extravagance.

At the appointed hour the ceremonial of the intoning of the motives
was performed, and a little later the curtains swung wide to disclose
the sylvan retreat near the Castle of Monsalvat. The deed was
accomplished. The black Alberich of the Yankee ooze had wrested from
its Baireuth bed the Rheingold of the Wagner family, and the gods of
the Wahnfried hearthstone shivered in their Dämmerung.

A vast and strange assemblage sat in bewildered silence at the
performance, and, having heard the martial pæans of much free
advertising, went away thrilled with the belief that it had assisted
at the introduction to America of the "masterpiece" of Wagner. O ye
Norse gods and little fish-maidens! There was a Wagner once--but no
matter.

What kind of impression did this drama make upon the unprejudiced
and equipoised mind? What is the real truth about this huge ragoût
of mysticism and orchestration which in the looming shadows of the
Festspielhaus is called "sacred"? The story of "Parsifal" has been
told over and over again. The themes are becomingly catalogued in the
handbooks of Wolzogen, Heinz, and Kufferath. The very boarding-school
girls smirk at one another as they hum "Der Reine Thor," and
rosy-cheeked boys can whistle the Klingsor theme. There is no need to
rehearse here either the story or the music. But let us come at once
to some conclusions drawn from a cool, dispassionate study of a dozen
performances of "Parsifal" beyond the factitious influences created
by the Baireuth exaltation.

"Parsifal" is the child of Wagner's artistic decrepitude. It is a
decrescendo in inspiration, a ritardando in invention. More than any
other drama of Wagner does it rely upon the dazzling of the eye to
dull the keenness of the musical ear. It is a most imposing pageant
set to unimposing music. Wagner fired heaven once with the immolation
of Brünnhilde. It was not to be done again. The light on the Holy
Grail is white and cold.

The entire machinery of the familiar Wagnerian drama is here; but
the scene painter, the stage manager, the mechanician, and the
electrician bravely hold up the hands of the musician. Cast any aged
rags of scenery on the stage; let the lights be as dim and flickering
as the dying fancies of Adrian; let the actors be of the breed of
the subsidized provincial German theatre, and yet the last act of
"Tristan und Isolde" will peal its eloquence into the heart and blast
the soul with the lightnings of genius. Give the first act of "Die
Walküre," most hackneyed of all great acts, the tottering timbers of
battered scenes, a moonlight of such Prussian blue as never was on
sea or land, and still the might and power of its pulsating passion
will conquer.

But strip "Parsifal" of its scenic and mechanic glories, and you
will lay bare the skeleton of a system with only a few shreds of the
flesh left upon it. The poem of "Parsifal" is almost utterly devoid
of those great basic elements which make human life dramatic for men
and women. Nowhere in it do we see, as in Wagner's other works, the
primeval man and woman at gaze upon each other in the naked barbaric
splendor of desire. Instead of the one passion which makes plays, we
are asked to consider the suffering of a man who is as remote from
our common sympathies as his figure is from our eyes when it lies
recumbent in the seat behind the altar of the Grail.

Amfortas is held up as typical of the sufferings of humanity under
the curse of carnal sin. Tannhäuser is more eloquent than a thousand
of him. We see Tannhäuser in the grip of the temptress; of the sin
of Amfortas we hear talk, talk, talk; while the sufferer himself is
carried about upon a litter,--a charnel-house sight,--making his
unending moan to the patient stars.

The hero of the story, young Parsifal, comes before us looking like
young Siegfried and wearing a musical tag of similar style. In
the last act he is bearded and armored, again like Siegfried, and
his theme is exfoliated in an umbrageous harmony of trumpets and
trombones. But what a tenuous echo he is, after all! Siegfried blazes
with all the glory of manhood: he has hot blood in his veins; and he
carves his way through fire and the wrath of a god to the mountain of
his heart's desire.

Parsifal loves no woman. He cannot, for he is the embodiment of
ascetic, or at least monastic, denial. The one emotion which he
submits for our hearts is pity, a most excellent emotion and admitted
to be akin to love. A highly respected sister-in-law of love it may
be; but love is love, and spins the big round world down the grooves
of time.

As an ethical basis of this drama, we are asked to accept a
philosophy of pity, founded on the ethics of Arthur Schopenhauer and
amplified by the adoption of certain of the teachings of Buddha.
Instead of those beautiful doctrines of redemption through the
love and self-sacrifice of woman, so eloquently preached in some
of Wagner's other dramas, we are besought to look upon woman as a
temptress, and renunciation of love as the highway to heaven.

As the exemplar of the claim of pity, we are presented with
the picture of the wounded Amfortas, who is a lay figure of
incomprehensible personality. He is shown in the first act, and the
pity doctrine is further preached in the pother made over the killing
of the swan (such a big, fat, able-bodied swan!). As the master of
evil we behold Klingsor, who comes before us in the first scene of
the second act with more paraphernalia of slate-green walls, blue
smoke, and exclamatory incantations than Faust ever had in his salad
days at the Paris Grand Opera.

Kundry, the only woman in the play, is an ill-made muddle of
inhumanity, who never commands a single instant of sympathy. She
strives by service to atone for her sins, which are committed under
the spell of Klingsor. She has neither love nor passion. Gurnemanz,
the aged knight, is a wearisome talker. He tells the story of his
life or any one else's life to whomsoever will listen. The audience
cannot escape.

With the exception of Klingsor and his "flower-girls"--a charming
euphemism--these puppets are shown to us in the first scene, in which
the necessary explanations are made in long-winded speeches, mostly
by Gurnemanz, seated on a rock and reciting like weary Wotan in Act
II. of "Die Walküre." When this doddering graphophone comes to lead
Parsifal to the castle of the Grail, Wagner sorts over his old plans
and specifications and selects Siegfried's Rhine Journey.

But this time it is a sedate and pious progress finishing with bells
and chorals. Nevertheless, it is one of the fine spots in the work.
When the bells are in tune, it is imposing. The scenery changes in an
ingenious and effective panorama.

Then comes the crown of the act and the noblest scene in the
work,--the unveiling of the Grail and the ceremony of the Last
Supper. This is not the time for a discussion of the propriety of
putting such matters on the stage. Suffice it to say, that here
Wagner has accomplished one of the most triumphant demonstrations of
the effectiveness of his organic union of the arts tributary to the
drama. Music, text, action, scenic form and color, all work together
in an irresistibly potent symphony of symbolism, which no reverent
man can hear and see without emotion. It makes "Parsifal" almost
persuasive.

The second act opens with the exhibition of Klingsor, as already
noted. He is as unreal as the purple light which illumines Kundry
when he summons her from the trapdoor in the stage. She rises like
Mother Erda in "Siegfried," Act III., but, oh, so different! Away
with such cheap and paltry claptrap as this scene! Poor Wagner, he
had to write it to explain himself; and in "Parsifal" he needed a lot
of explanation. Not all the Ellises nor Wolzogens in the world could
blot out the Drury Lane stain of this one scene. Even the exclamatory
"Ha, ha!" of the time-dishonored stage villain is not spared us.

The second scene of the act is the magic garden of flower-maidens,
Venusberg, No. 2. No. 1 is much better, both dramatically and
musically. This one is "Tannhäuser" and water, and very poor water
at that. Yet it is the scene which will please the populace most,
when the flower-girls are pretty and graceful, for their music is
languorous and suggestive of Leo Delibes raised to the seventh power.

But there is nothing human in this whole scene. Kundry, unlike
Venus, does not love the man she tempts. Venus is at the heart a
passionate, despairing woman. Kundry is the deputed and bewitched
instrument of a Wahnfried Cagliostro. Her deed is that of a woman of
the pavement; her extenuation the pitiful and transparent fact that
she plies her trade in a trance and under an irresistible spell. We
see her put in the trance; we see her come out of it. Before and
after it she is a rough and revolting yokel with tangled black locks
and a gunny bag for her garb. In the trance she is transformed by the
power of the magician to a beautiful blonde in a diaphanous décolleté
gown.

The symbolism of the whole scene is weak and tottering. The logic of
the enlightenment of Parsifal by the long-drawn kiss with wind and
string accompaniment (see "Siegfried," Act III.) is beyond finite
conception. The symbolism of the waking of a sleeping Valkyr maiden
by the first kiss of love is something that even the most hardened
society woman might understand; but the employment of a courtesan's
salute to enlighten a pure fool by pity is a device which swings
futile between heaven and earth.

The last act is a flat desert of tedium, with oases of musical
verdure. Gurnemanz has more opportunities to lecture on Amfortas,
Good Friday, and similar topics, but even with the aid of Wagner's
own musical illustrations he is uninteresting. The foot-washing
episode is a pitiable and shocking plagiarism from the life of
Christ. The central figure, with its beard, its long hair, and its
light-tinted robe, is so like the Good Shepherd of the paintings that
it suggests an automaton replica. And this is all so inessential. It
is dragged in to give the thing a sacred atmosphere.

The really beautiful places in the first scene of the last act are
the splendid proclamation of the Grail theme after the baptism of
Parsifal--one of the few bursts of power which recall the Wagner of
"Die Walküre"--and the ineffably lovely peacefulness of the Good
Friday music. This indeed is an inspired page in the score; but it
was written twenty-five years before the drama was produced.

The final scene is a weak and diluted repetition of the second scene
of the first act. This time Parsifal unveils the Grail. The music
is necessarily built of the same materials. It does not achieve its
effect. Neither is the pictorial impression as deep. We have seen
it all before. The gorgeous, pealing brass passage at the second
entrance to the Grail hall is the most muscular thing in the whole
act, but it stands by itself. It seems to have no logical place in
the musical scheme.

The score of this drama is mostly a long, faint echo of Wagner's
greatest works. Siegfried vainly strives to animate this Parsifalian
puppet of renunciation with the blood of the Volsung woe. Cloudlike
shreds of "Tristan und Isolde" struggle to float sunset tints across
this pallid sky. All is copying, futile, without inspiration,
without newness,--a hotch-potch of the old marketable materials made
over with much constructive skill, but with commercial thrift and
inartistic insincerity. There is hardly a note of honest æsthetic
conviction in the whole thing. One is inclined to think that Wagner
did not believe in it himself.

These, then, are the conclusions gathered from performances in
a common opera-house of Wagner's religious, symbolical, ethical,
philosophical, and highly gilded summary of his artistic creed. When
this work is played in Baireuth, where churchly airs are assumed
and the people robe their spirits in sackcloth and ashes, the
impression is different. But now that "Parsifal" has come out into
the light of morning and faced the cold glare of the work-day world,
it must be measured by the artistic standards which are applied to
Wagner's other dramas. Weighed in the balance with "Tristan und
Isolde" or any of the "Ring" works, except perhaps "Rheingold," to
which it is artistically not a stranger, it must be found wanting.
Beside "Tannhäuser," which treats the same subject, it is a mass of
glittering artificialities. Wagner was wise in wishing that this
drama should be preserved for home consumption.




                      II.--ETHICS AND ÆSTHETICS

    The cut nails of machine divinity may be driven in, but they
    won't clinch.

                             OLIVER WENDELL HOLMES,
              _The Professor at the Breakfast Table_, Ch. IV.


There was no question that Gotham--wicked, wayward Gotham--was much
stirred up by this production. It was generally accepted as a kind
of religious ceremony, as to which no right-minded gentleman should
deliver himself of critical comment. Yet there were some picturesque
exceptions to the general state. A few ministers of the Gospel sprang
to the pulpit or the interviewer, and descanted in glowing terms on
the outrageous irreligion of the thing, or rather on the sacrilege of
the representation by "painted actors" of incidents in the life of
Christ. Of course these gentlemen had not taken the trouble to study
the work in the original, and some of them showed conclusively that
they were utterly ignorant of it.

But this chanced to be one of those cases in which the pulpit is not
immune. The ignorance of the reverend utterers of sweeping statements
was blithely exposed by some of the men whose business it has been
for many years to study the works of Wagner. Let us, then, in all
justice and humility, with due observance of the Grail adorers on the
one side and the objecting pulpit orators on the other, ask ourselves
how much of real Christianity is disclosed in "Parsifal." How much
more of German mystic philosophy, of mediævalism, of the teachings of
Siddartha, and lastly of pure paganism? What is this work, after all,
but a summary of the blind gropings of the imaginative Wagner after a
philosophy beyond his reach?

Why all this pother about the sacrilege of putting the Holy Grail on
the stage? Was there ever a Holy Grail? Is the green glass chalice
which now reposes peacefully in Genoa a holy vessel? Did the blood of
Christ ever sanctify it? Did Joseph of Arimathea catch the precious
drops in it; and was it really the vessel used at the Last Supper of
Jesus and his apostles?

The ceremony of the Last Supper is unquestionably represented in a
crude manner in Wagner's drama, where it is mixed with a pictorial
representation of the legendary tale that the Christians may make
objection with good ground. The place which the communion occupies in
the ceremonies of the Church is such that to see it made part of a
public theatrical performance, no matter how solemn, or how artistic,
or how honest in its purpose to treat holy things reverentially, must
be repugnant to every Christian mind.

As to this, nothing more need be said. Of the effect of the
representation on an audience there can be no doubt. It is impressive
in the highest degree. The emotions caused by the unveiling scene are
a tribute to the power of theatrical art. But let it be thoroughly
understood that the stage picture and the music are the most
influential elements. Taking that scene as a point of suggestion,
let us ask ourselves how much of real Christianity there is in
"Parsifal." Let us examine the ethics of the drama and probe its
philosophy.

The doctrine of enlightenment by pity, preached so insistently in
this drama, has no relation to Christianity. The religion of Jesus
Christ knows of but one enlightenment, that by faith. It is "he that
believeth," not he that pitieth. The enlightenment of faith enables
the Christian to conceive God. But what do we find in "Parsifal"?
A man has committed a mortal sin, in that he has fallen from that
state of personal chastity in which the servants of the Holy Grail
are required to live. The outward and visible sign of his fall is
an immediate physical (with accompanying spiritual) punishment,
inflicted by the impious hand of the Tempter himself.

Here Wagner follows the story as told by Chrétien des Troyes, and
not the version of Wolfram von Eschenbach. Chrétien made the spear
that with which Longinus pierced the side of the Saviour. Wolfram
made it simply a poisoned lance. Wagner accepted the sacred spear,
because he was always an eager searcher after ethical significance,
even when there was less virtue in it than there is in this one. The
wound of the sacred lance is more than physical; it is a mortal hurt
of the soul. Wagner tells us that for such a wound there can be but
one cure, a touch of the selfsame lance in the hands of one who has
successfully withstood the temptation to which the sufferer fell a
victim.

Very well. There is absolutely no authority for such a conclusion.
It is a bit of mediæval religious mysticism, an adaptation of the
fabulous miracles. Wagner, however, has a right to manufacture
miracles for a fabulous story. He has as much right to do it in
the tale of the Holy Grail as he had in the matter of Hagen's
wonder-working beverages in "Götterdämmerung."

But when he tells us that the reason for Parsifal's action is
enlightenment by pity, he goes still farther away from the dogmas
and doctrines of Christianity and moves through the philosophy of
Arthur Schopenhauer toward the religion of the Buddha. It is a grave
error to relegate to a secondary place the influence of Schopenhauer
on Wagner and to credit the poet-composer with a direct entry into
the teachings of the Gautama. We must bear in mind continually that
Wagner got from Schopenhauer two great doctrines, one artistic, and
the other ethical.

Schopenhauer propounded as the basis of his æsthetic system the
theorem that it is the business of art to represent to us the eternal
essence of things by means of prototypes. The conditions of time
and place, cause and tendency, must be cleared away, and the naked
Eternal Idea underneath disclosed. The discernment and revelation of
this Idea are the duty and privilege of art.

Wagner, then, sought to set forth his personages and their actions
as symbolical. They were to be visual embodiments of Eternal Ideas.
Amfortas is the sinner in the agony of his punishment. Parsifal
is the savior, the pure one who can redeem; Klingsor is the evil
one, and Kundry the unwilling slave of his power. If here we find
ourselves involved in some contradictions, let us be patient.
Wagner's logic is that of a poet and a musician. It will not stand
the test of the metaphysician.

But to resume. The ethical doctrine which the composer obtained from
Schopenhauer was more significant in its results. Schopenhauer's
philosophic system need not be set forth here. Suffice it to say that
ethically its only possible outcome was negative. The world is so bad
that the chief end of man should be to get out of it.

To reach the state of mind in which that end is the chief object,
one must rid himself of all desire and yearn to arrive at a complete
negation of the will to live. Recall "Tristan und Isolde." The first
step toward the negation of the will to live is perfect sympathy with
suffering. Then comes asceticism, which leads directly away from life
toward a condition of abstraction.

Here the thought touches the monasticism of the early Church and
avows a kinship with the Buddhistic doctrine. Withdrawal from the
world and safety by absorption into the universal unconsciousness
were the Buddhist's hope of peace. But neither Gautama nor
Schopenhauer had any definite, positive reason for this. Here the
early monk, who was looking out for the salvation of his own precious
soul and letting other people's souls take care of themselves, came
nearer to the ideals of Wagner as set forth in "Parsifal."

No, Schopenhauer did not teach Wagner the doctrine of "enlightenment
by pity," for with Schopenhauer pity was not enlightenment, but the
beginning of a personal abstraction. A man was sorry for others
because they were in the world, the very worst place a man could
inhabit. His sensuous nature made him like the things he found here
(such as flower-maidens, for example); and his duty was to mortify
the flesh, get rid of all his mortal appetites, live in asceticism,
and die as soon as possible. Wagner was fond of grafting his own
ideas on the philosophical systems of bigger men than himself. So
he invented this doctrine of enlightenment. How he worked out his
psychologic plan we shall see presently.

No doubt Wagner had his eye on Buddhism when he wrote "Parsifal."
It is history that he once contemplated a Buddhistic drama, called
"The Victors," in which he was to preach the doctrine of fleshly
renunciation and salvation through the mortification of desire. But
he abandoned the scheme. The story was Eastern, and he did some
delving in Oriental literature.

How the "Four Sublime Verities" of Gautama, the founder of the
Buddhistic religion, must have appealed to him! These were, first,
that pain exists; second, that the cause of pain is desire or
attachment; third, that pain can be ended by Nirvana; and fourth, how
to attain Nirvana.

The way to Nirvana is hard, much harder than the path to the
Christian Heaven, for the man must walk it without aid. There is no
vicarious sacrifice in the religion of Siddartha. You must walk the
wine-press alone, and drink of the dregs of life. All the best of the
Ten Commandments are found in the precepts of this religion. Added to
them are minor commands looking to complete abstraction.

For example, a Bhikshu (an order of monk) is forbidden to look at
or converse with a woman lest emotion should disturb the serene
indifference of his soul. He must not even save his mother if she is
drowning, except with a long stick reached toward her.

"To sit in solemn silence in a dull, dark dock," seems to have been
the chief business of the founder. Thus is he always represented
cross-legged and contemplative, with eyes downcast, "cleaving with
the thunderbolt of science the mountain of ignorance," and perceiving
the illusory nature of all things. So he comes at last to that state
in which he breaks the bonds binding him to existence and enters into
the complete Nirvana.

In this religion pity is pre-eminent, for it is sympathy with
suffering. But it does not confine itself to human beings. Animals
are also to share our sympathies, and here we meet with the
foundation of Wagner's idea in "Parsifal" of the sacredness of the
life of dumb creatures in the realms of the Holy Grail. But now let
us see how Wagner works out his jumble of religious and philosophic
doctrines.

Parsifal is a pure fool. Weigh that, first of all. He knows nothing;
yet when he enters the flower-garden he compliments the women on
their beauty, and fails to understand what they want of him. O wise
young judge! this pure fool, who does not know what is the matter
with Amfortas, and therefore has no desire to aid him, must be
enlightened by pity. So Wagner sets Kundry to work to tell him the
story of his mother's sufferings, and she ends the narration by
printing a long kiss upon his lips. Wagner was fond of long kisses
set to music, and he used one in "Siegfried" as an awakener.

Now what happens? This salacious kiss of an unchaste woman, imprinted
on the lips of a youth who was, according to Wagner's delineation
of him, as innocent as a child of eight or ten, instantly opens
up to him the entire experience of Amfortas, and fills him with
pity and horror! That is, indeed, a miracle. And to make the
thing psychologically more absurd, Wagner shows us this "pure
fool" battling madly with the simultaneous working of these two
emotions. What has become of the enlightenment by pity? Plainly
the enlightenment comes first and the pity afterward! Furthermore,
Parsifal prays to the Redeemer for forgiveness for his failure to
understand the scene in the hall of the Grail. But, as H. E. Krehbiel
pertinently asked in an article in the "New York Tribune," what could
the boy have done when he had not yet got the sacred spear from
Klingsor?

What a hold, then, the Buddhistic ideas, toward which Wagner was
led by Schopenhauer, had taken upon him! The religion of the crucial
scene of the drama is not Christian at all. The outward and visible
signs of the scene are purely pagan, but the underlying philosophy
is Buddhistic. It is the final issue of the dreams which this master
visionary had in his mind when he planned "The Victors." The only
remnant of Christian story in this act is the reminiscence of the
drama which Wagner once planned relating to the Saviour.

In his "Jesus of Nazareth" he intended to show Mary of Magdala in
love with the Divine One. Wagner was no fool. Nor was he a madman, as
Nordau has tried to show. But he was first, last, and all the time a
theatrical thinker. His imagination dwelt in the show-house, and all
was grist that came to his mill. If he had thought the meditations of
the Creator good material for a music drama, he would have laid his
artistic hands upon the eternal throne itself.

Thus, he shrank not from grafting spectacular show, Schopenhauerian
ethics, and Buddhistic dogmas on the legend of the Holy Grail. As
a matter of absolute fact, the Christian elements in this drama
are almost wholly spectacular and in the nature of accessories. If
ministers of the Gospel desire to be shocked by "Parsifal,"--and
they have reason to be, if they look for it in the right place,--let
them consider the place which the Holy Grail and the ceremony of the
communion occupy in this play.

They are merely stage devices to heighten the picture of the
suffering of Amfortas, and to impress upon our minds the vital need
of the enlightenment of the pure fool. The processional of the Grail
is spectacle pure and simple. The eating of the Last Supper is
spectacle pure and simple. It has absolutely nothing to do with the
story of the drama.

The unveiling of the Grail is necessary because it shows how Amfortas
is made to suffer agony. But it is no assistance to such Christian
ethics as there are in this muddle. If Amfortas has an incurable
wound, which is merely the outward symbol of conscience, he ought not
to need the sight of the Grail to make him feel worse. The thought of
his unworthiness to be a member of the chaste brotherhood should be
enough.

The foot-washing incident is theatricalism of the crassest kind. Can
any one show that it has a direct connection with the development
of the story? The argument in its favor is that it shows Kundry
as a penitent, and establishes her in relations of atonement with
Parsifal. Quite unnecessary, for the significance of the second act
is that Parsifal, having resisted her tempting, is spiritually her
master and also her redeemer. The act of absolution is made possible
by his triumph over the flesh. He could have baptized her and bidden
her trust in the Lord without offering us a portrait of the Saviour
as represented in the seventh chapter of St. Luke:--

    "And behold, a woman in the city, which was a sinner, when
    she knew that Jesus sat at meat in the Pharisee's house,
    brought an alabaster box of ointment,

    "And stood at his feet behind him weeping, and began to
    wash his feet with tears, and did wipe them with the hairs
    of her head, and kissed his feet and anointed them with the
    ointment."

Wagner brings on the tears after the foot-washing, so that he can
show us how Kundry was released from the curse of laughter. Or was
the curse imposed solely that this theatrical picture might be
introduced?

The sacred spear has some connection with the story, but the weapon
is not an important feature of Christianity. There is even room for
doubt as to whether there ever was a sacred spear at all. The wound
certainly existed; but who can vouch for the preservation of the
spear as an object of reverence? So let us for the present dismiss
the profound religious basis of Richard Wagner's "Parsifal." Buddha
and Arthur Schopenhauer taught the dramatist more essentials than the
Holy Bible did. The foundations of the drama rest on the philosophy
of negation. The Christianity is merely ornamental, spectacular, and
delusive.




                 III.--THE NATIONAL RELIGIOUS DRAMA

    I shall lay down a type of theological orthodoxy to which all
    the divine legends in our city must conform.

                             PLATO, _Republic_ (_Grote's abstract_).


"Parsifal" is the supreme test of the outcome of Wagner's theory
that the modern theatre ought to bear the same relation to the life
of the people as the theatre of the Greeks did. All students of the
master's writings know that he preached this especially in those
years when his system had attained definite and detailed form in
his mind. In the Greek theatre he saw an art influence far-reaching
and mighty,--an influence which dominated because it dramatized the
artistic and religious ideals of a people. That he failed to discern
the identity of religion and art in the symbolical embodiments named
gods by the imaginative Greeks is another story.

Furthermore, he objected strenuously and rightly to any criticism of
his philosophic and artistic system based on the study of his early
works, which were written before his system was fully developed. In
the "Communication to My Friends" he says:--

    "Certain critics who pretend to judge my art doings as a
    connected whole have set about their task with this same
    uncritical heedlessness and lack of feeling. Views on the
    nature of art that I have proclaimed from a standpoint which
    it took me years of evolution step by step to gain, they
    seize on for the standard of their verdict, and point them
    back upon those very compositions from which I started on the
    natural path of evolution that led me to this standpoint.

    "When for instance--not from the standpoint of abstract
    æsthetics, but from that of practical artistic experience--I
    denote the _Christian principle as hostile to or incapable of
    art_, these critics point me out the contradiction in which
    I stand toward my earlier dramatic works, which undoubtedly
    are filled with a certain tincture of this principle so
    inextricably blended with our modern evolution."

Excellent. The italics are not Wagner's. Let us, then, avoid falling
into the error of chaining Wagner to the beautiful Christianity
idealized by dramatic art, which he, unwise youth that he was, poured
into his "Tannhäuser," and confine ourselves to the full-fledged
"Parsifal," in which we are not, as he tells us, to regard the
Christianity as a vital art principle, but as one opposed to true
art. What does the man mean?

One thing is clear. Wagner did endeavor to theatricalize religions
and to parody in his feeble modern manner the theatre of the Greeks.
But if he failed (and who can doubt that he did after studying the
bloodless philosophy of the last product of his genius?), it was
because he was trying to do with calculating forethought what the
Greek did spontaneously, and because his religion supplied him
plentifully and unconsciously with the Schopenhauerian materials of
art; namely, Eternal Ideas represented by means of prototypes.

How came Wagner to fail in his puerile attempt to make a drama
out of a supposed incident in the life of Christ? Misled by the
similarity of his conception of the Saviour of mankind as a pure
human being resisting the seductions of a temptress in the person
of Mary Magdalen to his Tannhäuser battling with carnal passion
typified by Venus, or his Parsifal, remaining innocent through sheer
guilelessness, he set out to thrust into the glare of the footlights
the personality of Jesus. And then he found that the personality
was not merely human, nor the poetic embodiment of an idea, even an
Eternal Idea, but an everlasting miracle and mystery, a divinity
beyond the reach of his trap-doors, purple lights, and tenor tubas.

The story of Christ is tremendously dramatic, but it has eluded
every attempt at theatrical treatment. The thing done at Oberammergau
is not drama, but an old-fashioned mystery play. It is a moving
panorama. Pinero, Belasco, or even Ibsen would shrink from an attempt
to dramatize for the ordinary theatre the story of the Saviour. But
Wagner, blinded by his own ambition to make a show of all things,
to seize upon every suggestion of religion as material for music,
thought for a time that he could turn the Son of Man into a mime.

What a different art work was that of the Greek dramatist! How much
more direct and thornless was the path by which he reached the
theatrical representation of his gods and goddesses and the dramatic
relation of the fables in which they were the actors! With his stylus
in hand he sat at gaze upon a world of personated ideas, of symbols
in action. All was poetic and imaginative. All was the creation of
the human mind speculating upon the operation of unseen forces and
subtle passions. There was no almighty revelation to baffle him. The
infinite did not come and stand before him in an incomprehensible
mortalization of itself. What he had of the world beyond the skies
was the dreaming of his own kind.

What were Zeus and Hermes, Aphrodite and Hera, Artemis and Apollo,
Pallas and Poseidon, but personifications of ideas, those eternal
types which even the nugatory speculation of Schopenhauer postulated
as the materials of true art? When the Greek tragic dramatist was
not utilizing the gods, he employed the people of the mythologic
tales. When Phrynicus, in 511 B. C., wrote a tragedy on the capture
of Miletus, melting an audience to tears with the pathos of a
well-known contemporary event, he was fined a thousand drachmæ for
his ill-chosen subject.

When Wagner delved in the pagan mythology of the Northmen, he fell
upon metal like that of the Greeks. Nearly every personage in the
burg of Wallhal has a companion on Olympus. In the Eddas Wagner found
eternal types created by the human imagination by the same processes
as those of the Greeks. Hence the splendid humanity of his Wotan, his
Brünnhilde, his Fricka.

What had the Greek? The entire Grecian religion grew out of the
worship of the powers of nature. It recognized one power as the head
of all, Zeus, the god of heaven and light. "And God said, Let there
be light, and there was light." The Greek's notion of the beginning
of all things was the same as the Hebrew's. With Zeus abode in the
clear expanse of ether Hera, representing the eternal feminine
element in the divinity. The other gods were partly representatives
of the attributes of Zeus himself,--as Athene, knowledge, sprung
from his head; Apollo, beauty and purity; Hermes, who brings up the
treasures of fruitfulness from the depths of the earth; and Cora, the
child, now lost and now recovered by Hera, typifying the winter and
the summer. Poseidon and Hephæstus represented the elements, water
and fire. But why go farther with this catalogue? It is known to
every school-boy.

Together with these symbols the Greek dramatist had Hercules and
Prometheus, Paris and Orestes, Jason and Medea, and other earth-born
mythologic personages, the Siegfrieds and Gunthers and Sieglindes of
their mythologic world, demigods and heroes all, acting in fables of
wondrous poetic power, built on imaginative developments of ideals.
The Greek world knew these tales. The dramatist of the Æschylean
age was situated as Weber was when he put "Der Freischütz" before
Germany. He utilized the fairy tales of the people, and offering them
in a novel form made them eloquent with a new glory.

Æschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides were the masters of the Greek
tragedy; and their plays all deal with either mythologic or
legendary stories and personages. The ideas preached in the ethics
of their dramas were those of Greek morality. The gods and goddesses
introduced or referred to were the embodiments of Greek ideals.
Though the populace was not so able a doctrinaire as to know that
there was in truth but one deity, Zeus, of whom all the others were
but aids and expressions, it had the enormous advantage of intimate
acquaintance with the poetic attributes of the galaxy of gods. It was
a public ripe for its religious drama.

Now, when Richard Wagner set out to build up a modern theatre which
should have the same relation to the life of the people as the
theatre of the Greeks had to theirs, he started on the right path.
He took the legendary materials to be found in German literature. He
wrote with unerring judgment when he created his operatic version
of "The Flying Dutchman." The pity of it is that he did not compose
this work when he was at the period of the maturity of his genius.
We should have had something almost as splendid as "Tristan und
Isolde," for while the story is not so suggestive as the old legend
treated by Gottfried von Strassbourg, it is not far behind it. At any
rate, it is purely Teutonic in its character, though in its origin
it is Greek. For, of course, Vanderdecken is but a modern replica of
Ulysses. The Germans knew the story, for Heine had made it theirs.
Wagner wrote wisely and well in this drama.

In "Tannhäuser" again he found his materials in the vast
treasure-house of German literature and legend. Possibly this story
was known to fewer Germans than "The Flying Dutchman," but its
character was sympathetic to them and there was no mistaking the
force of its moral lesson. Yet the religious doctrines of this drama
are not essentially those of the Christian Church; they are those
of religion and morality in general. The idea of salvation through
love of a pure woman is the Goethean doctrine of the eternal womanly
leading us upward. It was not original with Wagner, but it was
beloved by him.

In "Lohengrin" we come nearer to the mystical thoughts of such a work
as "Parsifal," yet here humanity operates in the natural desire of
Elsa to reach into the secrets of her husband's heart and life, and
still more powerfully in the vengeful character of the sexless and
inexorable Ortrud.

In both of these splendid dramas of Wagner's genius we are
confronted at every step with the normal working of human passions,
and love throbs through both of them. In "Parsifal" we have no single
pulse of love. In "Parsifal" salvation is brought by ignorance and
miracle. In "Tannhäuser" it comes triumphantly through suffering,
repentance, and prayer. In "Parsifal" the sufferings of Amfortas are
relieved by the purity of another man. In "Tannhäuser" the misery
of the hero is assuaged by his own repentance and the holy love of
Elizabeth. The religion of "Tannhäuser" is human; that of "Parsifal"
is ceremonial, panoramic, abstract.

"Parsifal" is a dramatization of ceremonials. In the first and
third acts we behold the pageant of religious rites; in the second
the diorama of bacchanalian orgies. Externals are thrust upon us
constantly; the depths are hidden under a veil of scenic pretence
and musical delusion. The bulk of the music of the work is external
and descriptive. Little, indeed, is there of the tonal embodiment of
subjective ideas. Compare the three acts of "Parsifal" with the three
great emotional episodes of "Tristan und Isolde." What a stupendous
development the latter work shows of the tragedy of fatal passion!

In its first act the operation of a magical agency breaks down the
hitherto safe bonds of restraint and plunges two typical human beings
into the very vortex of flaming love. In the second act they rush
together and forget honor. The stroke of retribution falls; fate
deals her deadly blow. In the third act remorse, agony, death, and
the salvation of suffering souls by negation.

There is a drama which preaches no religious doctrine, which has no
dogma save the Buddhistic one of release from suffering by death, yet
which stands in closer relation to the life of the people than all of
Wagner's religious dramas, because it deals with world-thoughts.

When Wagner worked with the purely mythical and legendary tales of
the German people, he built dramas of national character and power.
When he undertook to turn into theatrical pageants the teachings of
Christianity, he failed utterly. The Greek succeeded because his
religion was one of symbols, of deifications of the powers of nature,
with its literature developed from tales of the fabulous doings of
gods and goddesses, tales embodying in imaginative form fundamental
facts of nature.

When Wagner sought his inspiration in the mythology of the North,
which was developed in precisely the same manner as the Greek
mythology, he found material of poetic and suggestive kind. But when,
by dramatizing Christian doctrine and history, he tried to bring
his national theatre into such relation to the life of the people
as the Greek dramatists brought theirs, he failed, for the simple
reason that at this point his entire theory as to the suitability of
mythical and legendary material to the use of the dramatist broke
down.

There is nothing mythological in the teachings of the Christian
religion, nor in the acts of its Founder or apostles. These
things stand apart from mythology and are differentiated from it
absolutely. They are not and could not have been the product of
human imagination, symbolizing human experience and speculation.
The profoundest philosophers of antiquity never hit upon the basic
doctrines of Christianity.

Beautiful as the teachings of Socrates are, they are essentially
human. The Sermon on the Mount sets up a system of ethics never
dreamed of by Aristotle or Plato. Only Buddha ever approached
Christ, and the outcome of the Hindu's entire system was not eternal
salvation and glory, but endless silence and the negation of death.
From this Wagner could not escape, even in his "Parsifal," for
Kundry, in the final scene, dies of what? Of a Buddhistic ethical
idea!

Wagner's greatest works are unquestionably those in which the
fundamental myths or legends were symbolical of human passions, of
the worldwide experience of mankind. "Tannhäuser," "Die Walküre,"
"Siegfried," "Götterdämmerung," and "Tristan und Isolde" are Wagner's
masterpieces of serious drama, not the saccharine "Lohengrin," nor
the tinselled ritual, "Parsifal." Are not those, with the matchless
comedy of manners, "Die Meistersinger," enough for one mind to have
created? Why should we believe it incumbent upon us to uphold all
that Wagner did?

We can say of him as Prentice said of Napoleon, "Grand, gloomy, and
peculiar, he sat a sceptred hermit, wrapped in the solitude of his
own originality." Taking him by and large, as the sailors say, he
was the most striking figure in musical history. Why discredit him
by trying to show that "Parsifal," the feeble child of his artistic
senility, was filled with the vigor of his young Volsung or the
radiant power of his immortal song of love insatiate?




                       DER RING DES NIBELUNGEN




                 I.--A FUTILE GOD AND A POTENT DEVIL

                                                The will
                  And high permission of all-ruling Heaven
                  Left him at large to his own dark designs.

                                    MILTON, _Paradise Lost_, Bk. I.


With every year the festival of the four dramas is celebrated in the
metropolis of the New World. Parsifalian orgies are new, and the wine
of the holy cup offers a novel intoxication to restless spirits ever
seeking fresh excitements. But your good, honest, old Wagnerite goes
yearly to gape in awestruck silence at the majesty of the "wildered"
Wotan, and to bask in the sunshine of Siegfried's radiant youth.
Whistle your Last Supper motive, you Monsalvationer, if you will, as
you crunch your lobster salad after the celebration, but we old-time
Wagnerites, who have hunted with the pack since first the "flight"
theme pulsated across the world, we shall trot home murmuring the
slumber motive and lay us down to pleasant dreams with a final sigh
of Fafner's "Lass't mich schlafen."

Perhaps this is a good time to review our impressions of that
wonderful creation of a strange genius, "Der Ring des Nibelungen."
Whatever else may be said of Wagner, it must always be admitted that
he was a genius. Something of the vanity of the child, the naïveté
that always dwells in the organization of the truly original artist,
is to be discerned in his every action, in his every utterance; and
it would be strange if it did not force itself upon our notice in his
works. There it discloses itself most frequently in a ludicrous error
of taking seriously things that can never be other than amusing to
the casual observer, and of missing the point of some of his own best
ideas.

Wagner has been much praised as a poet. Time was when the present
writer (who must be his own confessor), feeling the power and
beauty of the fundamental stuff in the music dramas, rather than
the adapter's cumbersome and rudely articulated Germanizing of it,
dreamed that Wagner had poetic craftsmanship of no mean order. But
he never fell into the error of regarding him as a brother of the
northern skalds, a bard chanting in full-blooded imagination. Wagner
was a dramatist, of an uncommonly high order, if you will, looking
always to the symbolism of musical investure for his stage pictures,
but just a dramatist and nothing more.

His truest drama, as it is his most finely wrought, is "Tristan und
Isolde," which rests upon the simplest of emotional propositions,
demonstrated in the most convincing of musical illustration. But
"Der Ring des Nibelungen" is his most ponderous conception, his
most elaborate structure, and withal second only to "Tristan und
Isolde" in the majestic heights of musical delineation to which it
triumphantly ascends.

Not a little of its musical glory grows out of its dramatic
difficulties. In its beginning it deals with gods, dwarfs, nixies
of the Rhine, and cumbersome giants, all fabulous, nebulous, in
some instances almost intangible figures, whose only force lies in
their simulation of humanity, and whose mastering weakness consists
in their unreality. Gradually these gods and goddesses fade away
and leave the picture occupied with purely human figures alone. The
last majestic burst of supernal majesty is the final scene of "Die
Walküre." In "Siegfried" a worn and weary wanderer, cherishing a
feeble hope, powerless to turn the flow of events, passes across the
canvas and dwindles out of sight before the dawn of human love.

The rest is pure humanity, except when in the end of
"Götterdämmerung" the imperial godhood of Brünnhilde enthrones itself
upon the wreck of worlds, and sings the death-warrant of the waning
Wotan and his wavering brood.

The futile and disappearing gods! These are the weird and enchanting
unrealities of Wagner's "Nibelungen" scheme. How they potter and
fumble with the machinery of the inevitable! How they falter and
fail in the presence of inscrutable Truth, which overcomes them like
a summer cloud! They parade before us in "Das Rheingold," clad in a
clarion of trumpets and trombones, made glorious with the radiance
of Wagner's blazing sunlight of sonorous chords; but they are none
the less futile. Save one,--Loge, the tempter, Loge, the spirit of
indomitable evil, who sows the seed of destruction in the beginning
and writes the plot of "Götterdämmerung" with a twist of his finger
toward the gleaming gold.

Of all Wagner's philosophic compositions, his psychological
conjurations out of the shadowy depths of his own fancy and the
equally cloudy shallows of Schopenhauer and Feuerbach, Loge is the
most intimately conceived and the most finely wrought. Disappearing,
indeed, he is, but by no means futile. The Mephistopheles of the
rock-ribbed north, the Lucifer of the hills, he unites all the
subtlety of the metropolitan conception of the sophisticated
Goethe with the breadth and spontaneity of the harp-strokes of the
storm-bred bard.

Wagner does not paint Loge so brilliantly in text as he does in
music. This Satanic tempter of the wise ones is an operatic character
raised to the seventh power. His words are unconvincing without his
music, which charges them and him with a boundless significance.
Never once in all his flickering career does he utter a single
sentence of such elemental majesty as that of Boito's Mefistofele:
"Son lo spirito che nega." That looming figure of the archlibrettist
of Tuscany spreads the shadow of contemporaneous sophistication
across the operatic firmament. Standing with his defiant gaze upon
the throne of the many-voiced invisible, he is a lyric reincarnation
of the epic Lucifer of Milton.

Loge is no such mighty spirit. He comes upon the scene whining
excuses for an ill-done errand. He slips, he slides, he wriggles
away. He is the aurora of casuistry, the embodiment of the elusive.
The flickering fire is his outward manifestation. He is mean. He is
a sneak. But he is the intellectual superior of the entire coterie
of futile gods, and he laughs at their infantile incapacity. Poor
old Wotan! He mumbles in his beard that he cannot do mental tricks
as Loge can. A simple-minded old god is he, who would gladly cheat
the lumbering giants out of their guerdon, but does not know how. So
he turns to Loge, who comes waving and caracoling upon the scene--to
what theme? That of the fire! A theme which is as elusive as his
nature, a theme which has neither beginning nor end, which wanders
along in the form of an indefinite decimal of harmony and never for
an instant establishes a definite tonality.

Every movement of Loge, every betrayal of a new thought formed in his
shifty mind, is accompanied by an utterance of this motive in the
orchestra. Not once in "Das Rheingold" does the theme rest itself
upon the firm foundations of a major triad. Chromatic in form, it
is chromatic, chameleon-like in color. It is the real Loge. It is a
musical triumph, because in terms of purely descriptive imitation it
expresses a psychologic study. The music is the shifting, flickering,
changeful, destroying fire; the fire is the soul of Loge and the
first fruit of perdition.

The theme returns in the last scene of "Die Walküre," when Wotan,
the helpless father, has put his best-beloved to sleep. He is to
surround her with a belt of guardian fire. Fire is the soul of
Loge, a lovely protector for unconscious virtue! Again we hear
the fire music, but only for fire. Loge, most subtle of the gods
of the field, has to all appearances been the most futile. He has
disappeared already. But now his fire, at any rate, returns and beams
beneficently from a base of diatonic major harmonies with tinkling of
blissful bells. Did Wagner realize the fathomless depths of his own
sarcasm here? Or is it all a beautiful chance?

In the last scene of "Siegfried" there is an echo of the Loge
theme, but it means almost nothing. The same echo is heard in
"Götterdämmerung," Act I. In Act III. of the same drama, when
Brünnhilde seizes the torch to fire the funeral pyre whose flames
shall set all Walhalla in a blaze, the Loge chromatics, together
with a gleam of the ring theme, flashes up, but it is as futile as
the almost-forgotten Loge. Here was Wagner's opportunity to tell the
truth about his own secret conception of this vast phantasmagoria of
fact and fable. At the very end of "Das Rheingold" the crafty one
says:

      "A feverish fancy
      Doth woo me to wander
  Forth in flickering fire:
      To burn and waste them
      Who bound me erewhile.
      Rather than be
  Thus blindly engulfed,
  Even were they of gods the most godlike."

No Walhalla for the free spirit of flame, but liberty and the
ultimate destruction of these pitiful children of the light. Wagner
might have let the glittering chromatics of the fire theme rise just
once into a peal of majestic power in the end of "Götterdämmerung,"
when Wotan and all his hosts sat helpless amid the blazing of
Walhalla. It is Loge's triumph, is it not? Oh, yes, of course, it is
the stupendous immolation of Brünnhilde, with the unutterable thought
behind it and the regeneration of the earth before it. But Loge would
have seen in it nothing but the victory of the eternal principle of
destruction, which Wagner epitomized even better than he knew in his
musical characterization of the fire-fiend.

What was really in Wagner's mind when he wrote that extraordinarily
beautiful passage of song for Loge in the first scene of "Das
Rheingold"?

  "Where life ebbeth and floweth
  In flood and earth and air,
      All asked I,
      Ever inquiring,
  Where sinew doth reign,
      And seedlings are rooted,
      What well a man
      Could mightier deem
  Than woman's wonderful worth."

Again, it is not the text, but the marvellous burst of throbbing
melody that tells the thought in Wagner's mind. But does it tell all?
Study well the phrases in the score. Are they sincere, or does Wagner
shadow forth just a suspicion of the dishonesty which lurks in the
utterance? Loge knows that he has yet his trump card, the gold of the
Rhine, to play; and either he believes that will be a winning card,
or he is not the devil, after all.

What, then, becomes of this manifestation of Wagnerian philosophy,
this joyous tempter of wooden gods? At the end of "Das Rheingold"
his personal career ends. Henceforth only his soul hovers about us.
Like the genie who, according to the veracious chronicler of the
"Arabian Nights," had sinned against Solomon, he was shut up in a
box, the old earth itself. He fades out of sight to reappear only in
a materialistic exhibit of steam and red fire. A sad end, indeed, for
such a thoughtful representation of sophistry. "Two special powers,"
says M. Taine, "lead mankind,--impulse and idea." Loge was the
embodiment of idea. Farewell to thee, Idea. Henceforth let impulse
lead us onward to love and death. Yet shall not Idea, subtle, crafty,
remorseless, triumph at last?

The foil to Loge is Wotan, foil and victim. What a sorrowful
spectacle is this unfortunate master of the gods, who takes up Loge
because that craftsman has brains, and yet cannot withstand the
temptations of his own devil! Jupiter did not need a devil to lead
him astray. A neatly turned ankle or a pair of melting eyes sufficed
to lure Zeus from Olympus. The world and the flesh were equal to
his undoing. But here is a primitive god, manufactured out of the
imagination of a wholly unsophisticated people, far removed from the
polish and culture of the Greeks, and he cannot sin in hot blood.
First of all, he must be tempted by a fiend, who lures him with the
promise of unlimited power. Zeus had his power ready-made.

Wotan was right. What was a god to do who was short of power?
Preposterous! He could not afford to allow some one else to get the
gold and make the ring. Alberich already had it. What was to be
done? Get it away from him, and so save the Walhalla dynasty from
being dethroned. Wise Wotan! It never occurred to him that Loge was
planning just that _coup_.

Here is a chief god whose power rests upon contracts, yet who does
not know how to make an advantageous bargain with two stupid giants!
Pity the sorrows of the one-eyed god! He is not omnipotent. He is
surrounded by enemies, and afar off looms the fathomless abyss of the
dusk of the gods, the pall of Ragnarok, the last battle. A fortress
must he have, and heroes culled by the aerial Valkyrs from the slain
of all the world to fight for Walhalla in the final hour.

Self-preservation is the selfish motive of Wotan's sin. He haggles
with Fafner and Fasolt for a haven of refuge, and offers a price he
knows he dare not pay. Without Freia, the goddess of youth, he must
wither. What does all this mean? Simply that Wotan was the subject
of a moral law outside of and above him. Was it strange that the
primitive mind could not conceive a god who was himself the law?

Not at all; for, after all, these children of the ages made deities
of human attributes,--power, knowledge, passion, beauty, swiftness.
They knew all these attributes were subject to the moral law, for the
blackest years of Egypt had not obscured the truth that the wages of
sin is death. In "Das Rheingold" Wotan falls a prey to the moral law
as interpreted to him by the giants. In "Die Walküre" he again makes
a foolish effort to dodge it, and the outraged majesty of Fricka
demands revenge. What a futile god!

The figure of Wotan is heroic only in "Die Walküre." Here we find
the old god at bay. In "Rheingold" he is a feeble plotter; in
"Walküre" he faces the inevitable and fights in the last ditch. In
"Siegfried" he has become a garrulous dotard, maundering about the
earth, impotent and puerile, quibbling in childish conundrums with a
shifty dwarf, pledging a head he would not sacrifice, waiting for the
defiant act of the youthful hero, and enacting the silly mummery of
opposing him with the spear which he knows the boy despises.

"In vain! I cannot hinder thee!" he tragically exclaims, as he
stalks off the stage and into the gallery of properties which Wagner
reserves for destruction in the last scene of all. And this is the
All-Father, the Thunderer of the Norse mythology, the supine creature
of moral laws which his pitiable nature cannot grasp and which he
feebly strives throughout the whole story to escape.

What music has Wagner evolved to body forth the traits and
accessories of this godless deity? The Walhall theme, which
identifies with the god the stone walls of his stronghold; the
spear motive, which speaks in splendid accents of the firmness of
sacred obligations, broken by Wotan in the very first scene of the
tragedy; Wotan's anger; Wotan's distress; Wotan the wanderer; Wotan's
bequest of the inheritance of the world. All these themes depict this
entangled god in the meshes of circumstance. There is not a single
motive setting forth any inherent grandeur of character, any great or
noble thought or passion blazing from his soul.

Walhall was Wotan's chapel of refuge. The spear's holy runes were
outside of his personality and greater than it. His anger was
awakened by the disobedience of a loving daughter who sought to be
what she had always been, the heart's wish of the god. The distress
was the fruit of a realization that the stern grip of the moral law
was strangling the whole coterie of Walhall because of its master's
sins.

Wotan the wanderer,--what a desolate succession of changing
tonalities, telling of a god without a local habitation or a name,
a god whose occupation was literally gone! The bequest theme tells
of this doddering deity's resignation of power in favor of youth
and love, two honest agencies much better fitted to carry on the
administration of a world than trickery and subterfuge.

Carlyle in his "French Revolution" harps upon the end that was
contained in the beginning. "Cast forth thy act, thy word," again in
his "Sartor Resartus" he says, "into the ever working universe; it
is a seed grain that cannot die; unnoticed to-day (says one) it will
be found flourishing as a banyan grove (perhaps also as a hemlock
forest) after a thousand years." The Scripture has tersely summarized
the whole matter in the prophetic declaration that the wages of sin
is death.

Wotan's original sin in cheating the giants spreads itself into the
hemlock forest of a mighty tragedy, but for the god himself the
Biblical maxim stands in letters of fire. And here mark the awful
majesty of the Norse myth. Wotan and all his brood fall victims in
the end to the physical manifestation of the evil spirit, Loge.

They are burned in Walhalla. The flickering fire singes out the last
vestiges of this rotten dynasty. The spirit of temptation wreaks
its own vengeance upon the tempted. "Son lo spirito che nega." The
Mephistophelian principle of negation wipes the futile gods off
the firmament. Was there any touch of Schopenhauer or Buddha in
this? Not a whiff. It was pure, stern, primeval morality. It was
unsophisticated man's recognition of the inexorable justice of the
moral law.

How infinitely grander this conception is than the flimsy and
artificial doctrines of the seduction and spear cure in "Parsifal"!
In the consecrational festival play all is manufactured, all is
artificial. The entire external machinery of the thing is a cheap
theatrical pose. In "Der Ring des Nibelungen" the ethics are the
common sense of a people, nay, of whole races, sprung from the mystic
Aryan source and filtered through the anxious thought of a hundred
tribes that speculated under the inspiring stars across the valleys
and plains of all Europe.

How much of all this did Wagner perceive when he was constructing his
extraordinary drama in four plays? His scheme, according to his own
words, contemplated the representation of the gods as writhing in
helplessness under the burden imposed by their own transgression of
the law. This burden could be removed only by the action of a free
agent, a man, whose deeds were all his own. After Titanic preparation
Wagner places this man before us in the person of Siegfried.

His death is the vicarious sacrifice for the gods. In order to get
him killed Wagner writes a whole drama, a mighty one indeed, in which
this noble hero is made to commit a crime while under the influence
of enchantment. He is slain for that crime by Hagen, who knows that
he is innocent, and who contrived the whole plot simply to have an
excuse for killing him, in order to get back the Nibelungs' ring.

What evidence is there that Wagner perceived the full significance of
the final triumph of Loge over the erring Wotan? Not one jot. That
the idea occurred to him in its purely external and physical form is
proved by a passage in the final speech of Brünnhilde:

        "Fly home, ye ravens!
        Rede it in Walhalla
  What here on the Rhine ye have heard!
        To Brünnhilde's rock
        Go round about.
        Yet Loge burns there:
  Walhall bid him revisit!
        Draweth near in gloom
        The dusk of the gods.
  Thus, casting my torch,
  I kindle Walhalla's towers."

And that is all. Yet the thought lurks always beneath the surface
of the tragedy. Wotan, the father and master of the futile and
disappearing gods, fell a victim to evil itself, to evil which in the
consuming power of flickering fire was its own executioner.




                   II.--THE WOMAN AND THE SERPENT

                 I will put enmity between thee and the serpent.

                                                 GENESIS  iii. 15


Wagner's gallery of portraits of women has been much praised. Senta,
mooning by her idle spinning-wheel and waiting the time when she
might cast her pure spirit on the stained bosom of the ocean rover
and so save him another seven years' damnation; Elsa, wavering
between faith and doubt and finally rushing to destruction out of
sheer curiosity; the holy Elizabeth, praying for the life of him
who had committed against her the deadliest of all sins, gross
infidelity, the sanctified Elizabeth, sweetest, purest, most adorable
of all Wagner's heroines; the blazing torch of human passion, Isolde,
the primeval, unconventional woman; and Brünnhilde, the wish maid,
the sleeping beauty, the waking avenger and liberator,--all these
have been praised by learned commentators in divers tongues.

Wagner was a student of women. He married two, and there are also
many unpublished letters. He wrote "Tristan und Isolde" on the shores
of Lucerne, where Isolde's real name was Mathilde. In the end he was
dominated by a woman, but it may be doubted whether he ever really
comprehended the "ewig weibliche," of which he made such clever
theatrical use. There is not a very convincing feminine element in
"Das Rheingold." The first disclosure is of three Rhein daughters
sporting in the gauzy depths of their native element and singing in
a language all their own around a nugget of gold of which strange
lies are told. It is said that any person who makes a ring of that
gold will have power and dominion over the world. The truth is that
whosoever possesses that ring is bound to get into trouble, because a
filthy little black dwarf will place a freak's curse upon it.

These three fish-tailed maidens, frisking in the sallow glare
of the shaded spot-light, youthful of aspect, ebullient of
manner, irreproachable in morals, so far as one can judge from
their treatment of the winsome Alberich, outlive the futile and
disappearing gods. They come to the surface in the final scene of
"Götterdämmerung," and wrest back their ring from the hands of Hagen,
whom they incontinently drown in their dotted Swiss habitation. There
must be a deep moral lesson somewhere in this. What is it? Possibly
it signifies that good girls are always triumphant in the end. At any
rate, it accentuates the pitiable feebleness of the mighty ones of
Walhall.

Another feminine figure in the foreword of the trilogy is the
excellent Erda. This portentous poser in green light and veiling
makes two appearances in the course of the tragedy. The first is in
"Rheingold" and the second in "Siegfried." She occupies a position
somewhat similar to that of a Greek chorus. She helps the audience to
a comprehension of what the rather incomprehensible gods are doing.
She always comes to the surface when Wotan is "stumped."

The first time she comes when he is about to commit an act of
folly. She tells him to get rid of the ring which he had employed
so much strategy to procure. He promptly obeys her, although he has
never seen her before, and was pretty thoroughly astonished by her
unexpected appearance. The second time she discloses herself when
Wotan is sorely in need of more sound advice. We now learn that
Wotan, who in "Rheingold" had declared that he intended to know
more of the lady, has not wasted his time in idle prating. The nine
Valkyrs are the living proofs of this. Erda is plainly not at all
pleased to meet her old friend again. She gives him another dark and
dismal warning, and leaves him to chew the cud of his own cheerful
reflection.

Freia, the charming young woman for whom the giants wrangle, is a
mere figure in "Rheingold." She might as well be a piece of stage
property. She counts for nothing else. She has no more dramatic
significance than the lumps of gold which the dwarfs lug upon
their straining shoulders. She belongs to the same category as the
delectable Donner and Froh, who stand about in odd corners and try
desperately to look as if they were Vulcan and Apollo, whereas they
are neither.

One feminine character stands alone in "Rheingold." The virtuous
Fricka, type of that species of amiable wife who regards all mortal
desire as utterly depraved and who would joy to wrap herself in a
spotless mantle of _noli me tangere_ and let her husband worship her
on bended knees outside the portals of her holy temple,--she is the
woman with a mission in this splendid tragedy of futile gods and
fumbling mortals.

But Fricka is right, after all. If Wotan had listened to her
advice, he would have come out of all his difficulties much better.
The fount of misfortune, as far as Fricka is concerned, was her
failure to brush the dust off her own garments in the day of the
first temptation. Loge knew where to touch the quick of her woman's
weakness. "Will the gold make pretty ornaments for women?" she asked;
and Loge, who, being the spirit of evil, well knew the root, declared
that there was nothing which it could do better than that. And so
Fricka stood actionless while Wotan went down to Niebelheim to rape
the gold from Alberich.

Short-sighted Fricka! Mean-spirited Fricka! True woman Fricka!
When she has tacitly consented to the theft of the gold, what does
she? Seeing her poor old one-eyed husband struggling to escape the
consequences of his guilt by creating a race of free agents to make
the atonement for him, she pounces upon him with a stern demand that
Siegmund shall die for violating her standards of virtue. But who
ever expected to find a consistent logic in the mind of fair woman,
even a resident of high Olympus?

Having turned upon the hand that sought to benefit her, what does
she? She joins the procession of the futile and disappearing gods.
Fricka mounts her ram-hauled chariot and slides away into the past,
only to reappear in the chaste and general conflagration of the last
great scene. She has served her purpose. She has made the drama of
"Siegfried" imperatively necessary.

Siegmund being slain in answer to her inexorable demand, Brünnhilde
must be punished for trying to carry out Wotan's original plot. Of
course that is well enough. If Brünnhilde had had her way, there
never would have been any drama of "Siegfried" and consequently
no "Götterdämmerung." But without Siegfried things cannot go on.
Sieglinde must hie her to the dark forest in the east, there to sob
out her sweet but shadowed young life, and leave to the whining Mime
the nursery task of rearing the youthful Volsung.

So much for the eternal feminine in the celestial circle of the
trilogy. Poor little Gutrune! She's worth the whole lot of them. She
at least was a gentle, soulful, loving woman, who was not troubling
her spirit with a desire for gold, but who was possessed of an
honest ambition to be the wife of the most important gentleman of
the district. Social position was not what she sought, for she had
that already. She was a Gibichung, which was the same in the Rhine
valley as being a Biddle in Philadelphia. No; what she yearned for
was distinction. She would have been a lady of the White House, if
possible, had she lived in our time. Anyhow, she was a woman with
whom one can sympathize, for she really liked Siegfried.

Last but not least of the "Rheingold" coterie are the giants. Fafner
is an admirable character. He knows just what he wishes and he goes
straight to the point. First of all, he wishes to possess himself of
Freia because she would serve two purposes; namely, to keep house
and cook for him and at the same time to preserve his youth. But the
lumbering Fasolt, that overgrown blond basso, must go and fall in
love with the simpering little soprano leggiere. How came Wagner not
to remember the law of operatic tradition?

It is only another instance of his lack of the sense of humor. Fafner
very properly disposes of Fasolt and goes off with the gold. And here
follows one of the genuinely poetic touches of the tragedy. This
scaly miser who has the hoard, the tarnhelm, and the ring, and who
simply snuggles them up in a cave without reaping a single benefit
from their possession, is put out of the drama by Siegfried, the
embodiment of careless youth, hot blood, and human passion. Possibly
Wagner thought of this, and possibly he did not; but at any rate we
may do so, and thus intensify our poetic mood.

What effect has the disappearance of the futile gods upon the
dramatic development of the story? Wotan is the hero of "Rheingold"
and "Walküre." These two sections of the drama are concerned with the
adventures of a god in search of a method of government. The hero of
"Siegfried" and "Götterdämmerung" is Siegfried, a mortal in search
of a _raison d'être_. The former plays bad politics and learns too
late that in statecraft as in business honesty is the best policy.
The latter follows the inspirations of youth and nature, and comes to
grief because he is the Parsifal of the north, a "guileless fool."

Musically "Rheingold" is a vorspiel. It introduces a few fundamental
themes, rings the harmonic changes on them, and makes way for the
real first movement, "Die Walküre." Of this work the music is the
salvation, for its second act is dramatically so feeble, so ill-made,
and so prosy that it would drive people out of the theatre were it
not for its melodic richness. Fricka's lecture of Wotan, one of
the vital scenes of the whole trilogy, is dramatically a bore; but
musically it is strong and interesting, and it approaches its end
with one of the most imposing phrases conceived by the wizard of
Bayreuth, the phrase with which Fricka intones the words:--

  "Deiner ew'gen Gattin
  Heilige Ehre
  Schirme heut' ihr Schild."

"The holy honor of thy eternal spouse as a shield this day protects
her." That is Wagner's one proclamation of the majesty of Fricka
and the chastity of the law which she represented. It is the finest
musical thought in the whole second act of "Die Walküre," for, after
all, the much-vaunted "Todesverkündigung" is a situation rather
than a theme. The brass melody of it is not genuinely imposing,
especially when the impersonator of Brünnhilde does not know how to
appear mysterious and foreboding. The fight in the clouds is one of
Wagner's impracticable conceptions. When it is perfectly executed, it
is unconvincing; when it is not, it is quite incomprehensible, and
sometimes it is even comic.

Musically "Die Walküre" consists of the first and last acts, and the
first really begins with the duet between Siegmund and Sieglinde. All
that goes before is preparation, interesting by reason of its musical
narrative, but much too prolix, as all Wagner's explanations are.
Siegmund's narrative is three times as long as is necessary to afford
a reason for the hatred of Hunding. It would have been more subtle
and more dramatic, anyhow, to let Hunding's thirst for vengeance
rest entirely upon his discovery of the interest of his wife and the
visitor for each other.

But let that pass. The duet of Siegmund and Sieglinde is generally
accepted as one of Wagner's great achievements in sustained melody.
The love-song is babbled now by musical babes. It is very pretty, and
it has a manly ring, which we may all admire. But the third act of
"Die Walküre" dwells from beginning to end in the sunlit regions of
genius.

The feebleness of Wotan here loses itself in a sea of infinite
pathos. The power of the magic hand of Wagner in the creation of
dramatic atmosphere is seen in the tumultuous storming of the Valkyrs
through the inky air. "How now, ye secret black and midnight hags;
what is't ye do?" The salutation of Macbeth to the witches pales
before the lightnings of the winged steeds. Into the midst of this
festival of the furies plunges the ill-assorted pair, Brünnhilde and
Sieglinde.

Thundering upon their traces comes Wotan, the irate god, whose
well-meant efforts to escape the complications wrought by his own
misdeeds have been thwarted by the erring wish maiden. Hearken to the
old scold berating his frightened daughters: "Out with ye, hussies.
Your sister has been disobedient. Speak to her, and I'll whip ye,
too."

Slinking away into the waning storm, they leave the father and
the foolishly loving daughter together. The mighty seething of the
musical sea subsides, leaving a deep underrunning swell of feeling.
The billowing rush of the Valkyr theme gives way to the plaintive
flow of the motive of Brünnhilde's pleading, one of the most
poignantly expressive melodies ever conceived by Wagner. How it wells
upward in the tender voices of the wood wind!

The stricken Valkyr grovels at the feet of the perplexed Wotan. What
will he do with her? The two engage in a long and unnecessary wordy
wrangle over the deed of the goddess. Wagner must talk, talk, talk.
He is a German dramatist. His music alone saves him from perdition.
Prate as he may of the organic union of the arts, the magic of melody
and harmony is his wand of transformation.

With that he lifts the tiresome rehearsal of the incidents of
"Rheingold" by Wotan to eloquence. With that he changes the
hair-splitting of Tristan and Isolde to the most passionate of love
duets. With that he makes almost a miracle of Siegfried's condensed
narrative in the last act of "Götterdämmerung." The theory is a
perfect one; Wagner's practice is wholly faulty. His music saves him.
He is sometimes no better than an old-fashioned opera librettist, and
writes long pages of bald text simply in order to clothe them with
musical glory.

Brünnhilde complains: "Why are you angry at me, father?" He answers,
"You know well enough what you've done." "You told me to do it,"
says she. "But afterward I told you not to do it," says he. "But you
really didn't mean that. You wished me to protect Siegmund," declares
Brünnhilde. "You made the other order because you were afraid of
Fricka." And then Brünnhilde takes forty lines to tell Wotan what she
did, which both he and we already know. Wotan takes just forty lines
more to tell Brünnhilde that while he has been struggling with his
problems she has had nothing to do but enjoy herself (how many mortal
fathers talk thus to their daughters)! and that now he has no further
use for her light soul.

Thus they bandy words till finally we come to Hecuba. Wotan tells
her that she is to be put to sleep and that the man who awakens
her shall have her. She begs for the protection of the magic fire,
and this far-seeing god stares amazed and enraptured at the birth
of a new idea. Glorious! He will commit this precious jewel of his
soul to the guardianship of his arch enemy, Loge, the fire spirit,
the treacherous, the shifty, the ultimate destroyer, not only of
Brünnhilde, but of Walhalla and its futile brood.

Oh, Wagner, how much more prescient were the skalds than thou! But
who thinks of all this while the performance is in progress? No one.
The triumphant music swells to the very bursting point of emotional
rhapsody. The entrance of the farewell of Wotan is one of the
sublimest conceptions of the master craftsman in tone.

But there is a moment, a great, overmastering, torrential moment, in
this scene, which is equalled only once or twice elsewhere in the
trilogy. It is the moment when Brünnhilde and Wotan stand and gaze
one upon the other, like the transformed Tristan and Isolde, and
the plaintive, pitiful motive of the Valkyr's pleading rises into
a tremendous, pealing burst of passionate yearning, which sets the
whole orchestra reeling and rocking with the poignancy of its melody
and wrings the tears from the eyes of the listener.

That is the climax of "Die Walküre." It is the victory of the
child's love over the futile and disappearing All-Father. It is the
last utterance of the majesty of Walhalla. Thenceforward godhood
disappears not only from Brünnhilde, but from all Walhalla. The human
hero is now to come, to see, and to command.

And as the curtain slowly shuts the pathetic figures from our sight,
Loge--flickering, fluttering Loge--satisfied for once that he is
master of the situation, sings out the comedy in the major mode. The
spiritual tonality of Loge for once is fixed and inexorable. The
sleep of Brünnhilde is the prologue to her immolation, and the fire
at her bedside is the precursor of the fire of her funeral pyre which
shall engulf the futile gods. "Rest, perturbed spirit." Rest in the
victorious publication of thy conquest in fundamental harmonies. A
primeval element art thou not, but a physical investiture of the
shifting soul. Thou art the master of this hour--yea, even of the
unconscious Brünnhilde and the equally unconscious Wagner. He builded
better than he knew. The seed of the serpent hath bruised the heel of
the woman.




III--BACK-WORLDS GODS AND OVER-WOMAN

  And those same torches, flaring by her bed,
  Lighted her downward path among the dead.

  MELEAGER.

  (_Translated by_ JANE MINOT SEDGWICK.)


The drama of "Siegfried" opens with a reintroduction of one of
Wagner's most subtle studies. Mime in "Rheingold" plays almost no
part at all. There the local interest of Niebelheim is centred
in that peevish parody of Napoleonic ambition, Alberich, whose
curse is launched upon the entire succeeding series of incidents.
In "Siegfried" Alberich is shown to us a helpless watcher on the
outskirts of events, the complement of the wondering Wotan.

Both of the principal workers on the beginning of the web have been
forced to let the threads slip from their feeble hands. Siegfried,
the young, hot-blooded embodiment of humanity, and Mime, the last
receptacle of underground craft and cunning, struggle for the
supremacy. Alberich is absurd.

The battle of the dwarfs in the first scene of the second act is
one of Wagner's pieces of grotesquery. Did he see the ridiculous
aspect of it? One can hardly believe so. He seems to take it very
seriously, but it refuses to be serious. Mime, however, is a genuine
creation. Search opera from its inception to the disclosure of this
extraordinary work and you will not find another such product of the
imagination. Mime is the perfect type of a low cunning mind plotting
to use a noble and generous nature for its own ends and then to
consign that nature to destruction.

A ward politician or a Wall Street operator Mime might have been in
a more advanced state of society. It was his misfortune and not his
fault that he was born a cave-dweller. Wagner falls into ludicrous
difficulties in his endeavors to disclose the inner workings of
this nature. In the first act he has recourse to the old-fashioned
operatic duet, in which two persons standing at opposite sides of the
stage bellow antagonistic sentiments at the top of their lungs, yet
do not hear each other.

The factitious veritism of the music drama crumbles into absurdity
in the presence of this illogical scene. Wagner as frankly asks us
to accept the unreal conventions of the stage as ever did Donizetti
or Meyerbeer. And this, too, in the midst of his most elaborate and
pretentious creation. But here again music, heavenly maid, saves
the situation. The splendor of the climax of the forging episode
dazzles judgment. One cannot analyze the dramatic verities when his
heart is thumping under his ribs with the trip-hammer rhythm of this
tremendous composition.

In the second act, when Mime is endeavoring to induce Siegfried to
take the potion, we are asked to understand that the bird has warned
Siegfried, and that the hero is enabled to discern behind Mime's
utterances the real meanings which he strives to conceal. Wagner's
conception was dramatically impracticable, and so he makes Mime utter
his secret thoughts aloud, so that we, as well as Siegfried, may know
them.

It is a cumbersome and feeble device. Here again, however, the music
comes to the dramatist's aid. The exquisitely artistic contrast
between the craft and malice of Mime and the ingenuousness of the
youthful hero is expressed perfectly by the opposing natures of their
musical measures, and a final touch of most eloquent suggestion is
supplied by the half-whispered instrumental repetition of the bird
phrase. This is dramatic music of the most potent.

The keynote of Mime is sounded in the orchestra in the beginning of
Act I. with the motive of reflection,--that hollow, sinister duet
of two bassoons, so devilish, so serpentine in the mockery of its
descending thirds. Whoever before heard the lascivious harmony of the
third made to chant a psalm of mischief? Deep reflection, far-sighted
wickedness, lies in those few sinister, sepulchral notes, and as the
curtain rises and shows us the shaggy little elf bent hopeless over
his forging and searching his evil mind for some solution of the
problem of the lost hoard, we fall with him into a frame of mind fit
for treasons.

And Loge? Is the embodiment of craft absent? Not he. Loge deserts not
his kind. In the flickering flame of the forge he lurks in waiting.
He will weld the sword "Nothung," which was shivered on Wotan's
spear, and this time it will shatter that spear and break the power
of the futile and disappearing gods. Loge will answer the call of
Siegfried and rise in his might. Joyously will he blaze to melt the
splinters, for this forging is but another act in the drama of his
triumph. How can the dotard Wotan sit by the hearthstone playing at
riddles with Mime and not feel the breath of Loge on his neck?

What a new and unheard of thing is the vocal style of Mime! The
creation of this weird recitation is one of Wagner's most notable
achievements. The sharp, cackling treble staccato, which sinks ever
and anon into an indescribable gurgle of subterranean low tones and
again rises to a shrill and infantile falsetto,--this is something
that no old-time musician, who appealed to the outward ear alone,
could ever have conceived. Its importance in the expression of
grotesque and grim humor cannot be overestimated. It is neither
speech nor song. It is not recitative. It is not declamation. It is
simply the snarling, the barking, the whining of malice, cowardice,
and sneaking treachery. It is the very thing itself that Wagner
sought. It was a triumph of genius.

Has it ever occurred to you, gentle reader, that up to the last act
of "Siegfried" this same music of Mime supplies the only psychologic
element in the play so far as the musical part is concerned? Mime is
the one scheming, introspective character in the work. Every musical
thought in the score which is connected with him reveals an inner
life. The rest is nearly all scenic or external music.

Siegfried's entrance is bodied forth in a gust of forest freshness
sweeping into the noisome air of the cavern. The famous wanderlied of
the youth is not introspective. It breathes not the yearning of the
hero for a free life, but the spirit of the unbounded world itself.
It is a song of the receding horizon.

The bandying of conundrums between Wotan and Mime leaves all
the psychology to the dwarf. The rest is commemorative. It is a
repetition of old themes to recall Siegmund and Sieglinde, the
Giants and their unrequited labor, Walhall and its vanishing
limelight glories. Take again the opening scene of Act II. How
much introspection is there in Wotan's interesting interview with
the unseen Fafner? Atmospheric, indeed, this music is, but not
psychologic. It has a very suspicious resemblance to the famous scene
before the tomb of Ninus in "Semiramide." But it is conducted more
decorously, and instead of "Oh, horror!" we hear the more comforting
"Lass't mich schlafen."

In the scene which follows we are presented with the picture of the
young hero reclining under a linden tree and reflecting on his unique
position in the primeval world. He hears the murmur of the wind among
the branches of the trees and watches the shadows play at hide and
seek. The music is purely descriptive and scenic. A bird carols among
the foliage. It is a strain of unaffected melody, and surely none
would affront a cheerful birdling by charging it with psychologic
intent.

The young man, seeking for some channel of cheerful communication
with his own antecedents, tries to fashion a pipe on which to imitate
the bird's lay. In vain. So, forth with the familiar waldhorn and
therewith wind a challenging blast. How did Siegfried learn his own
musical theme? There is a psychologic tangle here, but it was in
the thinking of Wagner, not in that of the hero. Siegfried had no
business to know that there was an orchestra and that he had a theme.
But let that pass.

Behold Fafner, clad in the shapeless form of a thing that never
was, lumbering out of the cavern and wagging his sapient head and
bannered tail with the aid of all too visible wires. Oh, Siegfried
and Fafner, Fafner and Siegfried, which of ye is the more comic? Was
it not cruel to place a "treasure of the world," a "smiling hero,"
in such a position, to make him do combat amid hissing steam and the
shock of thunderous battle music with a most disillusioning dragon of
papier-maché? Again hear the external music, the sword and the vigor
of the young man.

After the fight the bird sings once more, this time in a soprano
voice and with text. Mime enters and psychology reappears. After
Mime's death, more external music, till the bird tells of the
enchanted Princess asleep on the mountain top, and then there is
a burst of hot blood, a rush of musical energy which has in it
something more than mere external description. Nevertheless, in all
music there is nothing else which so clearly demonstrates the ease
with which the purely pictorial in the tone art may be confounded
with the introspective as this second act of "Siegfried," for here
the mood of nature and the mood of the chief actor, whose soul is to
be laid bare, are one.

With the opening of Act III. we have the scene between Wotan and
Erda. Here, again, the character of the music is chiefly descriptive.
The storm is contrasted with the vague tonalities and muted voicing
of Erda's music. After the spear of Wotan is shattered by the
rewelded "Nothung," Loge fills the mountains with his radiance and
his shimmering music. The last of the futile and disappearing gods
has passed from the scene of action. The human drama which is to
lead to the dusk of the high ones has begun. Loge's labor is almost
completed.

With the change from the pealing music to which Siegfried ascends
the mountain to the long-drawn strains of the strings which lead
him to the couch of his desire, we enter upon a scene of soul
revelation. What a marvellous inspiration of genius is the awakening
of Brünnhilde! She went to sleep a weeping, supplicating goddess,
deprived of her divinity. She wakes to the majestic chords which
announce her assumption of a grander divinity, the might and majesty
of perfect womanhood. The duo between her and Siegfried is all
psychologic, not subtle, for the blazing of passion is not subtle,
but none the less the delineation of an inward state.

Of all the dramas of the tetralogy "Siegfried" is that in which pure
beauty is most plentiful. Here is a problem for musical philosophers.
Is Strauss not a maker, but a product? Is the embodiment of subtle
psychologic problems in tone hostile to unaffected beauty? Must the
lyric drama follow the march of symphonic music into the screaming
regions of the Strauss soul analysis? "Siegfried" is quite devoid
of the elements of tragedy. The death of Fafner is not tragic; on
the contrary, it is comic. There is even a touch of bathos in the
dying speech of the transmogrified Bottom of the Wagnerian drama. The
conundrum scene is childish. The bird belongs to the world of the
infantile fairy tale. But the spirit of buoyant youth is in the work.
Its music is nearly all external, and unaffectedly beautiful.

"Siegfried," revelling in purely descriptive music, devoid of mental
sickness contracted from much study of Schopenhauer or Nietzsche,
breathes the spirit of a free world's youth.

Little is left to be said, or much, for "Götterdämmerung" must be
treated as a separate drama or dismissed shortly in the light of
what has already been written. In this drama we come to the drawing
together of the threads, the stretto of the dream fugue. Behold
Brünnhilde, who has given all her wisdom to Siegfried and hence has
none left for herself, sending him out in quest of further reputation
as a mighty hero. There is something pathetic in this and also
pitiably modern. Must husbands have had outings in the elemental days
even as now? Was the epic man inconstant of soul? Ah Brünnhilde! A
wise woman would go with him. It is not good for man to be alone.

Siegfried arrives at the domicile of the desirable Gibichung family
and accepts an unknown drink from a pretty girl he never saw before.
His rusticity beams from his guileless countenance, and to Hagen, the
experienced one, he is as the ripe pear on the low-hanging bough.
Pitiable weakling Siegfried! Call ye this a hero of all the world?
Pitiable Gunther, you do well to swear blood brotherhood with him.
You are a well-mated pair. Pitiable Gutrune! Siegfried was not for
you, though your drink did make him forget that he remembered and
dream that he forgot.

In the hands of Hagen, the only really clever person in the drama,
these three are as clay in the hands of the potter. Hagen could not
command success, because Loge was more powerful than he, and the
ultimate ruin of the gods would have been deferred had Hagen gained
possession of the accursed ring; but he deserved success, and that,
as Sempronius was long ago informed, was something worthy of respect.

Two elements of this final drama remain confronting us. They are
the most tremendous of all Wagner's heroines, the completed woman,
Brünnhilde, and the most potent of all psychologic music outside of
"Tristan und Isolde." When Siegfried, in the end of the drama bearing
his name, hurls the flood of human love at the reduced Valkyr, he
awakens in her that which lifts her above principalities and kingdoms.

          "Indeed I love thee. Come,
  Yield thyself up--my hopes and thine are one:
  Accomplish thou my manhood and thyself;
  Lay thy sweet hands in mine and trust to me."

Almost might Tennyson have substituted his words for those of Wagner,
and truly they are more graceful. In "Götterdämmerung" we find
Brünnhilde with her womanhood completed. Filled full to the lips
and eyes with love, she is risen to a majesty which as the laughing
Valkyr she never knew. Compared with her Olympian splendor, the
fumbling weakness of her sire becomes indeed pitiable. With what
heroine is she to be compared? Set her for a moment over against
Isolde, who also died upon her true love's body.

The philosophy of negation which saturates "Tristan und Isolde" is
a deadly foe to your piping enthusiasm. The draining of the cup of
death, averted by the temporizing policy of the silly Brangäne, would
never have assumed the tragic proportions of Brünnhilde's terrible
oath upon the spear. The wounded love of Isolde dwindles to petulance
when brought to the side of the outraged majesty of the chaste and
glorious Valkyr wife.

Look upon the two in the last scenes of their respective tragedies.
Isolde lays her down to die of a broken heart beside her dead lover,
hymning in rapt ecstatic phrase, seeing in the vision of her own
dissolution the new light streaming from his eyes and his heart
beating in his chilled breast. It is sweet, so sweet. It is more
honeyed than the dirge of Shelley for Adonais, or the exquisitely
musical "Archete, Sikelikai, to pentheon archete, Moisai," of
Moschus over the ashes of Bion. It is love's threnody in the realms
of eternal moonlight, where the cypress shadows of a pessimistic
philosophy shelter the lemur of blank negation.

Brünnhilde, too, beholds the sunny light streaming from her hero's
dead eyes, but how her apostrophe to him rings with brave and hopeful
praise! There is no sweating sickness of the soul here, but the
proclamation of a grand personality. And then through prayer this
supreme woman passes to prophecy:

  "Ye gods who guard
  Our gazes for ever,
  Turn not away
  From my waxing distress."

And but a moment later that sublime passage:

    "All things, all things
      All I wot now:
    All at once is made clear!
      Even thy ravens
    I hear rustling:
  To tell the longed-for tidings
  Let them return to their home.
  Rest thee! Rest thee, oh god!"

And again:

      "Fly home, ye ravens!
      Rede it in Walhalla
  What here on the Rhine ye have heard!
      To Brünnhilde's rock
      Go round about,
      Yet Loge burns there:
  Walhalla bid him revisit!
      Draweth near in gloom
      The Dusk of the Gods.
      Thus, casting my torch,
      I kindle Walhall's towers."

Ah, Isolde! How every man that has a heart can echo that marvellous
phrase with which Wagner makes Tristan breathe forth his first
and last sigh of love insatiable! Queen of the tawny locks and
stately tread, thou art first shown to us as a woman of the old
barbaric grandeur, hurling the full tide of thy passions against the
inexorable advancing prow of Fate. The gates of honor thrown down,
thou art but a woman loved and loving; and, mourning over thy lost
chastity, art ready to sink into fathomless night with Tristan. After
all, thou comest to the pale estate of chill despair and so diest,
hymning a last sad canticle of love.

Isolde is beautiful, winsome, desirable. Men love her, but she
does not dominate. Brünnhilde grows from a laughing light-elf to be
a stricken woman, and thence is raised by the might of love to the
majestic height of abstract womanhood divine. Isolde is a diminuendo;
Brünnhilde a crescendo. In her last estate she stands disclosed in
overmastering splendor, and mortal man in the honesty of his secret
heart knows that, in the presence of such womanhood as this, he is
utterly unworthy. And so we come to the end. Brünnhilde has joined
hands with Loge and the "Rheingold" prophecy of Erda is fulfilled.
The spirit of evil has become the renovator of the earth and all
things are purified by fire. And the music! What majestic development
of the Erda theme is this we hear in the Dusk of the Gods motive?
There, indeed, is a psychological development, equalled only by the
extraordinary mystic effects of the combination in Act I. of the
themes of forgetfulness and the tarnhelm, by the wonderful recitative
of the transformed Siegfried posing as Gunther, and by that highest
of all songs without words, the funeral march.

The retirement of the futile and disappearing gods forces the
purely human element to the front. The tragedy steadily waxes in
power as the feeble ones of Walhalla grow fainter and the humans take
the threads in their hands, till finally the one great, majestic
creation of the whole trilogy is seen to be Brünnhilde, the eternal
womanhood personified, the light of the world and the glory of
Walhalla.




ISOLDE'S SERVING-WOMAN

              The daughter of debate,
  That discord aye doth sowe.

  _Verses by Queen Elizabeth in_ PERCY'S  _Reliques_.


It is an inquiring age. We investigate the domestic habits of
the poet or the sandpiper with equal zest. We analyze dress and
intellectual states with the keenest delight. Upon all things we
speculate, ponder, ring the changes of scrutinizing comment. Thus
it chanced upon a day that certain learned Thebans, sitting in the
solemn conclave of educational chop-houses, fell upon disputatious
views of the profound character of Brangäne in Wagner's "Tristan und
Isolde," and there were diverse theories.

Strange it seems to the calm and unprejudiced observer that there
should be difference of opinion as to the character of Brangäne. To
be sure, the weary mind of the hardened critic never hopes to receive
highly intelligent views on such questions from casual or even
habitual opera-goers.

When this writer presumed to object to the richness of Edyth
Walker's costume as Brangäne, he was told that the woman was of
noble birth and that she was not Isolde's maid, but her companion.
Also he was told that Miss Walker's costume was approved in Vienna,
which concerned him not a jot, seeing that the authority for the
interpretation of Brangäne does not rest in Vienna, but in the poem
of Wagner.

Louise Homer's conception of Brangäne was deplored by some of the
learned Thebans in that it was not heroic. Where are Brangäne's
heroics in the drama? Marie Brema, who soared through the New World
with a contralto voice and a soprano ambition, always acted Brangäne
as if she were a sister of Isolde. She conceived the pleading of the
tirewoman in the spirit of the third act of "Die Walküre." But there
was no Wotan to kiss the godhood or the scales from her eyes.

Marianne Brandt of blessed memory smote the harp with no uncertain
hand. She knew the meaning of Brangäne in those now far-off days when
Lili Lehmann was Isolde, Albert Niemann Tristan, Robinson Kurvenal,
and Fischer King Mark. "And there were giants in those days." But it
is not a question of personal authority. It is a question of direct
examination of the poem, of the significance of the drama.

In these days no one studies a Wagnerian play solely at first hand.
Is Kundry to be explained? Then search the Scriptures. Read all the
old poems, delve among the legends, turn up the sods of centuries.
Is Parsifal to be analyzed? Plunge into the Oriental forests and
emerge with your Aryan expulsion and return formula; co-ordinate your
poetic axes; parallel column your Siegfried, your Ulysses, and your
guileless fool. Heaven be thanked, Brangäne is not a mighty heroine
of antique fable. She is but a parhelion which dwells near the sun.
We may dispose of her with little effort.

Brangäne is not heroic. There is not a line in Wagner's text to
justify such a conception of the character. Wagner's Brangäne is
a maid, a serving-woman. She is simple-minded, even innocent. In
some respects she is foolish. Her one dominating note is devotion
to her mistress. She is doglike in nature. She is Isolde's feminine
Kurvenal. But she lacks in every essential the emotional and
intellectual initiative of Tristan's esquire. She is passive. She
is necessarily thus. From the point of view of dramatic character
construction she must be so in order to afford an effective foil to
Isolde, with whom she is continually placed in contrast. In more
subtle but none the less influential opposition does she stand to
Kurvenal, the embodiment of active, working devotion to the master.
Brangäne does nothing but what she is bid, and does that wrong.

Her simple-minded innocence leads her to become what the dramatist
needs to complete his scheme, an unconscious agent of fate. Acting
wholly under the influence of devotion to her mistress, and
without sufficient wisdom to foresee the terrible consequences of
her deed, she administers to the lovers the potion which drowns
their self-control and plunges them into the sea of passion. She
does this on the unthinking impulse of the moment, solely because
she is frightened out of such wits as she has by her mistress's
determination to share with Tristan the drink of death.

Is that a heroic act? Would not a heroic nature have grasped the
significance of the moment, and, foreseeing the approaching shame,
have acquiesced in Isolde's decision? Nay, more; filled with such
devotion as that of Brangäne, raised to a divine ecstasy by innate
heroism, she would have swallowed her share of the poison and laid
her down at her lady's feet to die, as Kurvenal did at Tristan's.

But there is not a single element of the heroic in Brangäne. She is,
if anything, a coward, or at least a temporizer. The makeshift of the
moment is what appears most desirable to her. Her naïve mind, which
was so astonished to learn that the Tantris she helped to nurse was
the Tristan she had just addressed, could project itself into the
future no further than the next quarter of an hour. If that chanced
to be a bad one, no matter. Those which were to follow were all blank
for the good Brangäne.

So must it be, for in all versions of the story except that
mysterious one which Scribe unearthed for use in Auber's "Le
Philtre," and which reappears in the first act of Donizetti's
"L'Elisir d'Amore," the potion is taken by the two lovers
unwittingly. It is administered by mistake. Wagner has accentuated
his meaning as to the character of Brangäne by modifying this feature
of the legend. His Brangäne does not give the love potion by mere
mistake, but in order to save her lady's life. To enact her as a
heroic personage makes her exchange of the potions inexplicable. Yet
Wagner did not wholly abandon the notion of a mistake, for Brangäne's
error in preferring Isolde's dishonor to her death is surely a
mistake of the direst kind.

In the poem of Gottfried von Strassbourg--here let us fall into
the widening trail of the historic exploration party--Brangäne does
not give the potion at all. Neither is she a maid. She is a lady of
high position at the court of Isolde's mother and in the confidence
of the Queen. This Queen is a magician and gives the love potion to
Brangäne to administer to Isolde and King Mark as soon as they are
wed. On the voyage, Tristan, desiring wine, calls for it, and a maid
attending the Princess brings to him the phial containing the potion.
It looks like wine, and neither Tristan nor the maid suspects that
it is anything else. Isolde, too, knows naught of it. Then, says
Gottfried:--

  "To Tristan first she passed the same:
  He gave it to the royal dame.
  Thereof she drank reluctantly,
  Gave it to him, and then drank he;
  That wine it was they both believed.
  Then came Brangäne, who perceived
  And recognized at once the glass;
  She well saw what had come to pass.
  Thereon she felt such dire dismay
  That all her strength was giving way,
  And she appeared as are the dead;
  Her heart was filled with mortal dread.
  She seized the baleful glass she knew,
  And bore it hence away and threw
  It in the wildly raging sea.
  'Oh, woe!' she spoke, 'Oh, woe is me,
  That in this world I e'er was born,
  I wretched one! Now I am shorn
  Of troth and honor which were mine.
  Have pity on me, Lord divine;
  Oh, that I came unto this shore
  And death took me not hence before--
  That with Isold my lot was e'er
  This fatal enterprise to share!
  Oh, woe, Isold! Woe, Tristan, too!
  This draught is death to both of you.'"

This Brangäne afterward explains to these two sudden lovers what
has happened to them, and reiterates that the draught will be their
death. Tristan declares that he will die happy possessing Isolde's
love. But it is unnecessary to pursue the original legend further.
Enough has been given to show that the Brangäne of Gottfried is not
the Brangäne of Wagner.

Again we meet with one of those effective modifications of the old
stories which Wagner made in his dramas. The splendid figure of the
Queen mother's confidante bewailing her momentary unwatchfulness and
her loss of honor, ready for the sake of that betrayal of confidence
to give up her now wretched life, is a vastly different creature from
the Brangäne of Wagner, who administers the potion as the shortest
way out of an impending trouble.

Again, remember that this deed is one of pure unthinking devotion
to the mistress. The fatal drink is the visible embodiment of fate.
Appearing as it does in inanimate form, it needs an agent to convey
it to the four lips of the lovers. That agent is found in the
foolish, doting maid. Is it not a purely Wagnerian touch?

Even Swinburne, poet of far higher fancy than Wagner, did not think
of such a plan. He improves on the old legend by making Isolde
herself administer the potion in error:--

  "Iseult sought and would not wake Brangwain,
  Who slept as one half dead with fear and pain,
  Being tender natured; so with hushed light feet
  Went Iseult round her, with soft looks and sweet
  Pitying her pain; so sweet a spirited thing
  She was, and daughter of a kindly king.
  And spying what strange bright secret charge was kept
  Fair in that maid's white bosom while she slept,
  She sought and drew the gold cup forth and smiled,
  Marvelling, with such light wonder as a child
  That hears of glad, sad life in magic lands;
  And bear it back to Tristram with pure hands
  Holding the love draught that should be for flame
  To burn out of them fear and faith and shame."

Iseult speaks merrily of the wile of Brangwain in concealing this,
the best wine of the feast. Then they drink, and the world is made
anew. Here again the agency for the supply of the potion is error.
Wagner could not have built his tragedy on such mighty lines if he
had left that thought out. His Tristan and Isolde were standing
on the brink of a volcanic crater; something was needed to impel
them into it. That something was found in the foolish love of the
simple-minded Brangäne.

The first act of Wagner's tragedy tells all that is to be told of
the serving-woman. She stands disclosed at the very outset as a
sublimated comprimaria. She is the titanic Alice to this mighty
Lucia, marching to her marriage with one man when she loves another.
To this Alice this Lucia tells how she learned to love in days now
buried in the sweet and unforgotten past. The comprimaria of the old
Italian opera walked about with the prima donna and gave her cues.
This new comprimaria follows the same lines, but in how different a
manner! Wagner was indeed the regenerator of the lyric drama. Verdi
knew it. His Emilia would have been an old-fashioned comprimaria had
he written "Otello" in his "Traviata" days.

First, this maid, alarmed at Isolde's passionate prayer that the
ship and all in it may be destroyed ere they reach Mark's land,
asks what has caused her mistress to be so downcast throughout the
voyage. Then she is amazed to learn that Tantris is Tristan, and that
her mistress does not wish to be led by him to the couch of Mark.
She even offers some cheap, prosaic, and senseless worldly counsel.
"If Tristan is under any obligation to you, how can he discharge it
better than by making you Mark's queen? Even if he himself did the
wooing for his uncle, why should you object? He's a gentleman of rank
and reputation." This innocent maid does not even catch the tragic
meaning of Isolde's

          "Ungeminnt
          Den hehrsten Mann
  Stets mir nah' zu sehen--
  Wie konnt' ich die Qual bestehen?"

"Unloved by the lordliest man, yet always near him, how could I bear
that anguish?" This "heroic" Brangäne applies this speech to King
Mark and reminds Isolde of the casket of enchanted drinks provided
by her mother. When Isolde proclaims that the drink of death is
that which she will use, the situation is entirely beyond the
comprehension of the maid. She cries: "The drink, for whom? Tristan?
Oh, horror!"

The score is significantly barren of explicit stage directions about
the substitution of the potion of love for that of death. But there
is no question as to what ought to be done. Wagner on more than one
occasion fell into the error of leaving too much to the imagination
of the public. It is absolutely essential to the understanding of
"Tristan und Isolde" by an audience that Brangäne should with the
greatest possible clearness exhibit the exchange of the drinks. She
should show convincingly, by facial expression and gesture, the
sudden formation of the idea of the substitution, and she should
be particular to force the act of exchange upon the attention of
the audience. Otherwise the subsequent actions of the two lovers
are inexplicable to many, for the common experience of the theatre
teaches that the points of a drama must be not merely indicated, but
driven home; and the whole tragedy of "Tristan und Isolde" rests upon
the love potion.

The potion once swallowed, Brangäne, who, "confused and shuddering,"
has been leaning over the ship's rail, turns and bursts out with a
cry: "Woe, woe! Unpreventable endless trouble instead of brief death!"

This wise and heroic Brangäne, seeing the bride of Mark in the arms
of Tristan, and knowing that they are the victims of her temporizing
policy, bewails what she has done and suddenly discovers that death
would have been better. The English translations do not bring this
passage out clearly, yet it is of vital importance in explaining the
character of Isolde's maid.

In the second act Brangäne is shown to us the victim of her own
ceaseless terrors. Day and night she cowers under the shadow of
the impending axe. Her mind being stimulated by her fears for her
mistress and her own remorse, she plays the spy and tracks the
traitor Melot to his lair.

But all in vain. The barriers are burned away. The blood of Isolde
is become as lava in her veins. She knows naught in all the world
but the mad delirium of passion. Isolde will extinguish the torch.
Brangäne pleads, and cries: "Oh that I had not once been faithless
and false to my mistress's will! If I had only remained dumb and
blind, _thy_ work had been death! Now, as it is, thy shame, thy most
shameful trouble, _my_ work,--thus must I, blameworthy, know it."

Not very heroic that! Brangäne wishes she had kept out of the whole
affair. Then the death of Tristan and Isolde would have been the
latter's act. Now this poor maid feels that her policy of temporizing
has caused all the trouble and brought her beloved mistress into a
shameful position. That is practically all of Brangäne.

One little speech in the third act shows that she is still
reproaching herself for her weakness. She has gone to the King and
atoned for her "blind guilt," as she calls it, by explaining to him
the cause of the loss of honor by Tristan and Isolde.

In the entire text of Wagner there is nothing to indicate that he
intended Brangäne to be regarded as anything but a simple-minded
serving-woman, deeply attached to her mistress, acting in the matter
of the potions on a blind and instantaneous impulse to save her
mistress from death and murder. She is naïve in thought, superficial
in reasoning, straightforward in emotion, and altogether transparent
as crystal. Kurvenal's devotion to Tristan is essentially a masculine
devotion, ready to face death, deploring dishonor, but not forsaking
even in the face of shame. Kurvenal serves with heart and life.
Brangäne serves with heart and subterfuge.

A vast amount of ill-informed feminine twitter is accepted as
learned comment on such characters as Brangäne. All that is necessary
to a full understanding of this or any other Wagnerian personage is
a careful examination of the text and music. The text should always
be the original German, for the libretto translators have played
havoc with it. Brangäne's most significant wail, "Unpreventable
endless trouble instead of quick death," is usually translated in a
misleading manner.




                           RICHARD STRAUSS


                      I. THE HISTORICAL SURVEY

            Theorbos, violins, French horns, guitars,
            Leave in my wounded ears inflicted scars.

                                    CHARLES LAMB  to _Clara N._

For some seasons the orchestral compositions of Richard Strauss have
been the exciting features of the leading orchestral concerts. They
have fairly set the musical _cognoscenti_ by the ears. The strenuous
German artist is yet a young man, and what he may achieve in an
uncertain future is a fruitful subject for critical speculation.
What he has already done is to stir up the musical world as it has
not been stirred since Richard Wagner proclaimed his regenerative
theories of the musical drama. Strauss has turned the technic of
orchestral composition topsy-turvy, and has made orchestras sing new
songs. He has in certain ways discredited Beethoven and the prophets,
and has shrunk the orchestral wonders of Berlioz and Wagner to the
dimensions of a Sunday afternoon band concert. He has caused the
critical heathen to rage and the long-haired people to imagine vain
things. In fine, the simple question now frankly discussed in the
sacred circles of the inner brotherhood is just this: "Is Richard
Strauss a heaven-born genius, or is he merely crazy?"

Usually when musical composers have ventured out of the beaten
path, just found by the critics after much thorny wandering through
the jungle of error, the cry has been that they were going astray.
The poor critics have never been able to understand how any genius
could depart from the beaten path without being lost in the woods,
as they themselves generally are. In nine cases out of ten the
composer who does so depart is lost, and hence the critic's calling
is not altogether one of sorrow. The prophet who has ninety per
cent of "I told you so" in his retrospective views is not wholly a
subject for commiseration. But there is that tenth man, who is always
an explorer, and who always sets to cutting new paths through the
forest. The critic says, "You're going to get lost," and he replies,
"I may lose you, but not myself." After a time he comes out of the
forest into a new and beautiful land, and the critic, limping slowly
and painfully after him, murmurs, "You were right: it is good for us
to be here."

And so the music critics, who long ago reduced their comments on
Beethoven and Weber and Schubert and Schumann to an exact science,
and who have made it possible for any old reader to predict precisely
what will be said on the morning after a purely classical concert,
have fallen over the music of Strauss into a confusion like unto
that of the army of Pharaoh suddenly overtaken by the waters of
the Red Sea. It was about twelve years ago that this music began
to echo through the concert-rooms of America. Strauss had begun to
write early in life, but his first works were imitative of the older
masters. The real Richard Strauss began to reveal himself in 1887,
when he produced "Macbeth," the first of his series of symphonic
poems. The others are Don Juan (1888), Death and Apotheosis (1889),
Till Eulenspiegel's Merry Pranks (1895), Thus Spake Zarathustra
(1896), Don Quixote (1897), and A Hero's Life (1898). The "Symphonia
Domestica," which is really a tone poem, was produced at Carnegie
Hall, New York, March 21, 1904.

What has Strauss done in these works to "so get the start of the
majestic world"? He has asked us to listen to orchestral compositions
made with wide deviations from the established outlines, with a
new melodic idiom, with a harmony which frequently affects the ear
precisely as lemon juice affects the palate, with instrumental
combinations of overpowering sonority and harshness, and, above all,
with attempts at a detailed definiteness of expression which demand
the closest application of the hearer's powers of analysis.

He has excited curiosity of the liveliest kind among those who hold
that there is a real difference "'twixt tweedledum and tweedledee."
To those who accept music, as they accept soup, as one of the
conventional details of a polite existence, all this pother about
Strauss must seem unnecessary, yet since it has come, they naturally
desire to know what it is all about. They must, then, begin by
recognizing the fact that the modern orchestra has developed from
a collection of ill-assorted and misunderstood instruments into a
single instrument, the most eloquent at the disposal of the composer.
It is majestic in power, royal in dignity, brilliant in gayety,
convulsing in sport, inspiring in appeal, melting in supplication.
Its variety of tonal shades is exhaustless. Its scale ranges from the
profoundest bass to the acutest treble. Its dynamic power modulates
from the faintest whisper of a pianissimo to the thunderous crash of
a fortissimo. It sings, it laughs, it weeps, it woos, it storms, it
hymns, it meditates,--all at the command of the composer who knows
how to utilize its powers.

Yet it is still an imperfectly understood instrument. Remember always
that music is the youngest of our modern arts. Remember, too, that
although we can trace its beginnings back to the fourth century of
the Christian era, we find that twelve hundred years were occupied
with the development of a single form of music,--vocal polyphony,
the form in which the mighty masterpieces of the Roman Church down
to the day of Lasso and Palestrina were composed. The masters of
this vocal polyphony were engaged in studying how they could compose
for the liturgy of the church music in which several voice-parts,
each singing a melody, could sound simultaneously and yet produce
agreeable harmonies. The discovery of the principles underlying this
method was made slowly, yet it was essential that this discovery
should be made. Without it musical art could not advance, for the
laws of counterpoint and harmony are the first principles of musical
art.

Toward the close of the sixteenth century a change came over
the spirit of music. The mass of the Roman Church had become
so complicated and ornate in its style of composition that the
congregations did not know what words of the liturgy were sung. The
revival of Greek learning in Italy brought with it the study of the
Greek Testament in the original, and this study revealed the defects
of the Vulgate used by the church. A blow at Latin was a blow at
the authority of the church, and the questionings aroused by the
revelations of the Greek Testament touched the mass, and made the
people desirous of hearing the text and knowing what it was about.
Such a demand called for a simplification of musical style. This
demand was strengthened by the invention of printing. The people
began to get books and to read, and that led them to think and
inquire. Furthermore the chaste beauty of Greek art had become known,
and its influence promoted the simplification of musical style in the
church. The broad and dignified hymns employed by the great reformer,
Martin Luther, were another powerful argument in favor of simpler
music in the sanctuary. The church was not blind to the signs of the
time, and its composers made some efforts toward clarifying their
style.

The revival of Greek learning led also to an attempt to resuscitate
the dead Greek drama, or rather to reconstruct the Italian play
on its lines. The fact that the Greeks had chanted rather than
declaimed their dramatic texts suggested to the little band of
Italian enthusiasts led by Galilei, Peri, and Caccini, an attempt
to reproduce this musical delivery. Their efforts resulted in the
invention of dramatic recitative and the birth of opera. With the
advent of this form of vocal art the supremacy of church polyphony
was overthrown. It did not cease to exist, but it lost its dominion
over the musical world, and it almost stopped developing. To this day
the works of Palestrina composed in the second half of the sixteenth
century remain the model and the despair of church composers. Handel
and Bach, introducing more modern harmonies and employing the
resources of the orchestra, which Palestrina and his predecessors
never used, carried vocal polyphony a little further, but their
advance was external rather than fundamental.

It was at this stage of musical progress that the orchestra made its
appearance,--a feeble, tottering, purposeless instrumental infant.
Collections of instruments had of course existed. Millionaires of
the Middle Ages drowned the inanities of their dinner conversation
with banquet music, just as the moderns do. But their assemblies of
instruments were merely fortuitous. Any instruments which chanced to
be in the house, and for which there were players, were utilized.
There was no music specially written for these orchestras. We may
suppose that they played the popular tunes of the day. When the opera
came into existence, some sort of orchestra had to be extemporized.
Here again in the beginning any instruments easily accessible seem
to have been taken up. It was not till Claudio Monteverde began
his experiments in instrumental combinations in his operas in the
early part of the seventeenth century that anything like method in
instrumentation was discernible.

Monteverde began the exploration of the resources of each instrument
in characteristic expression. He endeavored to measure the powers
of the viol, the trumpet, the organ, and certain combinations of
instruments as illustrators of dramatic action. He invented some
of the now familiar tricks of orchestration, such as the tremolo
and the pizzicato. Furthermore he created an instrumental figure to
imitate the galloping of horses and another to depict the struggle
of a combat, and thus was really the artistic progenitor of Richard
Strauss, with his battle dins and his pirouetting maids. Succeeding
composers were not slow to follow the suggestions offered by the work
of Monteverde. The opera became a field for instrumental experiment,
and the orchestra, as employed by the operatic composers, was
continually in advance of the symphonic orchestra in the variety and
extent of its combinations and in the utilization of the special
powers of each individual instrument. This continued to be the case
up to the time of Liszt, Berlioz, and Wagner, when the technics
of conventional orchestration were so thoroughly established that
the demands of the new romantic school of composers affected the
orchestra simultaneously in opera and symphonic composition.

That the operatic orchestra should have taken the lead was perfectly
natural. When vocal polyphony was deposed from its supremacy,
instrumental music was in its infancy. Only the organ had achieved
anything approaching independence, and that was because all the
leading composers had been writing for the church and knew the church
instrument. For practice at home they used the clavichord, one of the
forerunners of the piano, and they began presently to compose special
music for it, but in the style of their organ music. Gradually they
fell into the way of writing for small groups of instruments, and
after a time the orchestra found its way from the opera house to the
church, and the orchestrally accompanied mass came into existence.
But meanwhile the composers who wrote for the clavier, with the aid
of those who wrote for the solo violin, were fashioning a form, and
after a time the sonata began to assume a definite shape. Now it was
borne in upon composers that their auditors would not arrive at the
opera in time to hear the overture, for operatic publics were much
the same then as they are now; and the poor composers had recourse to
writing their overtures so that they could be played independently
and having them performed at concerts. As these overtures were
written in a form founded upon the principles of the sonata form,
nothing was more natural than that gradually composers should be led
to the composition of complete sonatas for orchestra, and a sonata
for orchestra is a symphony.

In the middle of the eighteenth century, then, after Sebastian
Bach had carried the piano solo through the splendors of his "Well
Tempered Clavichord," and the piano sonata had attained something
like defined shape, we see Stammitz, Gossec, and, at length, Haydn
producing thin, tentative weakly orchestrated sonatas for orchestra,
and the real development of independent orchestral composition began.
This was nearly a century and a half after the birth of the orchestra
as an adjunct to the opera, and the same length of time after the
beginning of independent composition for the clavichord. In other
words, although the modern art of music may fairly be said to have
begun at least as early as the beginning of the twelfth century,
when the fundamental principles of counterpoint were enunciated by
the French masters, the most splendid and powerful of all musical
instruments, the orchestra, is to-day in its infancy. For if the
masters of vocal polyphony took some twelve centuries to elaborate
their science, it is fair to presume that, even though the general
laws of music are now firmly established, the technics of the
orchestra and of orchestral composition, which are a little over a
hundred years old, are yet by no means fully understood.

The method of composition employed by the early masters of
orchestral music was elaborate, yet not recondite. It was a system
of architecture in tones, and its achievements were distinctly
satisfying to the æsthetic discernment and to the appetite of
the human mind for a logical arrangement of ideas. Four parts or
movements were allotted to a symphonic work. Contrast of time,
rhythm, key, and harmonic color was sought. Each movement differed
from that next to it. Variety in unity was the ultimate object.
But each movement had to have a well-defined shape within itself.
Two melodic ideas, complementary to each other in key, rhythmic
nature, and sentiment, were invented. They were held up for the
inspection of the hearer at the beginning of the movement Then the
composer embarked upon what was called the "working out." He took the
essential features of his two melodies and juggled them through the
tricks of musical metamorphosis. He dressed them in new harmonies;
he made them writhe in the embraces of counterpoint; he expanded
them into new melodies; he sang them with the different voices of
the instrumental body. In the end he repeated them in their original
shape, and brought his movement to a close. The entire purpose was
the treatment of themes. The only aim was to make symmetrical,
intelligible, interesting music.

In evolving this form the composers fell, as I have said, into a
conventional use of their orchestra. They had three choirs, one of
wooden wind instruments, one of brass, and one of strings played
with bows. They allotted fixed functions to each choir and to the
members of each, and there they stopped. Occasionally a hint from
the operatic treatment of the instruments enlightened them and they
made a slight advance, but nevertheless, when Beethoven came to
write his symphonies, in which he attempted to make orchestral music
attain something more than mere musical beauty, he found himself
hampered by the conventionalities of symphonic orchestration, as
well as by those of the symphonic form. It was the limitation of the
form, indeed, which restrained the instrumentation. The form itself
had first reached definiteness with Haydn, who died when Beethoven
was thirty-nine. Only in his later years did Haydn learn the use of
clarinets, the most important members of the wood wind choir.

Beethoven, striving to make the symphony a vehicle for emotional
expression, was compelled to busy himself with changes in the form,
and he gave no special study to instrumental effects. He used such
new ones as readily suggested themselves to him, but they were
nothing more than elaborations of the old conventions. However, the
seed sown by Beethoven speedily bloomed in the growth of the new
romantic school. The principal tenet of this school was that music
must express emotions, and that the form must develop entirely
from the emotional purpose and plan of the work. Two distinguished
explorers of this new style devoted their highest efforts to the
production of orchestral composition.

Liszt endeavored to tell stories in music by erasing the dividing
line between movements and writing his work all in one piece. He
retained the two contrasting themes of the old symphonists, but
he asked his hearers to affix a meaning to each of them. Then he
proceeded to handle them in much the same way as the symphonists
did, working them out, and varying them with much skill, though
always with a view to suggesting the development of the incidents
of his story. To such a purpose the resources of orchestral color
lent mighty aid, and Liszt was not slow to perceive this. He began
to draw away from the conventions of the symphonists, and to seek
for new and striking instrumental combinations. Nevertheless in his
compositions for orchestra Liszt was the debtor of two men much more
remarkable than himself, namely, Wagner and Berlioz. From the former
he got the idea of the use of themes with definite meanings attached
to them. From the latter he obtained the suggestion of the employment
of the orchestra to tell stories and much information as to its
technics. Berlioz, however, continued the use of separate movements,
and his attempts to use definitely representative themes were few and
uncertain. He preceded Wagner, nevertheless, in the revelation of the
resources of the orchestra, and he antedated Liszt in the use of the
orchestra for romantic composition.

Later imitators of Berlioz and Liszt failed to perceive anything
except the vast color schemes of their orchestration. Borrowing a few
of the conventional figures of the older writers, such as Haydn's sea
waves and Beethoven's thunder-storms, they asked us to see things
through a kaleidoscope of instrumental color. They forgot that we
could not understand them when they made no logical appeal to our
intelligence.

Richard Strauss, standing upon the vantage ground made for him by
Berlioz, Liszt, and Wagner, has evidently tried to carry the direct
expression of the orchestra to a higher plane by utilizing the best
elements of their work. He has sought to make the orchestra tell
stories, but he has not made the error of supposing that he could
ignore the fundamental principles of musical form which constituted
the ground plan of the old symphony. He has utilized themes with
definite meanings attached to them, as Wagner did, without confining
himself to two, as the older writers did, and as Liszt did in most of
his works. He has returned in his later compositions to the fashion
of clearly separated movements, while he has made them pass before
the hearer without pauses between any two of them. He has developed
his themes according to the principles laid down by the symphonic
masters, and has striven to enforce their meaning with all the
effects of orchestral color. And withal he has endeavored to compose
only music with a purpose, never music for its own sake. In short,
Strauss has shown that the principles of musical form which the
earlier writers painfully evolved out of their attempts to produce
nothing beyond musical beauty, not only can be, but must be, utilized
by the composer who cares nothing whatever about musical beauty, and
who aims only at making music a means of expression.

This I believe to be Strauss's greatest and most significant
achievement. It is the legacy which he will leave to his successors,
and which will influence the progress of musical development.
His handling of the orchestra itself is a natural outgrowth of
the researches of Berlioz and Wagner. The former left little to
be learned about the capacity of each individual instrument; the
latter developed to an extraordinary degree the employment of many
voice-parts and the use of striking combinations. The early writers,
for example, used violins always in two parts, whereas Wagner
divided them sometimes into as many as fifteen. Flutes, oboes, and
clarinets were used by the classic masters in pairs; Wagner began to
employ them by threes. Strauss uses three or four of each. He makes
his orchestra sing in many parts, and he keeps the various voices
weaving and interweaving in marvellously learned counterpoint. When
he wants a great climax of sound, he gets one that is overwhelming.
Furthermore, he habitually introduces solo voices among the mass of
tone. He individualizes his instruments, and in some compositions
fairly casts them for definite dramatic impersonations. Musicians
will understand me when I add that he has asked every orchestral
player to be a virtuoso. He writes formidably difficult passages
for horns, for trombones, for oboes. He makes no concessions to the
technical difficulties of the instruments, as the older writers did.
He treats the instruments, as Wagner treated human voices, simply as
means of expression. The players must master the difficulties.

The critical quarrel with Strauss is based upon three grounds:
first, that he endeavors to make music tell a complete story; second,
that he seeks materials which are unsuited to musical embodiment;
and, third, that he writes ugly music. Composers have yielded to
the temptations of their fancies since the earliest days. Away back
in the fifteenth century, Jannequin tried to describe The Cries of
Paris in four-part vocal polyphony. Later composers fashioned piano
pieces which were supposed to tell whole histories. Ambros, the
distinguished German historian of music, felt it incumbent on him to
write a book to show where the communicative power of music ended
and the aid of text must be called in. Wagner declared that music
unassisted could go no further than Beethoven's symphonies, and that
the last movement of the Ninth Symphony was a confession of that fact.

It was long ago conceded that music could depict the broader
emotions. It has generally been denied that it could go into details
or explain to the hearer the causes of the feelings which it
expressed. Yet by the judicious use of titles and the establishment
of a connection between a composition and some well-known drama or
poem, the imagination of the hearer is stimulated to conceive the
meaning of many details otherwise incomprehensible. Strauss goes
the furthest in the elaboration of detail. He uses numerous themes,
each a guiding motive in the Wagnerian sense, and he asks us to
follow them through a myriad of musical workings out, all having
direct significance in telling a story. The stories are not without
unpleasant incidents and the music is rasping in its ugliness at
times. But this is not for us to judge. What is said of the music of
Strauss now was said twenty-five years ago of Wagner's. But a few
years, and the acidulated croakings of the singer of Munich may be
as sweet upon our ears as now are the endless melodic weavings of
"Tristan und Isolde."

Of the ideas which lie behind the music of Strauss less can be
said in opposition now than could be said five years ago. Then we
knew Strauss as the writer of "Don Juan," an attempt to put into
music the sensuality of a libertine, his final satiety, his utter
coldness of heart; of "Death and Apotheosis," a weird endeavor
to portray with an orchestra the horrors of dissolution, the
gasps, the struggles, the death-rattle, the _tremor mortis_; "Till
Eulenspiegel's Merry Pranks," a study in musical depiction of
wandering vulgarity, of jocular obscenity, a vast and coruscating
jumble of instrumental cackles about things unfit to be mentioned.
We felt that the nineteenth century was closing with something like
midsummer madness in art. With Ibsens, Maeterlincks, and Strausses
plucking like soulless ghouls upon the snapping heart-strings of
humanity, treating the heart as a monochord for the scientific
measurement of intervals of pain, and finally poking with their
skeleton fingers in the ashes of the tomb to see if they could not
find a single smouldering ember of human agony, we had attained a
rare state of morbidity in art. We felt that when Art had turned for
her inspiration to the asylum, the brothel, and the pesthouse, it
was time for a new renaissance. Strauss was our musical Maeterlinck,
our tonal Ibsen. Vague, indefinable fancies, grotesque and monstrous
mysticisms, gaunt shapes and shapeless horrors, seemed to be his
substitutes for clean, strong, pure ideals; and when he set to music
Friedrich Nietzsche's "Thus Spake Zarathustra," the philosophy of
the solution of "world riddles," we thought he had utterly gone mad.
For in this work we found the highest skill in the development and
polyphonic treatment of leading motives devoted to an attempt to make
music lecture on metaphysics, when all the time it was perfectly
obvious that without reading Nietzsche's book no one could have any
notion of the composer's intent. The mastery of orchestration and of
the technics of composition shown in this work convinced thoughtful
critics that Strauss was not to be sniffed out of consideration. Here
was a force to be reckoned with in musical progress, even though it
was mistakenly wielded.

With the introduction of "A Hero's Life," Strauss seemed suddenly
to have entered upon cleaner vision. To this day I am lost in wonder
at the vast and appalling ugliness of some parts of the composition,
but I know that custom will make dear to us musical idioms which now
excite our antipathy. That is an old story. Artusi of Bologna said
that Monteverde had lost sight of the true purpose of music,--to
give pleasure. A similar accusation was once brought against the
mellifluous and tactful Rossini. It was shouted through Europe
against Wagner. We may use it against Strauss, but if we do, we must
chance the ridicule of the hereafter. "A Hero's Life," despite its
frequent attempts to make music speak more definitely than music can,
is based on broad moods which are suitable for musical exposition.
Wild, chaotic, discordant as many of the passages of this remarkable
work certainly seem to us now, there is no denying the extraordinary
mastership shown in its thematic development. The Wagnerian method
of modifying themes in rhythm and harmony so as to alter their
dramatic significance is combined successfully with the methods of
the classicists in working out. Modern polyphony, the polyphony of
hazardous cross paths in acrid harmony, of the Impinging contrapuntal
curves, is handled with consummate ease. It is orchestral technic
of the highest kind, but it all aims at making music which shall
describe the minutest feelings, the finest shades of thought, and the
most varied actions of personages whom the hearer must see with his
mind's eye.

It aims at a wider and more detailed expression than the repulsive
"Don Juan" and the vulgar "Till Eulenspiegel," but it is clean and
wholesome in tone, and most of its material is safe from the charge
of unfitness for publication. It is not impossible to conceive of
Strauss after producing this work as looking back over his entire
orchestral product and addressing us in the words of the inscrutable
McIntosh Jellaludin: "Some of it must go; the public are fools
and prudish fools. I was their servant once. But do your mangling
gently--very gently. It is a great work, and I have paid for it in
seven years' damnation."

It is too soon for us to say that Strauss will influence the
future. He may leave us nothing but certain purely mechanical
improvements in orchestral technics. Even these will have their
value. Yet all recent attempts at progress in music have been in the
direction of more definite expression, and Strauss may be only a
stepping-stone in an advance toward that blissful epoch whose hearers
will display as much imagination as its composers, that transcendent
condition in which genius understands genius. As in that faculty-free
heaven celebrated in undergraduate song, no musical critics will be
there. Every man will be his own critic. The millennium will have
come.




                       II.--THE ÆSTHETIC VIEW

           Denique sit quidvis, simplex duntaxat et unum.

                                       HORACE, _Ars Poetica_.


Mr. Strauss has been acclaimed as an explorer, a pathfinder in the
wilderness of new art. But after all he is simply a product, or
perhaps it would be more exact to say a result; for the trend of
musical art in the past century was toward representation.

But the attempts of the early composers were in the line of
descriptive music, which is a species of mimetics. The transfer of
peculiar sounds and characteristic sound-motions, as in the cases of
whistling wind and undulating forest billows, to the musical canvas,
is a simple and natural process. It pleases the most superficial mind
by the translation of one art into terms of another. To "paint" in
sounds, as the musicians term it, is a pretty and poetic fancy. It is
like the poet's use of tone-speech to imitate qualities or motions.
It is the onomatopoetic in music. Sometimes it is the paronymous.

We are all cultivated savages. The primeval hordes of Europe had
their rude rhythms and their inarticulate cries, which were as
music to their ears. Significance was attached to these sounds
wholly because of their external resemblance to something lying in a
different plane of human experience. We have refined and extended the
scale and have attuned our ears and our spirits to higher tones. We
hear triads in stones, scales in running brooks, and chords of the
diminished seventh in everything.

How long was it before the musicians ceased to content themselves
with their tone pictures of ocean waves and murmuring streams?
Surely, it was not long after Monteverde found the rhythmic and
instrumental equivalents for the galloping of horses and the crashing
together of gallant and knightly combatants that the dream of joy or
woe, uttered in songs without words, entered the minds of composers.
Monteverde's lament of Arianna showed that the plaint of a sorrowing
heart might be most musical, most melancholy. Doubtless, as the
indolent Venetian gondolier hummed the melody and forgot the words
through the shining avenues of the island city, the thought came
dimly to him, as it did clearly to the musician, that the tune was
sad and saddening, even without the text.

But not till the time of Beethoven was a direct and explicit effort
made to paint soul pictures in wordless music. Beethoven was indeed
the regenerator of instrumental art, in that he demonstrated with
splendid and convincing power in his later symphonies that the
classic sonata form could sing the weal and woe of humanity with
eloquence as noble as that of the opera aria aided by the explanatory
comment of its own verses.

Beethoven, however, contented himself with broad outlines. He sang
passion, joy, grief, resolution, courage, force; but never did he
essay to impart to his music the virtue of an explanation. The fifth
symphony explains itself and it asks no aid from without. It does not
lean back against a wall of text for its support.

The seventh symphony has been subjected to various processes of
explanation, but it reads most clearly in its own light as a series
of mood pictures. The ninth symphony goes further, and here Beethoven
frankly confessed that in order to make his purpose clear he needed
text. The construction of the last movement brings to the hearer in
its opening measures a solution of the meaning of the three preceding
movements. It is the Wagnerian device of prophesying with themes in
the early part of a work, and furnishing the key when at length the
theme is associated with text later in the composition. There is no
utterly new thing under the _cantus firmus_.

Beethoven's psychographics are general and not specific. He does not
seek to chase the emotion to its source and to speculate upon its
nature and origin. He is content to represent it in tone, to decorate
it, if you will, with instrumental color, but there he stops. Shall
we say that therefore Beethoven's psychometry was saner and more
artistic than that of Strauss and his few brothers in art?

It is a question similar to that which arises in literature anent
the comparative merits of Shakespeare and Ibsen. But here is a
substantial difference. Shakespeare was unquestionably a mighty poet,
and Ibsen is a prose dramatist pure and simple. Shakespeare was an
idealist and Ibsen is the arch realist of the age. It is not just
criticism to compare these two. You may compare Clyde Fitch with
Sheridan or Augustus Thomas with Robertson, if you will, but it is
no more honest to compare Ibsen with Shakespeare than it would be to
compare him with Æschylus.

But when you come to music, you come to a different issue. Absolute
music is an entity. It is a very special branch of an art which has
varieties. The lied, for example, is an art form by itself; so is
the oratorio, and so again is the music drama of Wagner. It were
foolish to try to compare the symphonies of Beethoven with the songs
of Schubert and thence to decide which was the greater composer.
The development of the symphonic branch of musical art is that in
which Beethoven was most specially concerned, and it is to his
successors in that field that we must look to study the outcome of
his innovations.

When we trace the advance of symphonic art from Beethoven to
Strauss, we find a steady and irresistible movement away from the
representation of broad, fundamental soul states, from a strictly
scientific method of musical psychostatics down to a condition in
which the orchestra is transformed into a psychoscope, and the
symphony is become a treatise on mental diseases and methods of
conversing with the dead. Composers seem bent on pinning down to
their artistic dissecting-tables the very essence of the soul itself.

The simple imitative method of the pristine descriptions in tone
has become neurotic mimicry, and the melodic and harmonic idioms
hint that the modern ear is suffering from acute myringomycrosis, a
cheerful affliction caused by the growth of fungi on the ear drum.
Fungi are plentiful in damp and noisome places, and these seem to be
the artistic haunts of the imaginations of the Ibscene realists in
music.

This so-called "romantic" music of to-day owes a considerable debt
to the Abbé Liszt, whose undertakings in the domain of art are
overestimated by his adulators and undervalued by his detractors.
But there is no practical denial of the fact that Liszt fashioned a
system and set up a manner in his symphonic poem. Richard Strauss
might have been possible without Liszt, but as matters stand we are
bound to acknowledge the debt of the composer of "Don Juan" to the
composer of "Tasso."

Yet how far beyond Liszt has the psychologic composition of to-day
advanced? Liszt did undertake to make his music tell stories, and
that is a thing which, with all deference to Liszt, music cannot do
and never has done. You have to read Byron's "Mazeppa" to understand
Liszt's, just as you have to read Bürger's "Lenore" if you wish to
understand so naïve a story-teller as Raff's "Lenore" symphony. How
much more necessary is it to read Maeterlinck's "Death of Tintagiles"
in order to understand Charles Martin Loeffler? Not a bit.

But Liszt never dreamed of analyzing soul states and those
mysterious conflicts of soul and body which form the materials of
psychomachy. He never sought to trace the origin of life nor the
seat of the vital spark. The abbé was something of a mystic, too,
but he knew he was not a genius. A very able dissimulator, a pious
Mephistopheles, a Machiavellian master of musical arts, and the
father of Cosima Wagner, he exploited his external impositions with
consummate skill; and when he sat down to compose, he swore fealty to
the highest ideals with all the sincerity of Iago swearing vengeance
at the side of the kneeling Othello.

He sent forth into the easy world his purple and yellow masterpieces,
and the world called them royal. A little drawing and a great deal
of color was what he offered, and the public saw in his splotches of
sound Turneresque mystery and mastery. The dear public still loves
these works, and will probably continue to do so for many years.
And in one respect the public is right. Liszt never tried to be
too definite. He left something to the imagination, and when the
public has not any imagination, it imagines that it has, and that
it is discerning things in Liszt's works which Liszt himself never
discovered.

Camille Saint-Saëns of France is, in his boulevardian way, a
follower of Liszt. He also has written symphonic poems and he has
been wise enough not to go to the uttermost limits of detailed
expression. His Hercules is a gentleman and his Omphale dwelt not far
from the Rue de Berlin. Hercules went to see her in a Paris cab--you
can hear the cocher swear. Omphale dressed him in a Paquin gown and
dealt him exquisite love-taps with his rosewood opera cane.

Dainty Hercules of the Boulevard des Italiens and seductive Omphale
of the Rue de Berlin! Ye are the Watteau pictures of a would-be
pastoral, the mincing marionettes of a cigarette smoker's dream.
Between such gentle figures as you and the chortling barbarians of
the Strauss phantasy there is the vast and impassable gulf of fetid
inspiration which separates Alexander Pope from Rabelais. Though
he paint Phaeton swinging wide the chariot of the sun through the
affrighted heavens and plunging headlong into Eridanus, or Death
strumming the "zig et zig et zag sur son violon," Saint-Saëns is
always a gentleman, the Mendelssohn of romantic orchestration.

But the symphonic poem is not confined to Liszt and Saint-Saëns. It
has spread itself through all Europe and has inoculated the symphony.
Poor Rubinstein! When he wrote his "Ocean" symphony, he held himself
within the limits of the art of composition as formulated by
Beethoven in his fifth and seventh symphonies. He painted broad mood
pictures. He imitated motions as frankly as Haydn. He was elementary,
even at times elemental. At any rate, he was sane. He respected
the boundaries that lie, as Ambros has shown us, between music and
poetry, and did not call upon the tone art to write treatises and
handbooks. He strove to induce music to sing the might and majesty of
the ocean, but he did not ask it to find the latitude and longitude.

Other masters have struggled to make the symphony more definite in
its tale-telling, but till to-day it has succeeded in keeping its
place as the epitome of general emotional states. Tschaïkowsky--most
vigorous, if not most subtle, of all recent masters, bursting with
savage passions, flaming with wild northern fancies--wrote into the
symphony the representation of all human sufferings, the yearnings
and grim revel, the madness and despair of Russia. But he clung to
the deep-laid emotional scheme.

In his overtures he has gone not a whit further than Beethoven did
in the "Leonore" No. 3. Tschaïkowsky's "Hamlet," his "Romeo and
Juliet," are mood pictures, perfectly comprehensible to all who know
the dramas. They class with such works as Goldmark's "Sakuntala" and
"Prometheus." Of these latter how clear and convincing is the second
with its voices of sea nymphs, its solitude of the ocean, its mad
effort of the man, and its lightning blast of Jove.

True, you must know Æschylus, and therein lies the weakness of all
this kind of music, its temptation and its danger. If we may go so
far, how are we to be estopped from prying further into the mysteries
of musical depiction?

How this field has tempted the Frenchmen, and how little they have
found in it! After all, Saint-Saëns is not so bad. Think of the
intricate platitudes, the prolix prosiness and lofty emptiness of
Bruneau's "Penthesilée" and "La Belle aux Bois Dormant" (poèmes
symphoniques au sérieux, mes amis), while Godard, Joncières,
Paladilhe, and others have dipped respectfully into the romantic
_potage_ and barely soiled their fingers. But all have striven to
paint in tones, and have at any rate gone as far as sketching in
detail.

Possibly the time will come when music will be a universal language.
Certain cadences will be accepted in China, in Sussex, or in New
Jersey, as signifying such and such emotions or ideas, and certain
resolutions of suspensions will have a meaning current in St.
Petersburg, Vienna, and Cincinnati. But that time has not yet come,
and the programme note is still an essential accessory either before
or after the offence of the intimate symphonic poem.

The composers, while acknowledging this, continue to go forward
along the path which they have chosen. Music is daily moving away
from the broad mood pictures of Beethoven toward some form in which
every phrase shall have its part and place in the exposition of soul
secrets. The Frenchmen have made but little success, as we have seen,
for they have treated their composition, not as literary music, but
as literature itself.

If the work of Richard Strauss has any permanent significance at
all, it is that the æsthetic basis of the Liszt and Tschaïkowsky
compositions, the Goldmark overtures and the polished tone poems
of the Frenchmen is false, and that every attempt to rear upon it
a lasting art form must be futile. Here need be no discussion of
the stupendous achievements of Strauss's orchestration, nor the
astounding hideousness of his harmonic plan.

Who was it said recently that the good Mr. Loeffler of Boston
thought music in a scale of his own? The Loeffler scale--C, D, E,
F sharp, G sharp, A sharp, C. How sharper than a serpent's tooth!
Strauss thinks in a harmony of his own. A harmony? A cacophony. The
clash of jarring discord is as honey on the palate of his ear. The
tonic triad is not a stranger to him, but its devilish consonance of
the major third is to his mind, as it was to the pious fancies of the
mediæval fathers, the spirit of tonal evil, the seductive embodiment
of sensual sweetness.

Listen to his eternal feminine. When she plays the virtuous Kundry
to his Hero of the "Heldenleben" or the Venus to his nomadic
"Eulenspiegel" Tannhäuser, she sings in the wickedly purring major
mode. But when heroic virtue slaughters ink-stained critics or scales
the battlements of jarring worlds and plants the standard of manhood
on a minaret of the universe, then titanic visions are expressed
in crashing collisions of minor seconds or in strangled sixths
and desiccated elevenths. Trumpets bleat through their noses, and
clarinets chuckle in staccato treble; trombones rattle in raucous
gurgles, and bassoons snort in hoarse expirations.

But all this is superficial. This is the manner, not the matter
of the Strauss music. How far can this master magician, this royal
juggler with resolutions and suspensions, this acrobat of the flying
chord, go with his endeavor to make music say for him the things
that the entire decadent literature of modern Europe has striven to
put down in plain words? If Strauss means anything, he means that
Beethoven and Schumann were but the avant couriers of a vast march
of progress into the bowels of delineation, the vitals of psychic
communication.

Liszt and Tschaïkowsky and Goldmark postulated a false theory of
orchestral art because they clearly defined limitations. They
promulgated by their practice the doctrine that only the broader
moods of story could be represented in music. Strauss preaches that
when Beethoven depicted in his fifth symphony the struggle of a soul
and for the finer illustration of his thought united the scherzo with
the finale, he opened the gateway to indefinite progress, and swung
wide a banner with the old device, "Facilis descensus Averno."

Suppose, however, that this paragraph in the artistic treatise of
Strauss contains a germinal truth, does it of necessity follow that
to advance along the opened path is to finish in the corruption and
rank odor of the morgue? What has so got the start of the majestic
art of music as to lead it to the grave? First of all, decadent
poetry and fiction. When music began to strive to make itself a
representative art, it confronted itself with a choice of objects.
Primarily it had human life and experience as found in the composer's
own soul, and this was the noblest source of all. "Look into thine
own heart and write," is excellent advice for a composer. Then it had
literature, the conservation of the experience and observation of
man from the literary point of view. With these two sources it had
to rest content, for neither sculpture nor painting offered anything
other than the composition of life translated into other terms. The
musician would better paint the Laocoön from his own conception than
from the conception of the sculptor. He would but make music and
water of Raphael's Madonna if he studied her instead of the Mary of
the Holy Writ.

How long did it take the musician to discover that the Virgin was
not such inspiring musical material as Mary Magdalen? Just as long
as it took him to learn that he could not make a great composition
out of a steady flow of sweetness, that he must have a warring of
elements in his work, and that there must be some melodic principle
striving for victory and at the end emerging from temporary tonal
chaos in a pæan of triumph. The temptation of St. Anthony was better
matter for the composer than the meditations of St. Augustine, and
the fast of Christ in the wilderness was less alluring than the
legend of Herodias and John the Baptist.

In other words, the modern musician has found his finest inspirations
in that struggle of good with evil in the human soul which has
inspired the works of the greatest modern dramatists. The only
question that remained to be solved after this was, How far would the
musician go? The dramatist and the poet ran morbid; the musician,
seeking his inspiration in the records of human souls made in the
terms of literature, followed the man of the pen into the slough of
despond.

The morbid studies of such dramatists as Ibsen and Maeterlinck are
the real key to the music of such a composer as Strauss. Yet let
us not deny that the musician is less drastic in his methods than
the literary men. Strauss has indeed written his "Don Juan" and his
"Death and Apotheosis," but he has placed upon their pages some
passages of marvellous beauty. It is a beauty of orchestral idiom,
of instrumental development, rather than of melodic exfoliation.
Strauss, when all is said and done, is not master of melodic
invention, but he speaks a language which is all his own, and he
rises at times to a power of sonorous utterance which has not been
equalled in these modern days except by Wagner.

In his "Heldenleben" he has written more clearly than in some of
his earlier works, but when all is said, his chief concern seems to
be the dissection of souls for the purpose of exposing the lurking
spot of disease. He gives us psychonosology--the study of mental
diseases--rather than psychostatics--the study of the permanent
conditions of the soul--which Beethoven gave us.

Whether this be right or wrong, true or false art, is not for the
present to decide. Certainly such music is not for the masses. It
is not for those who persist in listening to tunes as tunes only
and condemning as no music that music which aims at some sort of
representation.

To condemn such music is to throw over the later works of Beethoven,
the choicest products of Chopin and Schumann, and many another
creation with which even the mere tune-lover would be loath to
part. But when the broad principles of all art are applied to the
soul searchings of Richard Strauss, questionings will arise. Is
it art? Certainly not, by the law of Schopenhauer, which guided
Wagner,--eternal ideas represented by means of prototypes.

This will hardly apply to Strauss's "Don Juan" or his "Till
Eulenspiegel." Beauty has thus far been the acknowledged end of all
art. Are these things beautiful? Is their æsthetic basis lofty and
wholesome? Surely not. Yet old Horace was indisputably right. Life is
short, and art is long. How many viewless ages yet shall run before
the process be complete? Who are we, to make final conclusions and
splutter our puny "Quod erat demonstrandum"? Let us wait.

For the fleeting present we must hang pendulous between two positive
extremes. Strauss is a symphonic poet or a symphonic poetaster. He is
a dreamer of grandly grotesque visions, a Cervantes, a Rabelais, if
you will, or a mere opium-eater without the genius of a De Quincey.
Something of the mystic phantasy of De Quincey certainly lurks in
the brain of him who wrote "Tod und Verklärung," and out of the
contrapuntal abyss of "Zarathustra" emerges at the last something
like the stupendous finale of the "Dream-Fugue":--

    "Then was completed the passion of the mighty fugue. The
    golden tubes of the organ, which had as yet but muttered
    at intervals,--gleaming among clouds and surges of
    incense,--threw up, as from fountains unfathomable, columns
    of heart-shattering music. Choir and anti-choir were filling
    fast with unknown voices. Thou also, dying trumpeter, with
    thy love that was victorious and thy anguish that was finishing,
    didst enter the tumult; trumpet and echo--farewell love and
    farewell anguish--rang through the dreadful sanctus."

Or is it all, this music of Strauss, a monstrous joke, and does
the man laugh in his sleeve at the troubled world? Is he not only
a musical Rabelais, but also that malodorous jest of a Rabelaisian
brain, Gargantua himself?

    "One of his governesses told me that at the very sound of
    pints and flagons he would fall into an ecstasy, as if he
    were tasting the joys of Paradise; and upon consideration
    of this his divine complexion they would every morning, to
    cheer him, play with a knife upon the glasses, or the bottles
    with their stoppers, and on the pint pots with their lids;
    at the sound whereof he became gay, would leap for joy,
    and rock himself in the cradle, lolling with his head and
    monochordizing with his fingers."

Till Eulenspiegel, Gargantua of Germany, noisome, nasty, rollicking
Till, with the whirligig scale of a yellow clarinet in his brain
and the beer-house rhythm of a pint pot in his heart, a joke upon a
joke,--was he, and not the posing _Held_ of the "Heldenleben," the
real Strauss?




                    III.--WHAT DOES IT ALL MEAN?

            We transfretate the Sequane at the dilucul and crepuscul;
            we deambulate by the compites and quadrives of the urb; we
            despumate the Latin verbocination; and like verysimilary
            amorabons, we captat the benevolence of the omnijugal,
            omniform and omnigenal feminine sex.

                             RABELAIS, _Pantagruel_, bk. ii. ch. vi.


It matters little from what point we view the tendency of
musical art as it is disclosed to our vision through its most
potent manifestations. We are driven inward upon the central and
all-important question, How far can music go in the direction of
depicting things which lie outside itself? Is it to convert itself
into a language, or shall it sink into a kind of rapt mysticism
which shall be accepted in a vague way as a species of philosophic
speculation?

Walter Pater in his essay on Coleridge says: "The true illustration
of the speculative temper is not the Hindoo mystic, lost to sense,
understanding, individuality, but one such as Goethe, to whom every
moment of life brought its contribution of experimental individual
knowledge; by whom no touch of the world of form, color, and passion
was disregarded."

Herein lies a deep, pregnant suggestion. Pater knew little enough
of the inner nature of music, but he was able to make some sensible
deductions from his comprehension of art in the broader sense, and in
another place in the volume just quoted ("Appreciations") he suggests
the possibility that music might be the ideal of all art, "precisely
because in music it is impossible to distinguish the form from the
substance or matter, the subject from the expression."

Against such a summary of the nature of music the whole practice of
composition to-day cries out. And at the same time it finds itself
unsatisfied by such a standard of speculative thought as that set
up by Mr. Pater. Music would perhaps profit highly by a faithful
adherence to that law of continual regard to the suggestions of the
"world of form, color, and passion." But the rapt vacancy of the
Hindoo mystic woos and wins the favor of composers, for outwardly it
has a philosophic appearance, and to philosophize in music seems now
to be the highest desire of its masters.

It is useless to attempt to blind one's self to facts. The march
of music from pure beauty of form and development of melodic ideas
toward the representation of ideas not musical in themselves has
been going on, as we have seen, from the very beginning. But at the
outset there was no endeavor to translate mental processes into
musical terms. As far back as the middle of the fifteenth century the
story of Susanna was told in unaccompanied choral music of purely
contrapuntal pattern. But there was no subtlety in such music.
The text set forth the narrative; the music was a mere framework.
Jannequin wrote his "Cries of Paris" in a similar style, but his
musical effects consisted of a few primitive imitations of externals.

Kuhnau's descriptive sonatas contain nothing confusing. They are
cheerfully frank in their endeavor to paint externals. They do not
probe either heart or brain. Not till the association of music with
the drama in the opera of the Italians of 1600, do we find the tone
art deliberately set to work to embody the inner life of man, and
then feelings alone were set forth.

The effort to embody feelings in vocal music was intelligible and
natural. Song borrowed its inflections from speech, and speech
took them from inarticulate cries. Peri's notion of using a smooth
movement and a narrow range of intervals for unimpassioned song was
taken from the instinctive practice of speech. We speak in two or
three notes, and slowly and regularly when we are perfectly calm.
When we become excited, our voices move through more intervals and
the tempo is accelerated. In agitation the speech is in broken,
spasmodic phrases; the voice rises and falls irregularly. In sadness
the minor mode comes involuntarily into our tones, and in weeping we
slide portamento through the chromatic scale.

When Gluck revived the method of Peri and worked it out elaborately,
he struck the deathblow to classicism, but his conservation of the
musical principle is to be found in his continued employment of
the purely musical forms. It was not for Gluck, a sculpturesque
composer, a worshipper of melodic line and curve, to enter into the
new paradise of operatic tone-speech. He pruned the old tree of many
useless limbs; he swept from it a mass of noisome fungi; but he
sat peacefully under its shade and knew not that its trunk pointed
slantwise away from the zenith.

Gluck faced the parting of the ways, but saw it not. With the young,
ingenuous, unsophisticated, and absolutely musical symphony of
Haydn staring him in the eyes, he failed to discover that its basic
principles were not available for the construction of an art form
embodying his dramatic ideals. The cyclic form of the plain song was
predominant in the thought of Gluck, and it misled him from his own
chosen path.

Weber failed to become a writer of speculative music for the same
reason. He utilized the Volkslied form in his operas, and thus kept
music in her throne of rule over text. Yet the effort of these two
men toward an intelligible expression of feeling in music was bound
to affect the composers of purely instrumental works.

There is no question in any mind that music can express feeling, or,
at any rate, arouse it. From the earliest time there has been music
for the feast and music for the funeral. Joy and sorrow have spoken
their hearts in the accents of song. Practice in the employment of
the elements of musical expression was bound to make the utterance
clearer, and when the rule of the ecclesiastic scales had been broken
and the modern major and minor modes had come into their own, it was
but another step to the complete inheritance of the chromatic world
which Cyprian di Rore strove to open up as far back as 1544.

It was when Wagner threw over the entire apparatus of the cyclic
form and the _lied_ and utilized to the utmost the resources of
chromatic modulation, that music in the drama entered completely into
the office of emotional expression. A new form was developed: that in
which a set of melodic fragments, each with a definite significance,
was woven into an instrumental ocean upon which the voice-parts
floated like enchanted shallops. Wagner fairly fulfilled the Pater
conception of the truly speculative artist, one "by whom no touch of
the world of form, color, and passion was disregarded." Gluck treated
poetry as a jewel, for which he as an artist was to provide the most
chaste, beautiful, and appropriate setting. Wagner viewed poetry and
music as two precious metals which he was to melt in the crucible of
his genius into a new and more glorious product.

We stand to-day, in so far as opera is concerned, upon the ground
cleared for us by Wagner. The Italians are striving to follow
his lead, though they are instinctively and almost ineffectively
endeavoring to preserve in their works that outward shape of vocal
melody which is a clearly drawn national characteristic. Since
Verdi's "Falstaff" nothing has been written which is of high import,
for the calm contemplation of criticism cannot be deceived by the
superficial cleverness of "Tosca," "La Bohème," and "Pagliacci," or
the Mascagni turgidities. These works sparkle with the jewels of
talent, but they never glow with the sunlight of genius. One act of
Verdi's "Otello" or Boito's "Mefistofele" pales their reflected fires
to the sickly yellow of a farthing rushlight.

But these writers are striving to advance beyond Wagner in the
subtlety of the inner processes which they put into music. In all
the Wagnerian drama there is no such purely modern product as the
Scarpia of Puccini or the Osaka of Mascagni. Loge is elemental. He is
a superhuman poetic creation, as well suited to the investiture of
music as Milton's Lucifer. But setting Scarpia and Osaka to music is
much like composing Joseph Chamberlain or Thomas Collier Platt.

The reaction of all this refinement of the means of expression in
the musical drama upon instrumental music has led the song without
words into a new country. The primitive descriptions of Kuhnau
and Bach now make us smile. We have hunted the central secret to
its lair. We have asked music to sing not only those broad moods
of joy and sadness, peace and rage, which the imitation of the
inflections of the voice in speech made possible for her in the very
infancy of inarticulate song, but we have demanded that she chase
the intellectual concept to its source and embody reasonings and
conclusions as if she were the handmaid of the inductive method.

So far have we gone that we can no longer blame those primitive
thinkers who seek to fasten a story upon every composition. We find
even so calm a commentator as Sir George Grove regretting that
Beethoven did not prefix a descriptive title to the fifth symphony in
order that we might discover his expressional purpose.

We have reached a situation which reduces music to a secondary
position. She is no longer a proud and independent art, in which,
as Mr. Pater notes, the substance and the form are one. The classic
forms in which purely musical beauty was contained, in which the
attempts at expression were confined to broad mood painting and
the methods were always those of thematic development, are used by
comparatively few composers. The title "symphony" is placed upon
works which have few of the characteristics of the Beethoven model.

True, these works do not, because they cannot, abandon the
fundamental principles of musical form. Even the tone poems of
Richard Strauss are built in accordance with these inexorable
laws. Architecture cannot do away with walls and roofs and floors,
nor the consideration of weight-sustaining power. But its outward
presentations may and do travel far away from the manner of the
Greeks.

Music no longer exists for herself. She seeks material always from
without. Who writes now an "overture, scherzo, and finale"? Even
Schumann, one of the pioneers of the modern romantic movement, did
that; but our overfed imaginations require stimulation in the shape
of titles. It must be an overture to an East Indian poem, which none
of us ever read, or a symphonic fantasia on a Buddhistic doctrine,
or a theme and variations setting forth the thoughts and actions
of an allegorical character who was in himself a satire upon a
generalization. In order that we may know what the composer is trying
to tell us in the inarticulate language of the song without words,
we must have a long and perplexing explanation by a learned pundit
who constructs programme notes with the aid of a public library and a
few Delphic hints from the composer himself. Then we must sit in the
concert room gravely contemplating these notes while the orchestra is
playing the music, and seriously endeavoring to delude ourselves into
the belief that we can perform two mental processes at once,--namely,
reading and grasping the fulness of the programme explanation at the
same time that we listen to and analyze the composition.

It seems about time for us to return to our Ambros and study his
admirable book on the "Boundaries of Music and Poetry." Here is his
just and convincing conclusion: "But in its ideal feature, music
keeps within its natural boundaries so long as it does not undertake
to go beyond its expressional capacity,--that is, so long as the
poetical thought of the composer becomes intelligible from the moods
called forth by his work and the train of ideas stimulated thereby,
that is, from the composition itself; and so long as nothing foreign,
not organically connected with the music itself, must be dragged in
in order to assist comprehension."

How many of our ultra-refined orchestral studies in logic will stand
examination in the searching light of that proclamation? Yet Ambros
comes to that conclusion at the end of a volume written in answer
to Hanslick's "The Beautiful in Music," of which the fundamental
doctrine is that music has not expressional power at all. Ambros set
out to show that it had, but that there was a point beyond which it
could not go.

That point he found set clearly in view in the symphonic works of
Berlioz. He recounts the process of development of that master's
"Romeo et Juliette" symphony. He compares it with Mendelssohn's
"Meerestille und Glückliche Fahrt" overture, and notes that the title
of the latter is an exact reproduction of Goethe's language. But
"there is in the matter the great difference that this tonal work,
even utterly apart from Goethe's poem, is in and through itself
explicable and intelligible, and bears in itself its æsthetic centre
of gravity and the conditions of its existence, whereas in the
case of 'Romeo and Juliet' the centre of gravity lies outside, the
music,--that is to say, in the Shakespearian drama."

Mendelssohn, when he conceived his "Fingal's Cave" overture,
embodied in a sentence the impeccable theory of correctly conceived
programme music. He wrote to his sister that he could not describe
such a thing, but he could play it. Having absorbed the mood of
that landscape, he, being a musician, could reproduce it only in
tones. Berlioz, on the other hand, sought not only to picture in his
music the personalities and passions of the lovers, but he sought
to reproduce in the form of a scherzo the poetic description of an
imaginary conception, Queen Mab, put into the mouth of a character
created by Shakespeare! It was a long way round, was it not?

How great a difference is there between that process and Mr.
Strauss's attempt to convey to us in music the conversation of
Don Quixote and Sancho Panza or the anger of the knight at seeing
the false Dulcinea? The centre of gravity is outside the music.
So it is in "Ein Heldenleben," Strauss's strongest composition,
and in his other tone poems. Tschaïkowsky, on the other hand, was
content to write "Pathetique"--even more than was needed--over his
sixth symphony, and let it stand with that. His "Romeo and Juliet"
overture fantasia is dependent upon itself alone for its artistic
justification. The centre of æsthetic gravity is in the work.

Let us, however, give Mr. Strauss the benefit of his own utterances.
In 1897, in speaking of "Also sprach Zarathustra" he said: "I did
not intend to write philosophical music, nor to portray Nietzsche's
great work musically. I meant to convey musically an idea of the
development of the human race from its origin through the various
phases of development (religious as well as scientific) up to
Nietzsche's idea of the Uebermensch, the Beyond-Man of Goethe."

As a London critic remarked at the time, "even this is a tall
order." Of course Mr. Strauss's word must be accepted. But before
the present writer lies an elaborate pamphlet of some forty pages
by Frederick Roesch and Eberhard Koenig, entitled "Ein Heldenleben,
Tondichtung für Grosses Orchester, von Richard Strauss." It
reproduces sixty-eight themes from the tone poem and has a long and
laborious explanation of the composer's purpose and meaning. There
are similar programme notes for other works by this composer. Persons
who admit the iniquity of such explanations stoutly maintain that Mr.
Strauss does not approve of them. The one before us was published
by F. E. C. Leuckart, of Leipsic. On the last page are advertised
several compositions by Strauss published by the same person.

Furthermore, previous to the production of the "Symphonia Domestica"
in New York last March, Mr. Strauss had steadfastly denied that
there was any programme for the work. "It represents simply a day
in my family life," he said. These statements were repeated in the
official programme note of the concert, written by my colleague, H.
E. Krehbiel, of the New York _Tribune_. The day after the concert
the New York _Times_ published a detailed programme of the symphony,
furnished to the writer, Richard Aldrich, by Dr. Strauss, and that
programme was more elaborate and materialistic than any imagined by
uninformed gropers after the composer's meaning.

Howsoever these things be, the ultimate question remains: Will the
compositions of Mr. Strauss and his kind stand the test of Ambros?
Is their æsthetic centre of gravity within themselves? That is a
true test of all art works. The test of a Corot landscape is not
its perfect portraiture of a place, but its complete and satisfying
existence as a painting; and that, be it noted, is wholly a matter of
artistic feeling in the work itself. The test of a poem is not its
power to convey to the reader a mental photograph of the scene or
action or thought which inspired the work, but to touch the reader's
emotions, to stimulate his imagination by and through itself alone.
Neither the observer of the landscape nor the reader of the poem is
asked to look outside of the work itself for an explanation of its
mood. The picture and the poem fully explain themselves. They lay
before the mind both cause and effect.

This music cannot do. Long ago it was called the language of
emotion, and the embodiment of feeling is its highest province. Even
in the opera, with the assistance of text and action, music should
not strive to go further than this. Its office is to voice the
emotions which lie behind action and speech, to raise to the tenth
power those simpler and more limited inflections and tones of the
voice which are used in the spoken drama. In the great instrumental
song without words it is again moods and emotions that music must
proclaim. Mr. Strauss may tell us that in "Also sprach Zarathustra"
he did not attempt to do the things which makers of programme
explanations accused him of doing, but merely to put before us, in
music, the simple process of the religious and scientific development
of the human race up to the conception of the Beyond-Man.

How easy it all is, to be sure, and how stupidly devoid of
imagination we must all be who fail to read it clearly in the music!
If we fail to find it, it is our fault. Lichtenberg, a witty German,
said, "If a monkey look into a mirror, no Apostle will look out."

We may save ourselves much time and intellectual labor if we listen
carefully to "Also sprach Zarathustra." Dr. Draper packed a history
of the intellectual development of Europe into two substantial
volumes which a thoughtful man may read in a winter; yet he may hear
not only the intellectual, but also the religious development of the
entire human race in Mr. Strauss's tone poem in about thirty minutes.
A benefactor of mankind indeed is this philanthropist, who has not
sought to write philosophical music. He has invented for us a kind of
sugar-coated knowledge tablet. Abolish dry books and listen to the
tone poems of Richard Strauss, and you will have the wisdom of the
ages poured into your ears by trumpets and trombones.

And yet how refreshing to the spirit it is to hear after a Strauss
tone preachment some such work of pure feeling as Schumann's Spring
symphony! Here is no fugued fuddle of the fulminations of science.
Here is no heart-wrung cry of a philosopher from the mountain top,
come down to set whole the disjointed times and wailing because the
populace thinks him a goatherd. Here is no dissector of sated souls,
no juggler with death rattles, no miser of a hope-drained race.

Here is one who served and suffered for the sake of love's infinite
joy, who has trod the valley of the shadow and come to the sunlit
plateau of his heart's desire, and who, as he lifts his brow to the
radiance of the new day, strikes his lyre and bursts into a pæan of
rapture. His music glows and throbs with feeling, for it is feeling
grown too great for the inflection of common speech and so hymned
to us by the myriad-voiced orchestra in one beautiful anthem of the
budding of eternal spring in the heart of a man. That is programme
music which needs no explanatory notes.

  "Backward, turn backward, O Time, in thy flight!
  Make me a child again just for to-night."

How often shall we who are treading the downward slopes of life
croon that old couplet and yearn for the cradle songs of Schubert
and Beethoven? How often, too, we wonder, will a weary world turn
back with weary brain from the sordid task of transfretating "the
Sequane at the dilucul and crepuscul" with Strauss and his tribe to
the poets of the dawn who smote the great primeval chords of human
feeling? This we may not now answer, for orchestral music is yet in
her infancy and it is possible that the period of to-day is but the
disturbance of a transition.




                  IV.--STRAUSS AND THE SONG WRITERS

            He hath songs, for man or woman, of all sizes.

                             _A Winter's Tale_, Act IV. Sc. 3.


In the domain of the song new developments have come forward with
startling rapidity in recent years. Every student of musical history
is familiar with the growth of what is called the art song. The folk
song was a simple form, in which a good, round tune, once made,
served for every stanza. The early composers of songs were content to
adhere to this form, which had its musical claim for supremacy, just
as the Italian opera had.

But after a time the imperious demand of text for appropriate
embodiment compelled a departure from the old manner. Mozart set
a pretty fashion when he composed "Das Veilchen" and altered
the germinal thematic idea, by a process similar to symphonic
development, to meet the varying sentiment of the verse. But not much
was accomplished till the birth of the so-called romantic movement.
This was really nothing more than the victory of a principle, which
had for centuries been striving for dominion, and it led the world
to enthusiastic adoration of the songs of Schubert and the operas of
Weber.

Then began the reign of what the Germans call the "durchcomponirtes
lied," literally the "through-composed song." This is the song in
which the music faithfully follows the text and changes in melodic
externals and in harmonic plan to express sentiment. Schubert's
"Erl-König" is a perfect specimen of this kind of song. Of course the
writing of songs in the old strophical form did not cease. Why should
it? There were still plenty of texts which lent themselves readily to
that kind of setting, and if popularity be sought, there is nothing
like a fixed melodic idea.

Gradually, however, those composers who seek always to dwell in
a rarefied atmosphere, who are nothing if not "utter," and who
ceaselessly endeavor to make poor Music a mere handmaid of all the
other arts, have driven the "durchcomponirtes lied" to the verge
of incoherence. The musical idea has become almost intangible, and
all that seems to be left is a vague dispensation of tonalities and
recitativo. For some sanity in this method of writing we have to
thank the arch speculator of Munich, Richard Strauss. Whatever may
be the ultimate outcome of the dispute over his orchestral riddles,
there need be no hesitation in pronouncing him a master of the modern
manner of song writing.

Mr. Strauss's songs belong of a surety to the domain of the
ultra-romantic. There is little of the old-fashioned German lied
in them. It might be possible to trace their descent from the
folksong of Germany, and occasionally one appears in the genuine
"volksthümlisches lied"[1] style. But many generations of artistic
development separate these songs from their progenitors. The strophic
form has quite disappeared in most of them. They are in the widest
sense composed through. The germinal thematic idea is but a root from
which the song grows. It barely sets a style and a direction for the
whole. But it must not be supposed that these songs are in any sense
formless.

[1] The volksthümlisches lied is a variety of song written by
artistic composers on a plan suggested by the folk song. It is the
folk song placed under cultivation.

They have an individual symmetry of form. It is a variety of the
form of the romantic school, which is built entirely upon the
emotional plan underlying the music. The musical scheme, therefore,
consists of a proposition which is worked out by a method of
transition, so that new material springs from the original thematic
germ, and we arrive at novel and striking conclusions.

Of melodic shape in the old sense some of these songs have almost
nothing. But they are none the less luxuriously melodious. Their
melodic nature differs from that of a Schubert song as the melodic
nature of a Wagner drama does from that of a Weber opera. This does
not mean that they are better songs than Schubert's. There are no
other songs as fine as those of the fecund Franz Peter. But music is
making progress, and the methods of song writing will probably change
as fast as those of operatic and orchestral composition. Art is ever
disinclined to stand still.

The harmonic basis of the Strauss songs is the principal cause of
their melodic luxuriance. Strauss harmonizes wholly for what the
Germans call the "stimmung." We have no word which exactly reproduces
the meaning of this one; but let us call it the voicing of the
mood. Strauss's harmony is designed to make an atmosphere in which
his melody floats. At the same time this atmosphere is to envelop
the hearer and saturate him with the feeling of the song. The high
organism of this plan of attack upon the listener stamps it as the
refined product of modern, thoroughly sophisticated art.

It is very trying on the singer. Some of Dr. Strauss's voice-parts,
planned, not as the ultimate object in view, but wholly as a part of
a general scheme, are cruelly difficult. In range alone they make
searching demands upon the vocal resources. In the department of
mental conception of tone--the highest field of vocal technic--they
are as evasive as some of the tonal illusions of Wagner. But they
are not unsingable. On the contrary, once let the singer thoroughly
permeate himself with the harmonic atmosphere, and thus attune
himself to the "stimmung" of the song, and his troubles reduce
themselves to the common problems of production and coloring of tone,
which have nothing more to do with the nature of Dr. Strauss's songs
than with those of all other artistic composers.

It is essential to the success of songs of this kind that the
declamation be arranged with much skill, otherwise that pregnant
significance which is to come of a perfect marriage of sound and
sense will be missing. In this department of his technical labor Dr.
Strauss shows much ingenuity in most of his songs. Sometimes the
text is dramatized in a manner quite masterly. In the entire range
of song literature one would search far to find anything more subtle
or potent than the opening of "Hoffen und wieder verzagen." This is
a piece of dramatic declamation written in the modern recitative
idiom and as distant as possible from the pure lied style; but it is
intensely dramatic.

Accompaniments this composer writes with skill. They are sufficiently
independent without at any time dominating the song, while in their
employment of details they assist greatly in creating the mood. The
result of the combination of the best traits found in these songs
is a striking power of exposition, a convincing formation of the
"stimmung." When upon a well-established mood Strauss builds climaxes
such as those of "Wie solten wir geheim sie halten," "Heimliche
Aufforderung," and "Caecile," the effect is moving. When he desires
to offer a touch of that humor which lies close to tears, he can do
it, as witness that little masterpiece "Ach weh mir unglückhaftem
Mann."

Yet with all the beauties of the Strauss songs there are some
weaknesses that must not be denied. A cycle of these songs will
not maintain its charm from beginning to end as will Schumann's
"Dichterliebe," or Schubert's "Müllerlider." The earlier song
masters, to be, sure, had the advantage of a more fertile soil. They
had fresh fields and pastures new. And they belonged to a school of
composers whose very first claim to distinction was their fecundity
of melodic invention.

The Strauss songs are not primarily melodic. Neither are any of
the high art songs of our time. All our song masters are marching
steadily out into the vague and mystic land of moonlight moods and
shifting shadows of tonalities. The strict song form irks them. They
cease not to twist their phrases so that these may not coincide
with the lines of the stanza. They are stung with the virus of the
Wagnerian method. They make melody in fragments.

Now it is no easy matter to write one vague, semi-mystic, intangibly
harmonized mood picture after another, eschewing clearly marked
melodic and rhythmic outlines, and at the same time to avoid
monotony. Dr. Strauss's songs, let us confess it, often seem
monotonous when half a dozen of them are sung in a row. It requires
a nice skill in selection to escape this. It can be escaped, for the
composer has been prolific and he has written some good things in the
pure lied style, which may be alternated with the others. But the
presence of this element of monotony is worth considering, because it
is a manifestation of a difficulty into which the present manner of
song writing is leading composers. Perhaps all the good tunes have
been written!

Melodic invention is a vital element in the making of songs. There
must be a thematic subject. No matter how far into the realm of
detailed declamation the composer may elect to go, he may not wholly
neglect the musical figure. If he does, he writes not song, but
recitative. The fundamental difference between lyric declamation
and pure recitative lies in the presence of the musical figure in
the former, and the musical figure is the root of melody. It is the
motive, the rhythmic and melodic germ.

If now we turn from the songs of Richard Strauss to those of the
much-lauded Hugo Wolf, we shall find that there is a difference in
this very matter. Wolf's melodic ideas are singularly vague and
deficient in directness of character. They do not come clean out upon
the ear as the proclamation of a master's embodiment of a poetic
thought; neither do they set a character or fix a mood. They easily
lose themselves in the speculative convolutions of that philosophic
declamation which is the peculiar fruit of contemporaneous
cultivation in the field of song. Intervallic difficulties abound in
these Wolf songs, and the harmonic basis is so strained at times that
the ear is outraged by the withholding of the normal resolutions of
the chords.

But these things are part and parcel of the musical affectation of
the time. Possibly twenty years hence these wrestings of musical
nature will have become sweetened by the uses of adversity, and the
ears of the very children will accept them as freely as they now do
the lush harmonies of "Träume" and "Im Treibhaus."

Wolf's artistic endeavor in song writing is clearly the same as that
of Richard Strauss, but the achievement is far different. To throw
songs by the two composers into close juxtaposition as is frequently
done in recitals is to inflict a needlessly cruel punishment on
Wolf. To interject into the programme one of the uncommon songs of
Schubert, such as "Dem Unendlichen," is still more cruel, for this
serves to show that the melodious Franz Peter could pen philosophic
apostrophe and oratoric declamation with the best of the moderns, and
yet remain more musical than any of them.

Strauss, be it said to his credit, never omits the proposition of
some sort of a musical theme. But his method is not that of the
elder lyric school. He is a romanticist of the ultra-modern type,
and carves out his musical forms over the pattern of his text with
infinite labor. He lays down a theme which sets a character and
indicates a point of aim; and then he develops, as I have already
noted, by the method of transition, so that new material springs from
the old in our very sight as the eastern conjurer's flowers grow from
the bare earth.

Wolf works on similar lines. He is not a conscious imitator, but his
method is the Strauss method, the method of Schubert's "Delphine"
buried under the twentieth-century manner. But Wolf lacks both the
directness of Schubert and the ingenuity of Strauss. His work in
many places rings false. It smells too often of the midnight forge
and the hammer of the driven quill. Schubert's song bursts from him
full grown, like Minerva from the head of Jove. Strauss's songs show
reflection and aspiration and loving care in their finish. Wolf's
echo with the sound of the workshop. They are by no means journeyman
work, but they are hewn out with hard labor and they do not give
forth the fragrance of utter spontaneity.

Questions will naturally arise as to the power of these songs to
stand comparison with the lyrics of the later Frenchmen. Reynaldo
Hahn, for example, also toys with the rarefied method, and paints
delicate impressionistic tone pictures. These are not ordinary songs,
but they will not bear the chilling spaces of the concert room. They
are for the salon, for the intimate communication of one at the piano
to another sitting beside it.

With a cigarette, a glass of Madeira (very mellow), lights half down,
as stage directions say, and a woman with whom you are not too much
in love singing to you in the point-lace wilderness, the songs of
Reynaldo Hahn will make of you an Omar Khayyam transformed into what
Mr. Kipling calls "a demnition product." If the woman is beautiful,
the Madeira soothing, and the cigarette mild, you will be ready to
swear that Hahn is the Schubert of the Boulevards. But if some one
sings Hahn to you as No. 4 on an afternoon programme in a rectangular
recital hall, you will vote the dainty French writer the essence of
puerility.

Another of these very precious gentlemen who has come into notice
is Alexandre Georges. Did you ever chance to hear his "Chansons de
Miarka," settings of texts of Jean Richepin's "Miarka, the Bear's
Foundling"? They are worth a hearing. The poems--consider such
titles as "Nuages," "La Poussière," "La Pluie," "La Parole"--are
mood pictures and invite musical treatment. The composer has done
well with them. He has done nothing new, to be sure, but he has made
himself comfortable in the well-kept museum of the obvious. He has
trotted in old-fashioned rhythm with the Romany, and he has rained a
glittering torrent of sixteenth notes along the upper steppes of the
keyboard.

But what can we ask? A Frenchman must not be disrespectful of the
vogue. These songs have atmosphere, and if it is painted in familiar
and safe tints, who shall blame a man for assuring himself of correct
methods? The declamation is generally clear and fluent, and the moods
of the poems are reproduced in the music with propriety and elegance.

But this is wandering. The point to be made--not a very important
one, perhaps--is that all these moderns, with Strauss, their best
man, in the lead, are experimenting. They are testing the power of
lyric composition to do without the poetic basis of metre. Without
metre they are compelled to develop their melodies by a new process,
and they seem likely to fall into the error of losing definite
musical figuration altogether. They declaim and recite. Their
accompaniments are miniature symphonic descriptions. Yet it has all
been done before. The two Schubert songs already named, and "Die
Allmacht" ought to show these gentlemen how to do what they seem to
be trying so hard to do without quite accomplishing their ends.




                            AUX ITALIENS




                     I.--ITALIAN OPERA OF TO-DAY

            What do ye singing? What is this ye sing?

                                SWINBURNE, _Atalanta in Calydon_.


Several factors have united in causing a new interest in the opera
of Italy. In so far as New York is concerned the singing together of
two such admirable exponents of the art of bel canto as Mme. Marcella
Sembrich and Enrico Caruso has restored to life some of the older
works, while a recent visit of Mascagni and the frequent performances
of Puccini's "La Bohème" and "Tosca" have directed serious attention
to the tendency of the younger art. The struggles of the youthful
school to maintain its national characteristics in the face of its
own yearnings after the flesh-pots of Wagnerism have afforded an
absorbing spectacle for observers of musical progress.

The leader and master of all these young eagles was, of course, the
incomparable Verdi, the most characteristic composer of opera Italy
ever brought forth. But although he showed them all precisely how
to mingle the fruits of the new fields opened by Wagner with those
of the old Italian soil, they have not always wisely accepted his
instruction. They have sought for independence in manner, and in some
instances with disheartening results. But perhaps a cursory review of
some of their achievements may not be in vain.

Doubtless the casual observer will be struck first by the
instrumentation of these modern Italians. Puccini's scores certainly
offer abundant food for study, and his clever adjustment of the
leading motive scheme to the instrumental background of a thoroughly
Italian vocal melody, as in "Tosca," is an accomplishment not to be
passed by with a smile. If we compare the scores of such works as
those of Puccini and Mascagni with the works of the Donizetti period,
we note with astonishment the immense strides made in the use of the
orchestra.

But we must not be deceived. The Donizettian period was one of
reaction. The Gluck-Piccini battle had not long since been fought out
in Paris, and the principles of dramatic verity in opera had once
more been vindicated, but at the cost of a great public weariness.
The classic polish and repose of Gluck's music were intellectually
satisfying, but his scores lacked the vital heat to keep warm the
blood of the artistically indolent. To this day the best works of
Gluck invite our admiration, but seldom awaken our feelings. The
idle, pleasure-seeking public of Europe soon turned again to its
strumming ditties. It threw itself at the feet of Rossini, and within
forty years after the establishment of Gluck's superiority in Paris
the whole Continent was beating time to "Di tanti palpiti."

Once more the Voice was the deity of the operatic stage, and woe
betide the composer who so wrote for his orchestra as to interfere
with its supremacy. Rossini, who had artistic aspirations in spite of
all his insincerity and intellectual laziness, made many improvements
in operatic writing. It was he who first omitted from an opera all
use of the old-fashioned dry recitative and used throughout that
which has the support of the orchestra. He enriched the manner of
writing for horns and clarinets, and he introduced instrumental
effects which later composers have adopted with good effect. But,
nevertheless, "William Tell" was a failure, and Rossini sulked in his
tent for thirty years, while Bellini and Donizetti turned out their
nursery operas, in which the orchestra has been likened to a "big
guitar."

The advance in orchestral writing in opera after this time is often
erroneously attributed wholly to Wagner, but undoubtedly it is the
king of all musical charlatans, Meyerbeer, who should have the lion's
share of the honor. When Wagner was a young, struggling, and utterly
unknown composer, seeking for an opening in Paris, he threw himself
at the feet of Meyerbeer, who was the idol of both the French and the
Prussian capitals. Meyerbeer's operas were already known throughout
Europe, and to their cheap and tawdry orchestral effects the later
composers no doubt owed the suggestion that with the orchestra much
might be said that could not be given to the voices. Subsequently the
leaven of Wagnerism permeated European musical art, but the despised
Meyerbeer undoubtedly pointed out to many writers the path which led
back toward the true source of Italian operatic composition.

For in the beginning of opera, Monteverde experimented with
orchestral effects, chiefly descriptive, to be sure, but indicating
what might be done. Lully afterward developed some ideas as to
dramatic expression in the instrumental score, and these were
further expanded by Gluck. The progress along this path was checked
temporarily by the reaction in favor of cheap tunes for the display
of voices. Verdi took up the development of the orchestral part of
Italian opera where Rossini left off, and in his early works wrote
in a style that bears more than a family resemblance to that of
"William Tell." But Verdi was a man of broad vision, an assimilator
of universal ideas, and he was not slow to recognize the drift of
operatic art. He discerned the rising importance of the orchestral
score and realized the full value of the instrumental adjunct. In
"Aïda" he utilized to their utmost capacity its resources in coloring
and in "Otello" he placed in the orchestra some of the most important
and significant passages of his music,--passages which went further
than anything in the setting of the text itself toward the complete
explication of the emotions working in the drama. In "Falstaff" he
used the orchestra as a commentator on the humor of every situation,
and even succeeded in making it aid in the interpretation of
Falstaff's ridiculous philosophy.

One has only to hearken for a minute to Mascagni's use of the basses
in "Cavalleria Rusticana" to recognize the source of his knowledge.
"Otello," with its wonderful bass recitative in the murder scene, was
produced in 1887; "Cavalleria Rusticana" was brought out in 1890.
Mascagni's dramatic treatment of the orchestral part of the lyric
drama is no mere imitation, however; it is a part of the general
movement in Italian opera which began with Verdi's "Aïda" and which
may without difficulty be traced back through Boito's "Mefistofele"
(of which the first version was produced in 1868) to Rossini's
"William Tell." The advance was akin to that made in all species of
music. The first experiments were in the direction of description by
means of imitative figuration. These are what we find in "Tell." The
allotment to the orchestra of the emotional background of the drama
was bound to come later, in the natural order of things. Mascagni
stands in the direct line of progress in this matter, and his
contribution to the general results is, though small, nevertheless
worthy of remark.

How much he and Leoncavallo and Puccini owe to Ponchielli would be
hard to determine. The composer of "La Gioconda" was somewhat ahead
of his time, and his work was not fairly understood when it was new.
But in one feature of operatic composition suggested by this work all
the later composers seem inclined to go too far. They are striving
to follow Verdi in his earnest attempt to set every phrase of the
text of "Otello" to music perfectly adapted to the expression of its
meaning. But Verdi avoided the fatal error into which these young
Italians are falling. He never went so far as to obliterate from his
scores all trace of melodic character.

If one were to take a dozen or twenty pages of "Tosca," "Pagliacci,"
"Iris," and "Zanetto," shuffle them together and then play them,
it would be almost impossible for any ordinary lover of music to
distinguish the writing of one composer from that of another.
"Zanetto" sounds as much like Puccini as like Mascagni, and the
composer of "Iris" might have written almost any page of "La Bohème."
This work, however, bears the same relation to Puccini's other works
as "Cavalleria Rusticana" does to the other operas of Mascagni. It is
well supplied with clearly formed melodies. That is the real reason
of the wide popularity of "Cavalleria Rusticana." Rarely sinking
below the level of passionate expression demanded by the intense
tragedy of the story, it is always purely lyric, and its melodies
stamp themselves upon the memory.

The other works for the most part seem to wander along in endless
stretches of melodious phrases, which have no closely organized
relation to each other. They sound well, for these Italians have the
trick of writing well for the singer. But they are open confessions
of a fear of becoming tuneful in the old Italian style of Donizetti
and Rossini. These young men seem to be constantly on the verge of
writing in the aria form and of avoiding it only by thrusting in some
unnatural modulation or some unexpected cadence. They seem to be
striving for an endless melody, like Wagner's, which is not congenial
to them. They forget that when the emotional conditions of the scene
pointed to melodious music Wagner was frankly melodic, and that he
wrote as lyrically as Schubert himself, though naturally constructing
his melodies on a larger frame. Think of the joyous carol of the
Rhine maidens in the water-woven vision of the first scene of the
great trilogy; of the hard-wrung tribute of the crafty Loge to
"Weibes Wonne und Werth"; of the love song of Siegmund, the duet
between him and Sieglinde, the heart-rending farewell of the stricken
god in the last scene; of Siegfried's Titanic cradle song to his
infant sword; of the nightingale twitter of the forest bird, of the
throbbing love duet of the third act of "Siegfried"; of the ebullient
duet in the first scene of "Götterdämmerung"; of the chorus of
Gunther's men, of the narrative of Siegfried, and of the stupendous
threnody of Brünnhilde's immolation. Wagner was not afraid to write
songs when he needed them in his art.

It is a grave mistake to sell the Italian birthright of vocal melody
for a mess of orchestral pottage. And it is altogether unnecessary.
These young Italians must let alone their attempts to set reason
to music. Their latest librettos contain too much philosophizing
and not enough passion. Zanetto is altogether too sophisticated to
be typical. Sylvia thinks too much. Osaka in "Iris" is altogether
too much a man of the world. Iris is a human doll. Kyoto is an
accomplished speculator in human folly. These are not figures to be
animated with great music. They forbid its presence. These young
Italians must get back to a realization of the fundamental truth
that music is the speech of emotion. Love, hate, fear, elation,
depression, grief,--these are for music to interpret. But you cannot
discuss Christianity and positivism in lyrics, nor make intelligent
comment in six-eight time on the causes of poverty. The limitations
of music are far smaller even than those of lyric poetry, yet its
field is as large as that of the true drama, for it is that of all
human emotion.

Do they need a model? Well, there is one of whom they seemingly know
not. Away back in the years before even Rossini assailed flaccid
Paris with the strenuous peal of "William Tell," a German boy of
seventeen wrote in 1814 a song called "Gretchen am Spinnrade," and
the following year he cast upon the waters that marvellous condensed
drama "Der Erl-König." In the five minutes of that one song by Franz
Peter Schubert lies the history of a human soul. It is an epitome
of emotion, and the piano does quite as much as the voice--but
not more--in the expression. If the young Italians would like to
learn something more than they already know about the way to build
condensed opera, let them study the songs of Schubert. There they
will find a solution of the problem of how to combine perfect vocal
melody with a dramatic accompaniment without sacrificing one iota of
dramatic verity.

An additional question of high import is whether these young
firebrands are not setting the torch to the roots of nationality in
their art. It is useless for theoreticians to argue that there is
no nationality in music. There is nationality in all art, and the
"Virgin" painted by Rubens is a Flemish woman just as surely as she
is Italian when limned by Michael Angelo. There never was a German
who could have conceived the lilt of "Funiculi, funicula," nor an
Italian who could have composed "Schwesterlein." No Russian could
have penned the dainty "Pierre et sa Mie," nor could a Frenchman
have imagined "Ay Ouchnem." Only an Englishman could have written
"Rule Britannia," of which Wagner said that the first four measures
contained the whole character of the English people.

Nationality shows itself most conspicuously in song. Instrumental
music is at best an artificial species. Its forms, its methods, are
handed from one nation to another, and the Harvard graduate builds
his symphony upon the Viennese model of Papa Haydn. But the musical
idioms of a people cannot be kept out of their songs. The folk song
was ignored successfully for a thousand years, but in certain happy
days of the Middle Ages it wooed and won the fugue, and modern
music, strong with the strength of musical science, beautiful with
the beauty of spontaneous emotional utterance, was the fruit of this
union. But for all time the idiom of the folk song colored the vocal
art. The musical idioms imposed themselves on the scientific basis,
and when a German or a Frenchman or an Italian composed a song, he
composed it with a counterpoint common through all Europe, but with
the melodic idiom of the songs of his own people.

The Italians of to-day have not wholly forgotten the essentials
of their native melody. Indeed, their composing betrays a deep
self-consciousness. They see the character of their own music and
try to escape it, and it is of this very act that complaint is here
made. But the fundamentals of Italian melody are not entirely lost.
The pages of Puccini's "Manon," "La Bohème," and "Tosca" are not
completely devoid of song which is indisputably Italian. No one would
ever mistake it for French or German. But it is no longer the melody
of Donizetti and Bellini. That is well. The Italian masters of the
beginning of this century wrote tunes for their own sake without
thought of their dramatic expressiveness, and Donizetti did not
hesitate to stop the entire action of his "Lucia" at one of the most
critical points in order that the famous sextet might be sung.

The modern Italians do not fall into that sort of error. They are
striving with all their power to compose dramatically. They are
striving, too, to preserve Italian music, and for this all honor
should be shown them. More than that, they have shown plainly the
path along which Italian music should advance. They have demonstrated
beyond question that the aria, which was the central sun of the old
Neapolitan system of opera, is wholly unessential. They have shown
that the dialogue of the lyric drama can be carried on in a musical
speech which is melodious, but not dominated by musical patterns.
They have illustrated to the full the possibilities of a flexible and
eloquent recitative. They have carried to a high degree of excellence
the art of fitting the musical accent to the word, and the contour of
the phrase to the natural inflection of the speech. This they have
done, too, in the full knowledge that their art in this detail is
quite lost upon the general public and appeals only to a few studious
critics of their music.

They have abolished from the Italian stage the foolish repetitions
of lines of the text as syllables on which to hang cadenzas. They
have wiped out the empty colorature song, designed solely for the
amazement of groundlings and for the glorification of the prima
donna. They have almost terminated the career of the prima donna
herself, and substituted for her, if not the singing actress of
Wagner, at least an acting songstress. They have placed Italian opera
beside French in its honest search after theatric directness. Italian
opera is no longer music and nothing else: it is what its early
fathers intended it should be, _drama per musica_.

The movement of the young Italians toward dramatic verity, as already
noted, did not originate in a weak surrender to the conquest of
Europe by Wagner. The "Gioconda" of Ponchielli, produced in 1876,
shows not a single trace of Wagnerian influence; and yet to that work
as much as to any other are the young Italians indebted. They have
travelled the path on which Ponchielli was moving, but they have gone
much farther than he did. Ponchielli utilized the orchestral forces
with high skill, and his dramatic recitative was far ahead of that
found in Verdi's earlier works. For a second-rate master he attained
extraordinary influence over his successors. Alas! that suggests that
they are even less than second-rate, and it is quite possible that
the near future will decide that they were less than third-rate. But
we of the present must take them as they appear to us, and endeavor
to learn from their works whither operatic music is tending.

Boito's "Mefistofele," which is as old as 1868, gave these young
Italians much to think of, so much indeed that one can trace a good
deal more than a family resemblance between the introduction of
Mascagni's "Iris" and the prologue in heaven in the Boito work. But
the young men have striven again to make advances. That they have
endeavored to introduce into their music an Italianized Wagnerism is
the fault for which they must be most severely blamed, for in doing
this they have wandered away from true nationalism and have betrayed
their birthright.

It is not possible in a brief essay to point out the details of the
methods of these young men. It may be said, however, that what they
have apparently striven to do is to rear a distorted vocal structure,
composed of the elements of the older Italian singing style, upon
a foundation of acrid, restless, changeful, distressful harmonies.
It may perhaps be injudicious to find fault with them for this, for
no thoughtful observer of musical progress can fail to see that
toward something new and strange in harmonic sequences all music is
advancing. One needs only to think of the French operas of Bruneau
and Charpentier, the piano music of the young Russians, the vast
orchestral tone-riddles of Richard Strauss. If the use of strictly
technical terms may be allowed, the harmony of to-day is no longer
diatonic; it is not even chromatic; it is the harmony of the minor
second. In other words, it is the harmony in which the sharpest
of all dissonances, that of two tones only a semitone apart, is
prevalent. In the presence of this style of harmony the chord of the
diminished seventh becomes as gentle as the tonic triad, for music is
filled with what the eloquent and witty James Huneker once happily
called "diseased chords of the twenty-sixth."

This style of harmony is not natural to Italian music. The genius
of Italian song is utterly opposed to it. The proclivities of the
Italian people are inimical to it. It is not adapted to the methods
and traditions of the Italian lyric drama, and it has not been found
necessary by the writers of the greatest masterpieces of Italian
opera. Verdi and Boito were able to construct their notable works
without it. Mascagni, on the other hand, has forced his music into
this uncongenial way. His "Iris" teems with harsh and discordant
harmonies, and in order to set the melodic voice-parts on this uneasy
basis he has been compelled to twist the melodic curves of Italian
song into unseemly angles.

Now these are facts. Just what they are to signify in the progress
of musical art only a very confident person would venture to predict.
Where is Italian opera? That question we may answer. Whither is it
going? To that we can only hazard a reply. We may, too, be wholly
wrong in supposing that it is an evil day for art when Italian opera
sacrifices anything of its intense nationality for the sake of
rivalling the drastic music-drama of Richard Wagner. Critics are not
prophets. They can only study the conditions of art in their own day,
and try to reconcile them with those standards which the experience
of time has shown to be the highest. As Mr. Webster once intimated,
the only way to judge of the future is by the past. That method
points to the conclusion that nothing good will come of the effort to
dethrone the national genius. On the other hand, this effort looks
amazingly like a confession of weakness.

It looks as if the young Italians were not of fruitful inventiveness
in the production of thematic ideas. All the good tunes have not
been written yet. John Stuart Mill confessed that for a time he was
troubled with a fear that because there were only seven tones in the
scale all the possible melodic ideas were nearly exhausted. But it
has been noted that in spite of the immense drain made on the scale
by Bach and Mozart and Weber and Beethoven and Schubert and Schumann
there were still tunes enough to make a Dvorak, a Tschaïkowsky, a
Brahms, and a Wagner.




                II.--THE CLASSIC OF THE UNPROGRESSIVE

            But how may he find Arcady
            Who hath nor youth nor melody?

                               H. C. BUNNER, _The Way to Arcady_.


In these tumultuous times of Strauss and Wagner, with the furies
of intellectual realism pursuing us and the sirens of seductive
emotionalism panting before us, the persistence with which
Donizetti's "Lucia di Lammermoor" clings to the lyric stage impels us
toward the complacent conclusion that this work is become the classic
of the musically unprogressive. This seems a hazardous statement,
yet it may be shown without undue effort to enjoy a substantial and
definite basis. The names of Racine and Molière, of Gluck and Lully,
rise before the memory when the term "classic" is employed, but one
should also not forget that there are thousands of well-intentioned
persons to whom that is classic which is just far enough above the
level of their ordinary thought to command respect. To the whistler
of operetta jingles all music not to be whistled is classic.
Stendahl said, in making a distinction too often made arbitrarily:
"Romanticism is the art of presenting to people the literary works
which, in the actual state of their habits and beliefs, are capable
of giving them the greatest possible pleasure; classicism, on the
contrary, of presenting them with that which gave the greatest
possible pleasure to their grandfathers."

If this demarcation of Stendahl's be correct, then "Lucia" is
twice blessed in that it is both classic and romantic. For there
is no doubt that it gave much pleasure to our grandfathers, nor
is there any room for suspicion that it is not congenial to a
"popular" audience in the actual state of its habits and beliefs.
No doubt, indeed, there is a sort of gentle romanticism in "Lucia."
The personages are of the class of lords and ladies, and there is
something quite imposing in the strut of their boots and the waving
of their feathers. One must even be impressed by the sight of the
noble Scotch maiden wandering in the forest in a long-trained gown
accompanied by a companion who wears low neck and short sleeves. We
realize that we are in fashionable company, and we prepare for the
worst. When Edgardo marches upon the scene just as Lucia has signed
the futile contract, our expectations are realized, and we gaze upon
the revelation of the secrets of high life with an interest almost
as direct and eloquent as that of the chorus itself. The madness of
Lucy, accompanied by the winsome and ingenuous accents of the flute,
touches us deeply, and when Edgardo, wandering among the tombs of
his sainted fathers, learns that Lucy has ceased to live, and stabs
himself, breathing out his life in that sweet melody (with chorus),
"A te vengo," we are dissolved in tears.

This is romanticism in truth, and unless he be of those who preserve
in middle age the intellectual grasp of childhood, one cannot find in
this work any qualities of the classic beyond its familiarity to our
grandfathers, except in the meaning of the dictum of Sainte-Beuve,
"Les ouvrages anciens ne sont pas classiques parce qu'ils sont vieux,
mais parce qu'ils sont energiques, frais, dispos." Now this last word
is open to misconstruction. It may mean "cheerful" and it may mean
"disposed" or "orderly." In the case of "Lucia" either meaning will
answer, for it is the "energique" rather than the "dispos" that makes
us trouble in the application of the definition of Sainte-Beuve.
There are fuss and fury in the strenuous utterances of the tenor in
the scene of the tearing of the contract, but these can hardly be
called energy in the meaning in which the French author was using the
word. Youthful and cheerful, innocent and ingenuous,--these, indeed,
are adjectives which may well be applied to the masterpiece of the
composer of "Il Castello di Kenilworth" and other operas. For those
who are living in the past of musical art "Lucia" is a classic, and
it is also a living romance. It gave joy to their grandfathers, and
it sends through their own nerves mild thrills, not discomforting,
and not impeded by intellectual problems in tone.

When one comes beyond the "Lucia" period in operatic art, he may
fairly enroll himself in the ranks of those whom Walter Pater calls
"spiritual adventurers,"--those who are ready to put out on unknown
seas of art experience and who are notable for their active mistrust
of the teachings of their grandfathers. Some of these are fools, but
this fact only serves to remind one of a wise saying of that very
wise man, Robert Louis Stevenson: "Shelley was a young fool, and so
are these cock-sparrow revolutionaries. But it is better to be a fool
than to be dead. It is better to emit a scream in the shape of a
theory than to be entirely insensible to the jars and incongruities
of life and take everything as it comes in a forlorn stupidity."

It is seldom that men take things as they come in music in this
"forlorn stupidity," for they set themselves stubbornly against
the new. Yet the attitude of those who sit in amiable comfort at
performances of "Lucia" and who go away saying, "Now that's the kind
of music I like," with a tremendous accent on the "I,"--an accent
which is plainly the thank-offering of the Pharisee,--they are surely
insensible to the jars, if not to the incongruities, of the modern
musical world. And the spiritual adventurers will presently say to
them: "We are at the parting of our ways. Linger you, if you will, in
the valley with your Donizetti and his three-four ditties and his big
guitar. We are for the mountain with Wagner and Tschaïkowsky and the
thunder-storms."

But perchance it may occur to you to question whether they are not
happier in their serene movelessness than those who are continually
scaling heights. There is even some doubt about this, for they
experience occasional twinges of discomfort when they hear of
persons enjoying exclusive satisfaction in such works as "Falstaff"
or "Otello" or "Die Meistersinger," which are to them poppy and
mandragora. But there is something more pitiable than this in their
sad state. That is their inability to enjoy the classics of the
musically progressive.

The man or woman who is not subservient to a factitious taste
in music, who has not habituated the intellectual palate to the
enjoyment of Wagner alone, or of Rossini alone,--he it is whose soul
is enriched by a wider range of impressions. For him no flower of
music blooms in vain. For him there is some very special loveliness
in the operas written before the flood-gates of modern romanticism
were opened. For him there is still edification in the stately
measures of Gluck's "Orfeo," and there is a fountain of inexhaustible
pleasure in the immortal "Don Giovanni" of Mozart. To him the latter,
in particular, is a perennial "Fons Bandusiae, splendidior vitro."
Ability to penetrate to the heart of these works is an evidence of
musical aristocracy. They are not for the common herd. The children
of melodic and harmonic darkness are not enlightened by them. They
shine for the few, the chosen few, who march with Music herself as
their leader. To hear "Lucia" after one of these is like drinking
iced water after eating ice-cream. The Donizettian masterpiece
becomes suddenly lukewarm.

It has been said that in art there is no such thing as standing
still. But the appreciation of art is surely a different matter.
Music, the youngest of the arts, is in the very press of her first
forward march. She is in the possession of the priceless gift of
unwearied strength. Her technical resources have not as yet been
fully explored. She has mines of mere matter which have not yet been
opened up. Her future is big with promise. But whatever that future
may be, it will be the direct product of her past. She will never be
able to cut the chains that bind her to Bach any more than poetry can
break the bonds which tie her to David, the son of Jesse. Some of us
are prone to forget this, and to think that we are of the army of
progress when we neglect Bach and Beethoven and the prophets for the
preachers of our own era. But there would have been no Brahms without
a Haydn, and there would have been no Wagner without a Mozart.

It requires an æsthetic immobility unfortunately none too rare to
stand still and enjoy "Lucia di Lammermoor" and "La Sonnambula" in
a period when the whole spirit and outward form of musical art are
tending directly away from them. The fact that so many persons can
do it is but an evidence of what we know to our regret; namely, that
most men and women refuse to take these things seriously. They hold
that the opera is only a form of amusement and that it is absurd to
fall into disputes about it. Art is a pretty word to them; but if its
meaning includes a command that they are to regard their "amusements"
with grave eyes and to exercise the faculties of their minds upon
them, away with it to the realms of outer darkness!

This is not an attitude which history encourages. Men have always
been stern in the defence of their playthings, and they have always
taken their pleasures very seriously. The whole Trojan war was about
a man's passing fancy for a woman. More bitter wars than that have
been waged for the sake of acquiring wealth and power, and to what
end? That the possessors might buy playthings therewith. Grown-up
children have their toys, but they wear graver aspects than the dolls
and Noah's Arks of childhood. Sometimes the dolls become soldiers and
the arks battleships in the nursery of a German Emperor. And so the
world suddenly realizes that the pursuit of amusements is a large
game, while his Majesty, perchance, practises a little music now and
then, that some day he may fiddle while Rome burns.

Some of us are content to remain awake to the fact that, as Taine
says, "At bottom there is nothing truly sweet and beautiful in life
but our dreams," and to feel that this lovely art of music is a
chief among these dreams. Those of us who are of this mind naturally
enough plume ourselves on our relationship to the kings who have
made wars for playthings. But we have a secret satisfaction in the
assurance that when the kings are forgotten and the boundaries of
their kingdoms blotted from the maps of the world, the art of music
will still be in the possession of the hearts of men. And then we
wonder if the musically unprogressive will still be clinging to their
jingling classic, "Lucia di Lammermoor"?

It is not a question to be answered lightly, for in these days the
number of the lovers of "Lucia" is not to be estimated by the size
of the audiences in the great opera-houses. There the fashion of the
hour rules, and the mellow thunders of Wagner are enjoyed even with
the lights turned down and the gowns in the gloom of a very precious
manifestation of musical progress. It is in the unfashionable
theatres that we must look for the evidences of the continued
popularity of the masterpiece of the incontinent Donizetti. For the
audiences of these houses are distinguished by a noble independence
of thought. They like what they like, and they do not care who
disapproves of it. And they adore "Lucia" even unto this day. But
they do not love Mozart on the one hand, nor Wagner and the senescent
Verdi on the other. And for that reason they are at a standstill.
They are the inglorious army of the musically unprogressive.

Out of this conclusion may come an inference as false as it is
unattractive. If the lovers of "Lucia" are unprogressive, is, then,
a great singer who still sings this part their leader? One may be
tempted for a moment to utilize an apt jest and say with one of Mr.
Gilbert's most delightful personages, "Bless you, it all depends."
If the great artist is great only by reason of the manner in which
she sings Lucia, then she is a star of the unprogressive. But if she
chance to be Marcella Sembrich and to sing Mozart as beautifully
as she sings Donizetti and with the added understanding which is
essential to the interpretation of the classic of the progressive,
then she is a leader of progress, although she still finds a field
for the exercise of her talents in the world of the complacent.

And if the artist be a tenor and be called Caruso, then he may sing
Edgardo and die of an aromatic melody in the moonlight amid general
blessings.




                       THE ORATORIO OF TO-DAY

            Praise the Lord with harp: sing unto him with the psaltery
            and an instrument of ten strings. Sing unto Him a new song:
            play skilfully with a loud noise.

                                                _Psalms_ xxxiii. 2, 3.


England, where, as Mr. Gilbert was good enough to tell us in
"Iolanthe," every child is born either a Liberal or a Conservative,
leans both ways within the comfortable domain of oratorio. Chorus
answers unto chorus and fugues pursue the even tenor (or bass, as
the case may be) of their way, as they did in the brave days of old,
when the Saxon sputtered in the Haymarket and threatened to pitch
recalcitrant prima donnas out of windows. The festival of the three
choirs preserves for the edification of a prosaic and stiffnecked
generation the majestic sonorities of Handel and the subtle
intimacies of the introspective Bach.

The prancing of Elgar into this peaceful world with his pocket full
of leading motives, with a dramatization of the very throne of the
Invisible, and a suggestion of the Mary Magdalen of Wagner, neither
astonishes nor stirs the critics. The harsh yell of the shofar
disturbs them no more than the profound rumble of the contrabassoon.
And since Mendelssohn left his "Elijah" ceaselessly clamoring for the
costumes, the action, and the footlights of the stage, no Englishman
is to be set staring by the projection of a sacred drama upon his
field of vision.

After all, it was only in the day of Handel that the Bishop of London
decided for us that oratorios should no more be acted. How do we know
that, if things continue to go forward along the present lines, we
shall not have a later bishop determining that the oratorio ought
to be acted and thereby excluded from the hallowed precincts of
famous cathedral towns? Then the censorious throng which has looked
askance upon the New World performances of "Parsifal" would find that
panorama of a young pilgrim's progress as innocuous as one of the
"Four Serious Songs" of Brahms.

To those who watch with some solicitude the march of musical
progress, it looks as if we were in the midst of a transition in
the world of oratorio. A very peaceful transition, indeed, it is;
for we are no longer to be excited by a comparison of Handel with
other masters. We care not a pinch of snuff whether Coleridge-Taylor
be a genius or not. We go once a year to hear "The Messiah," and
occasionally we remember with a sort of mild surprise that Handel
also wrote "Israel in Egypt." When Mr. Elgar comes along with his
revolutionary notions, compounded of Carissimi, Handel, Mendelssohn,
and Wagner, we view them with a placidity which would be amusing were
it not so stupid. The times have changed, indeed, since Gray wrote to
Swift, on Feb. 23, 1723:--

    "As for the reigning amusement of the town, it is entirely
    music; real fiddles, bass viols and hautboys; not poetical
    harps, lyres and reeds. There's nobody allowed to say 'I
    sing' but an eunuch or an Italian woman. Everybody is grown
    now as great a judge of music as they were in your time of
    poetry, and folks that could not distinguish one tune from
    another now daily dispute about the different styles of
    Handel, Bononcini and Attilio. People have forgot Homer and
    Virgil and Cæsar; or at least, they have lost their ranks.
    For in London and Westminster, in all polite conversations,
    Senesino is daily voted to be the greatest man that ever
    lived."

True, this pother was all anent opera, which even to this day
evokes a considerable gush of invalid comment about glorified tenors
and sopranos. At least the men of the opera to-day are actually
masculine, but there is an echo of the Handelian period in the
adoration of tenors. But that, as the pleasant Mr. Kipling was wont
to say in his pleasantest tales, is another story. It was but a
flight of years till London town cackled as busily about Handel's
oratorios as it had about his operas. A private letter from London,
printed in Faulkner's Journal (Dublin) of March 12, 1743, said:--

    "Our friend, Mr. Handel, is very well, and things have taken
    quite a different turn here from what they did some time
    past; for the publick will no longer be imposed on by Italian
    singers and wrong-headed undertakers of bad operas, but
    find out the merit of Mr. Handel's compositions and English
    performances. The new oratorio (called Samson) which he
    composed since he left Ireland, has been performed four times
    to more crowded audiences than ever were seen; more people
    being turned away for want of room each night than hath been
    at the Italian opera."

Nevertheless, even in those days there was little enough distinction
between the styles of the opera and the oratorio, and not many
years before Handel's day there had been none at all. Both opera
and oratorio sprang from the same soil and were nurtured by the
same fount, the drama of Greece. Cavaliere's "Anima e Corpo" was
a delectable theatrical performance, prepared under the direction
of a very good man, St. Philip Neri, with the laudable aim of
drawing young persons away from the vulgar secular shows of Rome in
the dawn of the seventeenth century. Like "Die Zauberflöte" this
oratorio ended with a chorus, "to be sung, accompanied sedately and
reverentially by the dance." How deep was the reverence and how
reposeful the sedateness may be gathered from the fact that the
ballet was "enlivened with capers or _entrechats_."

A religious drama it was, this early oratorio, and it battled its way
into popularity by the mighty power of music. Its arch-enemy was the
old mystery and miracle play, which made of every religious story
something more lively than even an oratorio with a ballet enriched
with capers. To combat the attractiveness of the popular religious
play the oratorio had to cling to the stage, the costume, and the
footlights, and it would have been little stranger to read in the
time of Carissimi (1582-1672) than it was, in the century before his
birth, the famous Coventry bill of expenses, which contains these
items.

  Paid for a pair of gloves for God                       2d.
  Paid for four pairs of angels' wings                2s. 8d.
  Paid for mending of hell head                           6d.
  Paid for a pound of hemp to mend the angels' heads      4d.

But Carissimi, and still more directly after him Stradella,
advanced the oratorio toward a style in which acting was to become
incongruous. Stradella had the Handelian feeling for mass effects.
He perceived the true use of the great chorus, and he piled up
majestic climaxes with a skill marvellous for his time. He died four
years before Handel was born, but he had already carved out that
definiteness of structure which is so salient a feature of Handel's
works. The drift away from the dramatic character had already begun.
Indeed, Dr. Parry in his admirable "Evolution of the Art of Music"
expresses doubt that even the works of Carissimi can have been
intended for action. Still, we must not forget that whether oratorio
should or should not be acted remained an unsettled question till the
decision of the good Dr. Gibson, Bishop of London, in Handel's day.

However, a comprehensive view of the works of Handel and Bach shows
that the oratorio had in their time been clearly differentiated in
style and purpose from the opera. Bach's employment of the tenor
narrator places his Passions on a ground far removed from the
pictorial presentation of the stage. We know, too, that Bach wrote
for church performance. Handel's oratorios designed for the concert
platform were quite as far away as Bach's from the manner of the
theatre, though they departed in a different direction.

Dear old Papa Haydn, who wept with emotion when he heard the
Hallelujah chorus and exclaimed, "He is the master of us all," was
even less dramatic than either Handel or Bach, for although they
used no dramatic forms, they had their mighty outbursts of emotional
expression; while their declamation, as well as their massive
climaxes, often rises far above the trumpery effects of the opera of
their period.

But Haydn was a most gentle spirit. He was too full of the fluid
of humility and too much given to amiable reflection to approach
dramatic effects. His music in both the "Creation" and "The Seasons"
is descriptive, commentary, and speculative. It is delightful and it
is exceedingly mild. It dwells comfortably in a peaceful atmosphere
very remote from that of the nervous theatricalism of Carissimi or
the impulsive eloquence of Stradella. It is just as far, too, from
the poignant intensity of the psychic personification found in Bach's
music. Bach's Christ is the living Son of God, but always in the
heavens. It is a Christ of the inmost soul, not of the imaginative
eye. It is a Christ of the heart, and has no pictorial form.

But Haydn sets a world before us, and lets us hear the rushing
of the waters and the sighing of the winds. It was reserved for a
thoroughly cultivated master to unify in his work the elements found
in all these predecessors. Mendelssohn, without letting go of the
Protestant chorale, which was so potent in the Bach Passion, or
the massed chorus which Handel learned from Stradella how to use,
or the orchestral description of Haydn, or the flexible recitative
of Carissimi, succeeded in producing a new form of purely dramatic
oratorio. His "Elijah" flashed forth as a religious opera. It might
be put on the stage and acted. It stands almost perfectly adapted
to such use, and would certainly prove far more influential in the
theatre than "Anima e Corpo" did even in its own day. Mendelssohn was
not a mighty genius, but he was a most clever adapter.

Since his day oratorio has wavered between the Italian dramatic form
of the earliest period and a modernization of the Bach form. English
composers have over and over again written for their festivals on the
lines of Handel or Mendelssohn, seemingly without a clear discernment
of the inner characteristics which differentiated the two.
Continental composers have made all sorts of experiments. Gounod even
tried in his "Redemption" to show how the melodic style of "Faust"
could be superimposed on the ground plan of Bach. It is needless to
say that the scheme met with a cheering failure. Oil and water would
not mix.

Edgar Tinel, whose "St. Franciscus" was produced in Brussels in 1888,
was the first to make a deliberate attempt to return to the earliest
dramatic form of the Italians. He certainly did not contemplate a
stage performance, but he wrote in the fashion of the lyric drama
of his time. He used the whole apparatus of the German opera except
the leading motive. But Tinel failed in one important particular. He
was unable to use the means of the opera without making it produce
the speech of the theatre. His oratorio smells of the stage. It is a
religious drama only because its story is in a measure religious. The
music and much of the thought are, to say the least, secular. It may
not be going too far to say that sometimes they are profane.

Now, what has Edward Elgar accomplished, and what does the character
of his work indicate as the present tendency of oratorio? In his
musical method he has striven to demonstrate that Bach and Wagner
were of one blood. And, indeed, who that has heard the twining
polyphony of five themes near the end of the "Meistersinger" prelude
ever doubted that both of these masters sprang from the loins of
Palestrina, the son of the house of Ockeghem? Elgar has preserved for
the necessity of oratorio the narrator, though he has diversified his
recitation by dividing it among the voices.

This preservation of the narrator is the one characteristic of the
contemporaneous oratorio form which proclaims to the world that the
mandate of the Bishop of London is still in force. Nothing else in
the score would disclose this fact. Everything is constructed on
dramatic lines; everything is conceived in the mood of Mendelssohn's
"Elijah." The tremendous picture of the entrance of the soul of
Gerontius into the shrine of the Invisible and the descriptive speech
of Mary Magdalen on her tower, accompanied by the sounds of the orgy,
demand most eloquently the accompaniment of pictorial scenes. And
these are but two examples taken at random from scores prolific in
similar instances.

The distribution of the narrative among several voices is the method
of Handel, but in the treatment of the choruses Elgar has learned
still more from that master. Here we have lessons accepted from both
Bach and the Saxon, and in the dawn of the twentieth century we find
a product of the skill of Stradella in handling huge masses of tone.

In the employment of one set of choruses representative of actors
in the story and another of purely commentary nature, Elgar has
followed Bach's method in "The Passion." He has honored aged custom
in allotting the words of Jesus to a bass voice. The treatment of the
post-ascension speeches of the Saviour as choral, or many-voiced, is
as old as Heinrich Schütz.

Furthermore, Mr. Elgar has preserved the ecclesiastic character in
his music by adhering to the use of the polyphonic devices which
were created by church composers and which have sternly resisted the
efforts of the ablest masters, even of Verdi, to lend themselves
to the restless utterance of the music drama. Elgar's polyphony is
by no means stencilled in form; his fugues are not fugues of the
North German pattern. He handles single and double counterpoint with
consummate ease and with the assured freedom of one who dares to
depart from the beaten path without fear of disaster.

Added to this is the employment of a harmonic style which belongs
entirely to the present day. Mr. Elgar's polyphony is built on a
harmonic basis which almost completely ignores the ecclesiastic
tonalities of the earlier church writers and utilizes the diatonic
and chromatic scheme of the present, the method of Wagner's "Tristan
und Isolde." It is as far from Handel as it is from Mendelssohn.
Its source is without question the inexhaustible fount of musical
learning, the music of Sebastian Bach, but it is Bach studied by the
lamp of Brahms and recited with the tongue of Wagner.

Brahms was himself a filter of Bach, and this might seem to indicate
that the Sebastianism of Elgar was exceeding thin. But the English
writer, while considering the work of the composer of the "German
Requiem," has accepted suggestions from it only as to manner. For the
original matter he has gone back to the real master of all masters.
In his recitatives he again has shown a profound understanding of the
psychologic nature of Bach's declamation. Upon it, as a foundation,
he has reared a style of his own, very flexible, full of variety and
as changeful in its harmonic undercurrents as a sunset sky.

To these derivations from the art of Bach and others Elgar has
added much of the material of to-day's music. In the first place, he
has permitted the diatonic major mode to occupy its own proud place
as the chief medium for the expression of the optimistic emotions.
Bach seldom tarried loner in major keys. He was lingering under
the influence of the ecclesiastic modes. Elgar has emancipated his
oratorio music from the domination of these modes, but he has not,
like Handel and Mendelssohn--the one governed by the Omphalic distaff
of Italian opera and the other writing in an age when the minor was
always relative--neglected their significance entirely.

Secondly, he has utilized the whole splendor of the modern orchestra
and has extended it in every direction which seemed to him necessary.
He has employed gongs, both great and small; cymbals ancient and
modern, bells with and without keyboard mechanism, tambourine and
triangle. Of course, he has written elaborately for the organ; he
would not be a loyal son of the royal house of Bach if he had not.

Thirdly, he has gone over, horse, foot, and baggage, to the
Wagnerian camp and armed himself from head to foot with leading
motives. In "The Apostles" there are ninety-two of them--just two
more than Hans von Wolzogen found in the whole of "Der Ring des
Nibelungen." The result is that there is almost no free composition
in the score; it is all woven out of the motives. The web thus woven
is sometimes thick, sometimes thin. Motives steal upon us singly or
crowd before us four at a time, writhing in a counterpoint, sometimes
forming most beautiful orchestral cloud shapes and again smearing
garish shades and monstrous outlines across the musical firmament.
Elgar never shrinks from outlandish combinations. He is as daring as
Strauss. He makes fearful ugliness when he wishes to do so. But he
does everything with a delineative purpose. He is the Wagnerite of
oratorio.

To Wagner's ingenious scheme of interweaving and developing leading
motives Elgar has joined the ground plan of polyphonic choral writing
which was the secret of the influence of Bach and Handel, but Elgar
has a palette with a thousand tone tints which they never knew. He
has all the delicate inner tracery of modern harmonization to throw
additional lights and shades upon his colors.

In a word, Elgar has brought together in his oratorios all
the expressional power of modern musical romanticism, whether
found in the descriptive tone pictures of the instrumentalists,
the declamation of the dramatists, or the orchestration of the
contemporaneous opera. What is the result? We have now oratorio quite
as dramatic as Tinel's, but saved from mere theatricalism by the
artistic discretion of the composer.

But the thing itself is anomalous. As we have noted, the narrator
becomes an imperative necessity, because oratorio now demands scenic
representation, and that is forbidden. How much more imposing would
"The Apostles" be if we would frankly go back to the way of Cavaliere
and put it on the stage! Why enact "Parsifal" and not this? Which is
the truer tale, the more convincing art? This "Apostles" reads like
that question-begging version of "Parsifal" as a narrative poem in
which all the stage directions are turned into descriptive verse.
Set those descriptions to music and have them recited by singers in
evening dress and you have your "Parsifal" in correct oratorio form.

Are we afraid of it? Or is it simply that certain good people
to whom the theatre is a place accursed must have their dramatic
excitements in some other form? Let us, if you will, go to a dimly
lighted concert hall and sit with our heads bent over our scores
while ladies and gentlemen, gloved and in evening dress, narrate
and chant to us a tremendous drama, helped out by all the resources
of modern delineative music, and we try to see the action with our
mind's eye. Thus shall we salve our consciences and perform the
tragedy of the Passion within the four walls of our skulls. This may
perchance insure to us that salvation which might be endangered were
we fearlessly to countenance an actual presentation of the drama on
the stage.

The oratorio of to-day tends steadily toward the completion of a
cycle. It started from the primitive religious play of Cavaliere, and
through the development of the method of choral composition reached a
point at which all conception of action disappeared. From that point
it has been slowly and surely moving around to the restoration of the
dramatic element, till now it stands once more at the very threshold
of the theatre. In its present form it is an absurdity. Even the
singers find it almost impossible to sing the oratorios of the new
sort without putting at least facial expression into their work,
and every one of them looks solemnly conscious of the foolishness
of evening dress. Mr. Elgar's interpretation makes Judas Iscariot
altogether too realistic for a white waistcoat, and his Mary Magdalen
in a Princess gown with kid-gloved arms is a portrait which would
make Henner gasp and Ruskin stare.

The chapters of this volume, except three, appeared originally as
articles in the NEW YORK SUN in the course of the two years during
which I have had the honor to serve that paper. The first half of the
chapter on "Strauss and the Song Writers" and the chapter entitled
"The Classic of the Unprogressive" were first printed in the NEW
YORK TIMES, of which it was my privilege to be musical editor for
some years. The first of the four articles on Richard Strauss was
previously published in the ATLANTIC MONTHLY. My thanks are due to
the proprietors and editors of the journals named for permission to
incorporate the essays in this book.

                         THE STORY OF MUSIC.

                         BY W. J. HENDERSON.

               _12mo, Ornamental Cloth Cover, $1.00._


"Mr. Henderson tells in a clear, comprehensive, and logical way the
story of the growth of modern music. The work is pre-fixed by a
newly-prepared chronological table, which will be found invaluable
by musical students, and which contains many dates and notes of
important events that are not further mentioned in the text.... Few
contemporary writers on music have a more agreeable style, and few,
even among the renowned and profound Germans, a firmer grasp of the
subject. The book, moreover, will be valuable to the student for
its references, which form a guide to the best literature of music
in all languages. The story of the development of religious music,
a subject that is too often made forbidding and uninteresting to
the general reader, is here related so simply as to interest and
instruct any reader, whether or not he has a thorough knowledge of
harmonics and an intimate acquaintance with the estimable dominant
and the deplorable consecutive fifths. The chapter on instruments and
instrumental forms is valuable for exactly the same reasons."--NEW
YORK TIMES.

"It is a pleasure to open a new book and discover on its first page
that the clearness and simple beauty of its typography has a harmony
in the clearness, directness, and restful finish of the writer's
style.... Mr. Henderson has accomplished, with rare judgment and
skill, the task of telling the story of the growth of the art of
music without encumbering his pages with excess of biographical
material. He has aimed at a connected recital, and, for its sake,
has treated of creative epochs and epoch-making works, rather than
groups of composers segregated by the accidents of time and space....
Admirable for its succinctness, clearness, and gracefulness of
statement."--NEW YORK TRIBUNE.

"The work is both statistical and narrative, and its special design
is to give a detailed and comprehensive history of the various steps
in the development of music as an art. There is a very valuable
chronological table, which presents important dates that could not
otherwise be well introduced into the book. The choice style in which
this book is written lends its added charms to a work most important
on the literary as well as on the artistic side of music."--BOSTON

                        PRELUDES AND STUDIES

                    _MUSICAL THEMES OF THE DAY._

                         BY W. J. HENDERSON,

                   Author of "The Story of Music."

               _12mo, Cloth, Extra, Gilt Top, $1.00._

"The questions which he handles are all living. Even the purely
histories lectures which he has grouped together under the general
head of "The Evolution of Piano Music," are informed with freshness
and contemporaneous interest by the manner which he has chosen for
their treatment.... The concluding chapter of the book is an essay
designed to win appreciation for Schumann, ... and is the gem of the
book both in thought and expression."--NEW YORK TRIBUNE.

"Leaving Wagner, of whom the book treats in a most interesting way,
the evolution of piano music is taken up and treated in such a way
as to convince one that the writer is a master of his subject. Mr.
Henderson dwells on the performances of some living players, their
methods, manner, etc., and closes his work with a number on Schumann
and the programme symphony."--DETROIT SUNDAY NEWS.

"The book is written by one who knows his subject thoroughly and is
made interesting to the general public as well as to those who are
learned in music.--BOSTON POST.

"All lovers and students of music will find much to
appreciate.... Mr. Henderson writes charmingly of his various
subjects--sympathetically critically, and keenly. He shows a sincere
love for his themes, and study of them; yet he is never pedantic, a
virtue to be appreciated in a writer of essays upon any department of
art."--BOSTON TIMES.

"Mr. Henderson's clear style is well known to readers of the musical
criticism of the New York Times, and his catholicity of sentiment,
and freedom from prejudice, ... though this volume will be especially
valuable to the student of music, it will be helpful to the amateur,
and can be read with satisfaction by one ignorant of music, which,
altogether, is surely high praise."--PROVIDENCE SUNDAY JOURNAL.

"It is a volume of extremely suggestive musical studies.... They are
all full of appreciative comment, and show considerable dear insight
into the origin and nature of musical works. The author has a style
which is adapted to exposition. The book is an attractive one for the
lover of music."--PUBLIC OPINION.

"Mr. Henderson studies carefully and intelligently the evolution
of piano music and Schumann's relation to the development of the
programme symphony. This is a suggestive, original, and well-equipped
group of essays upon themes which interest musicians."--LITERARY WORLD.

                               WAGNER

                           AS I KNEW HIM.

                        BY FERDINAND PRAEGER.

           _Crown 8vo, 858 Pages, Cloth, Gilt Top, $1.50._

"The late Ferdinand Praeger will live in the history of musical
biography as the author of the best book that has been written on
Wagner the man.... In this agreeable volume we get what may be
conceived to be the true Wagner, as seen by the eye of a friend who
was too fair to be a partisan. Certainly we know of no portrait
of the great musician so graphic and so enjoyable. The book is as
attractive as a good novel. What more can one say to recommend it
to the general reader? For 'Wagner as I Knew Him' is by no means
fitted only for the musical amateur. There is nothing professional
or technical about it. It is a volume which can be understood
and appreciated even by those who know little or nothing of
music."--GLOBE.

"The two chapters on Wagner's life in London are of especial
interest as showing the true character of the man; for, while in
London, Wagner spent much of his time with Praeger, who became a
sort of Boswell and host for the time, and minutely noted all his
peculiarities.... It is no depreciation of Praeger's efforts to say
that the most valuable pages in his book are those which contain
the numerous letters to him by Wagner, here printed for the first
time."--NATION, N. Y.

"A lively and thoroughly readable book, rich with personal
reminiscence and self-confessions of the modern Master of
Music."--CHRISTIAN UNION, N.Y.

"A lively delineation of the master as he appeared in daily life,
in friendly intercourse and correspondence, in domestic life, as
composer and conductor, as student and master, as revolutionist and
exile; it depicts him in his down settings and in his uprisings, in
his external appearance and in his inward thoughts and feelings. It
is full of interest from beginning to end, and of entertainment as
well. Of the latter quality, indeed, there are some most amusing
examples."--ÉTUDE, PHILADELPHIA.

"Really it is a biography, though it is not exactly in that form or
aimed at so ambitious a purpose, but it covers the whole of Wagner's
active life. We cannot speak too highly of it.... It is a remarkably
faithful story, presenting the composer's character and experiences
in vivid colors, and not failing to give the weak as well as the
strong side."--HERALD, BOSTON.

"A really valuable addition to the number of books about music and
musicians."--CRITIC, N. Y.

"It is easy to see that Mr. Praeger knew his subject well and was
fully competent to write about it."--CHICAGO TRIBUNE.

"The story of Wagner's life and labors is retold in this volume with
that added charm which comes from the pen of a writer personally
engaged in the action described. The account of Wagner's visit to
London, when he was Dr. Praeger's guest, is full of interest and
brings the man before the reader more picturesquely than any other
part of the book.... On the whole this volume is a valuable addition
to the already large library of Wagner literature."--N. Y. TIMES.

                           CHRISTIAN THAL.

                    THE STORY OF A MUSICAL LIFE.

              By M. E. FRANCIS (Mrs. FRANCIS BLUNDELL),

       AUTHOR OF "THE DUENNA OF A GENIUS," "MANOR FARM," ETC.

                          Crown 8vo, $1.50

" ... This year has seen several attempts to produce a real 'musical
novel.' That of Mrs. Francis is one of the best, it is a pretty story
and one which will give no little inspiration among students in the
reading.... In 'Christian Thal' the characters are such as we all
know and can well understand.... It is, although a musical novel,
very human."--MUSICAL LIFE, NEW YORK.

" ... We have seldom read anything more charming than are parts,
at least, of this picture of artistic, semi-Bohemian life in
Germany; she has caught the very spirit of it, she makes one
feel it all--the frank good-comradeship, the bubbling enthusiasm
for art, the childlike disregard for conventionalities. And the
characters are delightfully drawn, too, with delicate yet incisive
touches...."--COMMERCIAL ADVERTISER, NEW YORK.

" ... The temperament that goes with great artistic genius is well
displayed in the hero. As a story we are glad to say that the
interest steadily heightens to the end, and that the book contains
pathos, sentiment, humor, and the other characteristics demanded by a
readable work in fiction...."--THE ÉTUDE.

" ... It is nevertheless one of the most readable of Mrs. Francis
Blundell's (M. E. Francis') novels. It centers in musical circles,
in the love affair of a young musical genius, 'Christian Thal' of
foreign origin, and a young English girl whom he meets at a German
health resort.... This is a very good companion for one's resting
hours."--CHICAGO RECORD-HERALD.

"An interesting novel in which love, music, and human weakness,
and the waywardness of woman are strangely and cleverly blended.
Each chapter is headlined with a bar of music and the entire
story is keyed to respond to the musical theme. Dramatic and
absorbing."--PITTSBURGH CHRONICLE-TELEGRAPH.

" ... There is a fascination about the tale which will hold the
reader."--PICAYUNE, NEW ORLEANS.

" ... The book is as much saturated with the art musical as was that
delightful book 'Trilby' with the art pictorial Even the chapter
headings are excerpts from some well-remembered and well-beloved
master. It is a symphony in words with love for its theme,
beautifully ornamented with the harmony of emotion and has a finale
radiant with peace, goodness, and wedded love."--ARMY AND NAVY
REGISTER.

exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

PREFACE.


The following work was announced several years ago in the preface
to the volume on “The Sidereal Heavens;” since which time numerous
enquiries have been made after it by correspondents in England, the
West Indies, and America. It was nearly ready for publication three
years ago; but circumstances over which the Author had no controul,
prevented its appearance at that period. This delay, however, has
enabled him to introduce descriptions of certain instruments and
inventions which were partly unknown at the time to which he refers.

The title “Practical Astronomer” has been fixed upon, as the shortest
that could be selected, although the volume does not comprise a variety
of topics and discussions generally comprehended in this department of
astronomy. The work is intended for the information of general readers,
especially for those who have acquired a relish for astronomical
pursuits, and who wish to become acquainted with the instruments by
which celestial observations are made, and to apply their mechanical
skill to the construction of some of those which they may wish to
possess. With this view the Author has entered into a variety of minute
details, in reference to the construction and practical application
of all kinds of telescopes, &c. which are not to be found in general
treatises on Optics and Astronomy.

As _Light_ is the foundation of astronomical science, and of all the
instruments used for celestial observation, a brief description is
given of the general properties of light--of the laws by which it is
refracted and reflected when passing through different mediums--and of
the effects it produces in the system of nature--in order to prepare
the way for a clear understanding of the principles on which optical
instruments are constructed, and the effects they produce.

As this, as well as every other physical subject, forms a part of the
arrangements of the Creator throughout the material system--the Author
has occasionally taken an opportunity of directing the attention of
the reader to the Wisdom and Beneficence of the Great First Cause, and
of introducing those moral reflections which naturally flow from the
subject.

The present is the ninth volume which the Author has presented to
the public, and he indulges the hope that it will meet with the same
favourable reception which his former publications have uniformly
experienced. It was originally intended to conclude the volume with a
few remarks on the _utility_ of astronomical studies, and their _moral_
and _religious_ tendency, but this has been prevented, for the present,
in consequence of the work having swelled to a greater size than was
anticipated. Should he again appear before the public as an author, the
subject of discussion and illustration will have a more direct bearing
than the present on the great objects of religion and a future world.

_Broughty Ferry, near Dundee, August, 1845._

THE

PRACTICAL ASTRONOMER.




PART I.

ON LIGHT.


INTRODUCTION.

Light is that invisible etherial matter which renders objects
perceptible by the visual organs. It appears to be distributed
throughout the immensity of the universe, and is essentially requisite
to the enjoyment of every rank of perceptive existence. It is by
the agency of this mysterious substance, that we become acquainted
with the beauties and sublimities of the universe, and the wonderful
operations of the Almighty Creator. Without its universal influence,
an impenetrable veil would be thrown over the distant scenes of
creation; the sun, the moon, the planets, and the starry orbs, would
be shrouded in the deepest darkness, and the variegated surface of
the globe on which we dwell, would be almost unnoticed and unknown.
Creation would disappear, a mysterious gloom would surround the mind
of every intelligence, all around would appear a dismal waste, and an
undistinguished chaos. To whatever quarter we might turn, no form nor
comeliness would be seen, and scarcely a trace of the perfections and
agency of an All Wise and Almighty Being could be perceived throughout
the universal gloom. In short, without the influence of light, no world
could be inhabited, no animated being could subsist in the manner it
now does, no knowledge could be acquired of the works of God, and
happiness, even in the lowest degree, could scarcely be enjoyed by any
organized intelligence.

We have never yet known what it is to live in a world deprived of this
delightful visitant; for in the darkest night we enjoy a share of its
beneficial agency, and even in the deepest dungeon its influence is
not altogether unfelt.[1] The blind, indeed, do not directly enjoy
the advantages of light, but its influence is reflected upon them,
and their knowledge is promoted through the medium of those who enjoy
the use of their visual organs. Were all the inhabitants of the world
deprived of their eye-sight, neither knowledge nor happiness, such as
we now possess, could possibly be enjoyed.

There is nothing which so strikingly displays the beneficial and
enlivening effects of light, as the dawn of a mild morning after a
night of darkness and tempest. All appears gloom and desolation, in
our terrestrial abode, till a faint light begins to whiten the eastern
horizon. Every succeeding moment brings along with it something new
and enlivening. The crescent of light towards the east, now expands its
dimensions and rises upwards towards the cope of heaven; and objects,
which a little before were immersed in the deepest gloom, begin to be
clearly distinguished. At length the sun arises, and all nature is
animated by his appearance; the magnificent scene of creation, which
a little before was involved in obscurity, opens gradually to view,
and every object around excites sentiments of wonder, delight, and
adoration. The radiance which emanates from this luminary, displays
before us a world strewed with blessings and embellished with the most
beautiful attire. It unveils the lofty mountains and the forests with
which they are crowned--the fruitful fields with the crops that cover
them--the meadows, with the rivers which water and refresh them--the
plains adorned with verdure, the placid lake and the expansive ocean.
It removes the curtain of darkness from the abodes of men, and shows us
the cities, towns and villages, the lofty domes, the glittering spires,
and the palaces and temples with which the landscape is adorned. The
flowers expand their buds and put forth their colours, the birds awake
to melody, man goes forth to his labour, the sounds of human voices are
heard, and all appears life and activity, as if a new world had emerged
from the darkness of Chaos.

The whole of this splendid scene, which light produces, may be
considered as a new creation, no less grand and beneficent than the
first creation, when the command was issued, “Let there be light, and
light was.” The aurora and the rising sun cause the earth and all
the objects which adorn its surface, to arise out of that profound
darkness and apparent desolation which deprived us of the view of them,
as if they had been no more. It may be affirmed, in full accordance
with truth, that the efflux of light in the dawn of the morning, after
a dark and cloudy night, is even more magnificent and exhilarating
than at the first moment of its creation. At that period, there
were no spectators on earth to admire its glorious effects; and no
objects, such as we now behold, to be embellished with its radiance.
The earth was a shapeless chaos, where no beauty or order could be
perceived; the mountains had not reared their heads; the seas were not
collected into their channels; no rivers rolled through the valleys, no
verdure adorned the plains; the atmosphere was not raised on high to
reflect the radiance, and no animated beings existed to diversify and
enliven the scene. But now, when the dawning of the morning scatters
the darkness of the night, it opens to view a scene of beauty and
magnificence. The heavens are adorned with azure, the clouds are tinged
with the most lively colours, the mountains and plains are clothed with
verdure, and the whole of this lower creation stands forth arrayed with
diversified scenes of beneficence and grandeur, while the contemplative
eye looks round and wonders.

Such, then, are the important and beneficent effects of that _light_
which every moment diffuses its blessings around us. It may justly
be considered as one of the most essential substances connected with
the system of the material universe, and which gives efficiency to
all the other principles and arrangements of nature. Hence we are
informed, in the sacred history, that light was the first production
of the Almighty Creator, and the first born of created beings; for
without it the universe would have presented nothing but an immense
blank to all sentient existences. Hence, likewise, the Divine Being
is metaphorically represented under the idea of light, as being the
source of knowledge and felicity to all subordinate intelligences: “God
is _light_, and in Him is no darkness at all;” and he is exhibited as
“dwelling in light unapproachable and full of glory, whom no man hath
seen or can see.” In allusion to these circumstances, Milton, in his
Paradise Lost, introduces the following beautiful apostrophe:--

    ‘Hail holy light! offspring of heaven first born,
    Or of the eternal co-eternal beam!
    May I express thee unblam’d? since God is light,
    And never but in unapproached light
    Dwelt from eternity; dwelt then in thee,
    Bright effluence of bright essence increate.
    ----Before the sun
    Before the heavens thou wert, and at the voice
    Of God, as with a mantle, did’st invest
    The rising world of waters dark and deep
    Won from the void and formless infinite.’

As light is an element of so much importance and utility in the
system of nature, so we find that arrangements have been made for its
universal diffusion throughout all the worlds in the universe. The sun
is one of the principal sources of light to this earth on which we
dwell, and to all the other planetary bodies. And, in order that it may
be _equally_ distributed over every portion of the surfaces of these
globes, to suit the exigencies of their inhabitants, they are endowed
with a motion of rotation, by which every part of their surfaces is
alternately turned towards the source of light; and when one hemisphere
is deprived of the direct influence of the solar rays, its inhabitants
derive a portion of light from luminaries in more distant regions, and
have their views directed to other suns and systems dispersed, in
countless numbers, throughout the remote spaces of the universe. Around
several of the planets, satellites, or moons, have been arranged for
the purpose of throwing light on their surfaces in the absence of the
sun, while at the same time the primary planets themselves reflect an
effulgence of light upon their satellites. All the stars which our
unassisted vision can discern in the midnight sky, and the millions
more which the telescope alone enables us to descry, must be considered
as so many fountains of light, not merely to illuminate the voids of
immensity, but to irradiate with their beams surrounding worlds with
which they are more immediately connected, and to diffuse a general
lustre throughout the amplitudes of infinite space. And, therefore,
we have every reason to believe, that, could we fly, for thousands of
years, with the swiftness of a seraph, through the spaces of immensity,
we should never approach a region of absolute darkness, but should find
ourselves, every moment encompassed with the emanations of light, and
cheered with its benign influences. That Almighty Being who inhabiteth
immensity and “dwells in light inaccessible,” evidently appears to
have diffused light over the remotest spaces of his creation, and to
have thrown a radiance upon all the provinces of his wide and eternal
empire, so that every intellectual being, wherever existing, may feel
its beneficent effects, and be enabled, through its agency, to trace
his wonderful operations, and the glorious attributes with which he is
invested.

As the science of astronomy depends solely on the influence of light
upon the organ of vision, which is the most noble and extensive of
all our senses; and as the construction of telescopes and other
astronomical instruments is founded upon our knowledge of the
nature of light and the laws by which it operates--it is essentially
requisite, before proceeding to a description of such instruments, to
take a cursory view of its nature and properties, in so far as they
have been ascertained, and the effects it produces when obstructed by
certain bodies, or when passing through different mediums.




CHAPTER I.

GENERAL PROPERTIES OF LIGHT.


It is not my intention to discuss the subject of light in minute
detail--a subject which is of considerable extent, and which would
require a separate treatise to illustrate it in all its aspects and
bearings. All that I propose is to offer a few illustrations of
its general properties, and the laws by which it is refracted and
reflected, so as to prepare the way for explaining the nature and
construction of telescopes, and other optical instruments.

There is no branch of natural science more deserving of our study and
investigation than that which relates to light--whether we consider its
beautiful and extensive effects--the magnificence and grandeur of the
objects it unfolds to view--the numerous and diversified phenomena it
exhibits--the optical instruments which a knowledge of its properties
has enabled us to construct--or the daily advantages we derive, as
social beings, from its universal diffusion. If air, which serves as
the medium of sound, and the vehicle of speech, enables us to carry on
an interchange of thought and affection with our fellow-men; how much
more extensively is that intercourse increased by light, which presents
the images of our friends and other objects as it were immediately
before us, in all their interesting forms and aspects--the speaking
eye--the rosy cheeks--the benevolent smile, and the intellectual
forehead! The eye, more susceptible of multifarious impressions than
the other senses, ‘takes in at once the landscape of the world,’ and
enables us to distinguish, in a moment, the shapes and forms of all
its objects, their relative positions, the colours that adorn them,
their diversified aspect, and the motions by which they are transported
from one portion of space to another. Light, through the medium of the
eye, not only unfolds to us the persons of others, in all their minute
modifications and peculiarities, but exhibits us to ourselves. It
presents to our own vision a faithful portrait of our peculiar features
behind reflecting substances, without which property we should remain
entirely ignorant of those traits of countenance which characterize us
in the eyes of others.

But, what is the nature of this substance we call _light_, which thus
unfolds to us the scenes of creation? On this subject two leading
opinions have prevailed in the philosophical world. One of those
opinions is, that the whole sphere of the universe is filled with a
subtle matter, which receives from luminous bodies an agitation which
is incessantly continued, and which, by its vibratory motion, enables
us to perceive luminous bodies. According to this opinion, light may
be considered as analogous to sound, which is conveyed to the ear by
the vibratory motions of the air. This was the hypothesis of Descartes,
which was adopted, with some modifications, by the celebrated Euler,
Huygens, Franklin, and other philosophers, and has been admitted by
several scientific gentlemen of the present day. The other opinion is,
that light consists of the emission or emanation of the particles of
luminous bodies, thrown out incessantly on all sides, in consequence
of the continued agitation it experiences. This is the hypothesis of
the illustrious Newton, and has been most generally adopted by British
philosophers.

To the first hypothesis, it is objected that, if true, ‘light would
not only spread itself in a direct line, but its motion would be
transmitted in every direction like that of sound, and would convey
the impression of luminous bodies in the regions of space beyond the
obstacles that intervene to stop its progress.’ No wall or other opaque
body could obstruct its course, if it undulated in every direction like
sound; and it would be a necessary consequence, that we should have no
night, nor any such phenomena as eclipses of the sun or moon, or of
the satellites of Jupiter and Saturn. This objection has never been
very satisfactorily answered. On the other hand, Euler brings forward
the following objections against the Newtonian doctrine of emanation.
1. That, were the sun emitting continually, and in all directions,
such floods of luminous matter with a velocity so prodigious, he must
speedily be exhausted, or at least, some alteration must, after the
lapse of so many ages, be perceptible. 2. That the sun is not the only
body that emits rays, but that all the stars have the same quality; and
as every where the rays of the sun must be crossing the rays of the
stars, their collision must be violent in the extreme, and that their
direction must be changed by such a collision.[2]

To the first of these objections it is answered--that so vast is the
tenuity of light, that it utterly exceeds the power of conception:
the most delicate instrument having never been certainly put in
motion by the impulse of the accumulated sun-beams. It has been
calculated that in the space of 385,130,000 Egyptian years, (of 360
days,) the sun would lose only the 1/1,217,420th of his bulk from the
continual efflux of his light. And, therefore, if in 385 _millions_ of
years the sun’s diminution would be so extremely small, it would be
altogether insensible during the comparatively short period of five
or six thousand years. To the second objection it is replied--that
the particles of light are so extremely rare that their distance from
one another is incomparably greater than their diameters--that all
objections of this kind vanish when we attend to the continuation of
the impression upon the retina, and to the small number of luminous
particles which are on that account necessary for producing constant
vision. For it appears, from the accurate experiments of M. D’Arcy,
that the impression of light upon the retina continues _eight thirds_,
and as a particle of light would move through 26,000 miles in that
time, constant vision would be maintained by a succession of luminous
particles twenty-six thousand miles distant from each other.

Without attempting to decide on the merits of these two hypotheses, I
shall leave the reader to adopt that opinion which he may judge to be
attended with the fewest difficulties, and proceed to illustrate some
of the _properties of light_:--and in the discussion of this subject, I
shall generally adhere to the terms employed by those who have adopted
the hypothesis of the _emanation_ of light.

1. _Light emanates or radiates from luminous bodies in a straight
line._ This property is proved by the impossibility of seeing light
through bent tubes, or small holes pierced in metallic plates placed
one behind another, except the holes be placed in a straight line.
If we endeavour to look at the sun or a candle through the bore of a
bended pipe, we cannot perceive the object, nor any light proceeding
from it, but through a straight pipe the object may be perceived. This
is likewise evident from the form of the rays of light that penetrate
a dark room, which proceed straight forward in lines proceeding from
the luminous body; and from the form of the _shadows_ which bodies
project, which are bounded by right lines passing from the luminous
body, and meeting the lines which terminate the interposing body. This
property may be demonstrated to the eye, by causing light to pass
through small holes into a dark room filled with smoke or dust. It is
to be understood, however, that in this case, the rays of light are
considered as passing through the same medium; for when they pass from
air into water, glass, or other media, they are bent at the point where
they enter a different medium, as we shall afterwards have occasion to
explain.

2. _Light moves with amazing velocity._ The ancients believed
that it was propagated from the sun and other luminous bodies
_instantaneously_; but the observations of modern astronomers have
demonstrated that this is an erroneous hypothesis, and that light, like
other projectiles, occupies a certain time in passing from one part of
space to another. Its velocity, however, is prodigious, and exceeds
that of any other body with which we are acquainted. It flies across
the earth’s orbit--a space 190 millions of miles in extent, in the
course of sixteen and a half minutes, which is at the rate of 192,000
miles every second, and more than a million of times swifter than a
cannon ball flying with its greatest velocity. It appears from the
discoveries of Dr. Bradley, respecting the aberration of the stars,
that light flies from those bodies, with a velocity similar, if not
exactly the same; so that the light of the sun, the planets, the stars,
and every luminous body in the universe is propagated with _uniform_
velocity.[3] But, if the velocity of light be so very great, it may be
asked, how does it not strike against all objects with a force equal
to its velocity? If the finest sand were thrown against our bodies
with the hundredth part of this velocity, each grain would pierce us
as certainly as the sharpest and swiftest arrows from a bow. It is a
principle in mechanics that the force with which all bodies strike,
is in proportion to the size of these bodies, or the quantity of
matter they contain, multiplied by the velocity with which they move.
Therefore if the particles of light were not almost infinitely small,
they would, of necessity prove destructive in the highest degree. If a
particle of light were equal in size to the twelve hundred thousandth
part of a small grain of sand,--supposing light to be material--we
should be no more able to withstand its force than we should that of
sand shot point blank from the mouth of a cannon. Every object would
be battered and perforated by such celestial artillery, till our world
were laid in ruins, and every living being destroyed. And herein
are the wisdom and benevolence of the Creator displayed in making
the particles of light so extremely small as to render them in some
degree proportionate to the greatness of the force with which they are
impelled; otherwise, all nature would have been thrown into ruin and
confusion, and the great globes of the universe shattered to atoms.

We have many proofs, besides the above, that the particles of light are
next to infinitely small. We find that they penetrate with facility the
hardest substances, such as crystal, glass, various kinds of precious
stones, and even the diamond itself, though among the hardest of
stones; for such bodies could not be transparent, unless light found
an easy passage through their pores. When a candle is lighted in an
elevated situation, in the space of a second or two, it will fill a
cubical space (if there be no interruption) of two miles around it, in
every direction, with luminous particles, before the least sensible
part of its substance is lost by the candle:--that is, it will in a
short instant, fill a sphere four miles in diameter, twelve and a half
miles in circumference, and containing thirty-three and a half cubical
miles with particles of light; for an eye placed in any part of this
cubical space would perceive the light emitted by the candle. It has
been calculated that the number of particles of light contained in
such a space cannot be less than _four hundred septillions_--a number
which is _six billions_ of times greater than the number of grains of
sand which could be contained in the whole earth considered as a solid
globe, and supposing each cubic inch of it to contain ten hundred
thousand grains. Such is the inconceivable tenuity of that substance
which emanates from all luminous bodies, and which gives beauty and
splendour to the universe! This may also be evinced by the following
experiment. Make a small pin-hole in a piece of black paper, and hold
the paper upright facing a row of candles placed near each other, and
at a little distance behind the black paper, place a piece of white
pasteboard. On this pasteboard the rays which flow from all the candles
through the small hole in the black paper, will form as many specks
of light as there are candles, each speck being as clear and distinct
as if there were only one speck from a single candle. This experiment
shows that the streams of light from the different candles pass through
the small hole without confusion, and consequently, that the particles
of light are exceedingly small. For the same reason we can easily see
through a small hole not more than 1/100th of an inch in diameter, the
sky, the trees, houses, and nearly all the objects in an extensive
landscape, occupying nearly an entire hemisphere, the light of all
which may pass through this small aperture.

3. _Light is sent forth in all directions from every visible point
of luminous bodies._ If we hold a sheet of paper before a candle,
or the sun, or any other source of light, we shall find that the
paper is illuminated in whatever position we hold it, provided the
light is not obstructed by its edge or by any other body. Hence,
wherever a spectator is placed with regard to a luminous body,
every point of that part of its surface which is toward him will
be visible, when no intervening object intercepts the passage of
the light. Hence, likewise, it follows, that the sun illuminates,
not only an immense plane extending along the paths of the planets,
from the one side of the orbit of Uranus to the other, but the whole
of that sphere, or solid space, of which the distance of Uranus
is the radius. The diameter of this sphere is three thousand six
hundred _millions_ of miles, and it, consequently, contains about
24,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000, or twenty-four thousand
_quartillions_ of cubical miles,--every point of which immense space
is filled with the solar beams. Not only so, but the whole cubical
space which intervenes between the sun and the nearest fixed stars
is more or less illuminated by his rays. For, at the distance of
Sirius, or any other of the nearest stars, the sun would be visible,
though only as a small twinkling orb; and consequently, his rays
must be diffused, however faint, throughout the most distant spaces
whence he is visible. The diameter of this immense sphere of light
cannot be less than _forty billions_ of miles, and its solid contents
33,500,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 or, thirty-three
thousand, five hundred _sextillions_ of cubical miles. All this
immense, and incomprehensible space is filled with the radiations of
the solar orb; for were an eye placed in any one point of it, where
no extraneous body interposed, the sun would be visible either as a
large luminous orb, or as a small twinkling star. But he can be visible
only by the rays he emits, and which enter the organs of vision. How
inconceivably immense, then, must be the quantity of rays which are
thrown off in all directions from that luminary which is the source of
our day! Every star must likewise be considered as emitting innumerable
streams of radiance over a space equally extensive, so that no point in
the universe can be conceived where absolute darkness prevails, unless
in the _interior_ regions of planetary bodies.

4. _The effect of light upon the eye is not instantaneous, but
continues for a short space of time._ This may be proved and
illustrated by the following examples:--If a stick--or a ball
connected with a string--be whirled round in a circle, and a certain
degree of velocity given it, the object will appear to fill the whole
circle it describes. If a lighted firebrand be whirled round in the
same rapid manner, a complete circle of light will be exhibited.
This experiment obviously shows that the impression made on the
eye by the light from the ball or the firebrand--when in any given
point of the circle--is sufficiently lasting to remain till it has
described the whole circle, and again renews its effect, as often as
the circular motion is continued. The same is proved by the following
considerations:--We are continually shutting our eyes, _or winking_;
and, during the time our eyes are shut, on such occasions, we should
lose the view of surrounding objects, if the impression of light did
not continue a certain time while the eye-lid covers the pupil; but
experience proves that during such vibrations of the eye-lids, the
light from surrounding objects is not sensibly intercepted. If we look
for some time steadily at the light of a candle, and particularly, if
we look directly at the sun, without any interposing medium, or if we
look for any considerable time at this luminary, through a telescope
with a coloured glass interposed--in all these cases, if we shut our
eyes immediately after viewing such objects, we shall still perceive a
faint image of the object, by the impression which its light has made
upon our eyes.

‘With respect to the _duration_ of the impression of light, it has been
observed that the teeth of a cog-wheel in a clock were still visible
in succession, when the velocity of rotation brought 246 teeth through
a given fixed point in a second. In this case it is clear that if the
impression made on the eye by the light reflected from any tooth, had
lasted without sensible diminution for the 246th part of a second, the
teeth would have formed one unbroken line, because a new tooth would
have continually arrived in the place of the interior one before its
image could have disappeared. If a live coal be whirled round, it is
observed that the luminous circle is complete, when the rotation is
performed in the (8-1/2)/60th of a second. In this instance we see
that the impression was much more durable than the former. Lastly, if
an observer sitting in a room direct his sight through a window, to
any particular object out of doors, for about half a minute, and then
shut his eyes and cover them with his hands, he will still continue to
see the window, together with the outline of the terrestrial objects
bordering on the sky. This appearance will remain for near a minute,
though occasionally vanishing and changing colour in a manner that
brevity forbids our minutely describing. From these facts we are
authorized to conclude, that all impressions of light on the eye, last
a considerable time, that the brightest objects make the most lasting
impressions; and that, if the object be very bright, or the eye weak,
the impression may remain for a time so strong, as to mix with and
confuse the subsequent impressions made by other objects. In the last
case the eye is said to be _dazzled_ by the light.’[4]

The following experiment has likewise been suggested as a proof of the
impression which light makes upon the eye. If a card, on both sides of
which a figure is drawn, for example, a bird and a cage, be made to
revolve rapidly on the straight line which divides it symmetrically,
the eye will perceive both figures at the same time, provided they
return successively to the same place. M. D’Arcy found by various
experiments, that, in general, the impression which light produces on
the eye, lasts about _the eighth of a second_. M. Plateau, of Brussels,
found that the impression of different colours lasted the following
periods; the numbers here stated being the decimal parts of a _second_.
_Flame_, 0.242. or nearly one fourth of a second; _Burning coal_,
0.229; _White_, 0.182, or, a little more than one sixth of a second;
_Blue_, 0.186; _Yellow_, 0.173; _Red_, 0.184.

5. _Light_, though extremely minute, _is supposed to have a certain
degree of force or momentum_. In order to prove this, the late
ingenious Mr. Mitchell contrived the following experiment. He
constructed a small vane in the form of a common weather-cock, of a
_very thin_ plate of copper, about an inch square, and attached to
one of the finest harpsicord wires, about ten inches long, and nicely
balanced at the other end of the wire, by a grain of very small shot.
The instrument had also fixed to it in the middle, at right angles to
the length of the wire, and in an horizontal direction, a small bit
of a very slender sewing needle, about half an inch long, which was
made magnetical. In this state the whole instrument might weigh about
ten grains. The vane was supported in the manner of the needle in the
mariner’s compass, so that it could turn with the greatest ease; and
to prevent its being affected by the vibrations of the air, it was
enclosed in a glass case or box. The rays of the sun were then thrown
upon the broad part of the vane or copper plate, from a concave mirror
of about two feet diameter, which, passing through the front glass of
the box, were collected into the focus of the mirror upon the copper
plate. In consequence of this the plate began to move with a slow
motion of about an inch in a second of time, till it had moved through
a space of about two inches and a half, when it struck against the
back of the box. The mirror being removed, the instrument returned to
its former situation, and the rays of the sun being again thrown upon
it, it again began to move, and struck against the back of the box as
before. This was repeated three or four times with the same success.

On the above experiment, the following calculation has been founded:
If we impute the motion produced in this experiment to the impulse of
the rays of light, and suppose that the instrument weighed ten grains,
and acquired a velocity of one inch in a second, we shall find that the
quantity of matter contained in the rays falling upon the instrument in
that time amounted to no more than one twelve hundred-millionth part
of a grain, the velocity of light exceeding the velocity of one inch
in a second in the proportion of about 12,000,000,000 to 1. The light
in this experiment was collected from a surface of about three square
feet, which reflecting only about half what falls upon it, the quantity
of matter contained in the rays of the sun incident upon a foot and a
half of surface in one second of time, ought to be no more than the
twelve hundred-millionth part of a grain. But the density of the rays
of light at the surface of the sun is greater than that at the earth
in the proportion of 45,000 to 1; there ought therefore to issue from
one square foot of the sun’s surface in one second of time, in order to
supply the waste by light 1/45,000th part of a grain of matter, that
is, a little more than two grains a day, or about 4,752,000 grains, or
670 pounds avoirdupoise, nearly, in 6,000 years, a quantity which would
have shortened the sun’s diameter no more than about ten feet, if it
were formed of the density of water only.

If the above experiment be considered as having been accurately
performed, and if the calculations founded upon it be correct, it
appears that there can be no grounds for apprehension that the sun can
ever be sensibly diminished by the immense and incessant radiations
proceeding from his body on the supposition that light is a material
emanation. For the diameter of the sun is no less than 880,000 miles;
and, before this diameter could be shortened, by the emission of
light, one English mile, it would require three millions, one hundred
and sixty-eight thousand years, at the rate now stated; and, before
it could be shortened ten miles, it would require a period of above
thirty-one millions of years. And although the sun were thus actually
diminished, it would produce no sensible effect or derangement
throughout the planetary system. We have no reason to believe that
the system, _in its present state and arrangements_, was intended to
endure for ever, and before that luminary could be so far reduced,
during the revolutions of eternity, as to produce any irregularities
in the system, new arrangements and modifications might be introduced
by the hand of the All Wise and Omnipotent Creator. Besides, it is not
improbable that a system of means is established by which the sun and
all the luminaries in the universe receive back again a portion of the
light which they are continually emitting, either from the planets from
whose surfaces it is reflected, or from the millions of stars whose
rays are continually traversing the immense spaces of creation, or
from some other sources to us unknown.

6. _The intensity of light is diminished in proportion to the square
of the distance from the luminous body._ Thus, a person at two feet
distance from a candle, has only the fourth part of the light he would
have at one foot, at three feet distance the ninth part, at four feet
the sixteenth part, at five feet the twenty fifth part, and so on for
other distances. Hence the light received by the planets of the Solar
system decreases in proportion to the squares of the distances of these
bodies from the sun. This may be illustrated by the following figure,

[Illustration: _Figure 1._]

Suppose the light which flows from a point A, and passes through a
square hole B, is received upon a plane C, parallel to the plane of the
hole--or, let the figure C be considered as the shadow of the plane B.
When the distance of C is double of B, the length and breadth of the
shadow C will be each double of the length and breadth of the plane B,
and treble when AD is treble of AB, and so on, which may be easily
examined by the light of a candle placed at A. Therefore the surface of
the shadow C, at the distance AC--double of AB, is divisible into four
squares, and at a treble distance, into nine squares, severally equal
to the square B, as represented in the figure. The light, then, which
falls upon the plane B being suffered to pass to double that distance,
will be uniformly spread over four times the space, and consequently
will be four times thinner in every part of that space. And at a treble
distance it will be nine times thinner, and at a quadruple distance
sixteen times thinner than it was at first. Consequently the quantities
of this rarified light received upon a surface of any given size and
shape when removed successively to these several distances, will be but
one-fourth, one-ninth, one-sixteenth, of the whole quantity received by
it at the first distance AB.

In conformity with this law, the relative quantities of light on the
surfaces of the planets may be easily determined, when their distances
from the sun are known. Thus, the distance of Uranus from the sun is
1,800,000,000 miles, which is about nineteen times greater than the
distance of the earth from the same luminary. The square of 19 is 361;
consequently the earth enjoys 361 times the intensity of light when
compared with that of Uranus; in other words, this distant planet
enjoys only the 1/361 part of the quantity of light which falls upon
the earth. This quantity, however, is equivalent to the light we should
enjoy from the combined effulgence of 348 full moons; and if the
pupils of the eyes of the inhabitants of this planet be much larger
than ours, and the _retina_ of the eye be endued with a much greater
degree of nervous sensibility, they may perceive objects with as great
a degree of splendour as we perceive on the objects which surround
us in this world. Following out the same principle, we find that the
quantity of light enjoyed by the planet Mercury is nearly _seven_ times
greater than that of the Earth, and that of Venus nearly _double_ of
what we enjoy--that Mars has less than the one half--Jupiter the _one
twenty-seventh_ part--and Saturn only the _one ninetieth_ part of the
light which falls upon the Earth. That the light of these distant
planets, however, is not so weak as we might at first imagine appears
from the brilliancy they exhibit, when viewed in our nocturnal sky,
either with the telescope or with the unassisted eye--and likewise from
the circumstance that a very small portion of the Sun--such as the one
fortieth or one fiftieth part diffuses a quantity of light sufficient
for most of the purposes of life, as is found in the case of total
eclipses of the Sun, when his western limb begins to be visible, only
like a fine luminous thread, for his light is then sufficient to render
distinctly visible all the parts of the surrounding landscape.

7. _It is by light reflected from opake bodies that most of the objects
around us are rendered visible._ When a lighted candle is brought
into a dark room, not only the candle but all other bodies in the
room become visible. Rays of the sun passing into a dark room render
luminous a sheet of paper on which they fall, and this sheet in its
turn enlightens, to a certain extent, the whole apartment, and renders
objects in it visible, so long as it receives the rays of the sun. In
like manner, the moon and the planets are opake bodies, but the light
of the sun falling upon them, and being reflected from their surfaces,
renders them visible. Were no light to fall on them from the sun, or
were they not endued with a power of reflecting it, they would be
altogether invisible to our sight. When the moon comes between us and
the sun, as in a total eclipse of that luminary, as no solar light is
reflected from the surface next the earth, she is invisible--only the
curve or outline of her figure being distinguished by her shadow. In
this case, however, there is a certain portion of reflected light on
the lunar hemisphere next the earth, though not distinguishable during
a solar eclipse. The earth is enlightened by the sun, and a portion of
the rays which fall upon it is reflected upon the dark hemisphere of
the moon which is then towards the earth. This reflected light from the
earth is distinctly perceptible, when the moon appears as a slender
crescent, two or three days after new moon--when the earth reflects its
light back on the moon, in the same manner as the full moon reflects
her light on the earth. Hence, even at this period of the moon, her
whole face becomes visible to us, but its light is not uniform or of
equal intensity. The thin crescent on which the full blaze of the solar
light falls, is very brilliant and distinctly seen, while the other
part, on which falls only a comparatively feeble light from the earth,
appears very faint, and is little more than visible to the naked eye,
but with a telescope of moderate power,--if the atmosphere be very
clear--it appears beautifully distinct, so that the relative positions
of many of the lunar spots may be distinguished.

The intensity of reflected light is very small, when compared with
that which proceeds directly from luminous bodies. M. Bouguer, a
French philosopher, who made a variety of experiments to ascertain the
proportion of light emitted by the heavenly bodies, concluded from
these experiments, that the light transmitted from the sun to the
earth is at least 300,000 times as great as that which descends to us
from the full moon--and that, of 300,000 rays which the moon receives,
from 170,000 to 200,000 are absorbed. Hence we find that, however
brilliant the moon may appear at night--in the day time she appears as
obscure as a small portion of dusky cloud to which she happens to be
adjacent, and reflects no more light than a portion of whitish cloud of
the same size. And as the full moon fills only the ninety thousandth
part of the sky, it would require at least ninety thousand moons to
produce as much light as we enjoy in the day-time under a cloudy sky.

As the moon and the planets are rendered visible to us only by light
reflected from their surfaces, so it is in the same way that the images
of most of the objects around us are conveyed to our organs of vision.
We behold all the objects which compose an extensive landscape,--the
hills and vales, the woods and lawns, the lakes and rivers, and the
habitations of man--in consequence of the capacity with which they
are endued of sending forth reflected rays to the eye, from every
point of their surfaces and in all directions. In connection with the
reflection of light, the following curious observation may be stated.
Baron Funk, visiting some silver mines in Sweden, observed, that,
‘in a clear day, it was as dark as pitch underground in the eye of a
pit, at sixty or seventy fathoms deep; whereas, in a cloudy or rainy
day, he could see to read even at 106 fathoms deep. Enquiring of the
miners, he was informed that this is always the case; and reflecting
upon it, he imagined it arose from this circumstance, that when the
atmosphere is full of clouds, light is reflected from them into the
pit in all directions, and that thereby a considerable proportion of
the rays are reflected perpendicularly upon the earth: whereas when the
atmosphere is clear, there are no opaque bodies to reflect the light in
this manner, at least in a sufficient quantity; and rays from the sun
himself can never fall perpendicularly in that country.’--The reason
here assigned is, in all probability, the true cause of the phenomenon
now described.

8. It is supposed by some philosophers that _light is subject to the
same laws of attraction that govern all other material substances_--and
that _it is imbibed and forms a constituent part of certain bodies_.
This has been inferred from the phenomena of the _Bolognian stone_, and
what are generally called the _solar phosphori_. The Bolognian stone
was first discovered about the year 1680, by Leascariolo, a shoe-maker
of Bologna. Having collected together some stones of a shining
appearance at the bottom of Monte Paterno, and being in quest of some
alchemical secret, he put them into a crucible to calcine them--that
is, to reduce them to the state of cinders. Having taken them out of
the crucible, and exposed them to the light of the sun, he afterwards
happened to carry them into a dark place, when to his surprise, he
observed that they possessed a self-illuminating power, and continued
to emit faint rays of light for some hours afterwards. In consequence
of this discovery, the Bolognian spar came into considerable demand
among natural philosophers and the curious in general; and the best
way of preparing it seems to have been hit upon by the family of
Zagoni, who supplied all Europe with Bolognian phosphorus, till the
discovery of more powerful phosphoric substances put an end to their
monopoly.--In the year 1677, Baldwin, a native of Misnia, observed
that chalk dissolved in aqua-fortis exactly resembled the Bolognian
stone in its property of imbibing light, and emitting it after it was
brought into the dark ; and hence it has obtained the name of Baldwin’s
phosphorus.

In 1730 M. du Fay directed his attention to this subject, and observed
that all earthy substances susceptible of calcination, either by
mere fire, or when assisted by the previous action of nitrous acid,
possessed the property of becoming more or less luminous, when calcined
and exposed for a short time in the light--that the most perfect of
these phosphori were limestones, and other kinds of carbonated lime,
gypsum, and particularly the topaz, and that some diamonds were also
observed to be luminous by simple exposure to the sun’s rays. Sometime
afterwards, Beccaria discovered that a great variety of other bodies
were convertible into phosphori by exposure to the mere light of the
sun, such as, organic animal remains, most compound salts, nitre and
borax--all the farinaceous and oily seeds of vegetable substances,
all the gums and several of the resins--the white woods and vegetable
fibre, either in the form of paper or linen; also starch and loaf-sugar
proved to be good phosphori, after being made thoroughly dry, and
exposed to the direct rays of the sun. Certain animal substances by
a similar treatment were also converted into phosphori; particularly
bone, sinew, glue, hair, horn, hoof, feathers, and fish-shells. The
same property was communicated to rock crystal and some other of
the gems, by rubbing them against each other so as to roughen their
surfaces, and then placing them for some minutes in the focus of a
lens, by which the rays of light were concentrated upon them, at the
same time that they were also moderately heated.

In the year 1768 Mr. Canton contributed some important facts in
relation to solar phosphori, and communicated a method of preparing
a very powerful one, which, after the inventor, is usually called
_Canton’s phosphorus_. He affirms that his phosphorus, enclosed in a
glass flask, and hermetically sealed, retains its property of becoming
luminous for at least four years, without any apparent decrease of
activity. It has also been found that, if a common box smoothing-iron,
heated in the usual manner, be placed for half a minute on a sheet
of dry, white paper, and the paper be then exposed to the light, and
afterwards examined in a dark closet, it will be found that the whole
paper will be luminous, that part, however, on which the iron had stood
being much more shining than the rest.

From the above facts it would seem that certain bodies have the power
of imbibing light and again emitting it, in certain circumstances,
and that this power may remain for a considerable length of time. It
is observed that the light which such bodies emit bears an analogy to
that which they have imbibed. In general, the illuminated phosphorus is
reddish; but when a weak light only has been admitted to it, or when
it has been received through pieces of white paper, the emitted light
is pale or whitish.--Mr. Morgan, in the seventy-fifth volume of the
Philosophical Transactions, treats the subject of light at considerable
length; and as a foundation for his reasoning, he assumes the following
data:--1. That light is a body, and like all others, subject to the
laws of attraction. 2. That light is a heterogeneous body; and that
the same attractive power operates with different degrees of force
on its different parts. To the principle of attraction, likewise,
Sir Isaac Newton has referred the most extraordinary phenomena of
light, Refraction and Inflection. He has also endeavoured to show that
light is not only subject to the law of attraction but of repulsion
also, since it is repelled or reflected from certain bodies. If
such principles be admitted, then, it is highly probable that the
phosphorescent bodies to which we have adverted have a power of
attracting or imbibing the substance of light, and of retaining or
giving it out under certain circumstances, and that the matter of light
is incorporated at least with the surface of such bodies. But on this
subject, as on many others, there is a difference of opinion among
philosophers.[5]

9. _Light is found to produce a remarkable effect on Plants and
Flowers, and other vegetable productions._ Of all the phenomena which
living vegetables exhibit there are few that appear more extraordinary
than the energy and constancy with which their stems incline toward the
light. Most of the discous flowers follow the sun in his course. They
attend him to his evening retreat, and meet his rising lustre in the
morning with the same unerring law. They unfold their flowers on the
approach of this luminary; they follow his course by turning on their
stems, and close them as soon as he disappears. If a plant, also, is
shut up in a dark room, and a small hole afterwards opened by which the
light of the sun may enter, the plant will turn towards that hole, and
even alter its own shape in order to get near it; so that though it
was straight before, it will in time become crooked, that it may get
near the light. Vegetables placed in rooms where they receive light
only in one direction, always extend themselves in that direction. If
they receive light in two directions, they direct their course towards
that which is strongest. It is not the _heat_ but the _light_ of the
sun which the plant thus covets; for, though a fire be kept in the
room, capable of giving a much stronger heat than the sun, the plant
will turn away from the fire in order to enjoy the solar light. Trees
growing in thick forests, where they only receive light from above,
direct their shoots almost invariably upwards, and therefore become
much taller and less spreading than such as stand single.

The _green_ colour of plants is likewise found to depend on the sun’s
light being allowed to shine on them; for without the influence of
the solar light, they are always of a _white_ colour. It is found by
experiment that, if a plant which has been reared in darkness be
exposed to the light of day, in two or three days it will acquire a
green colour perceptibly similar to that of plants which have grown
in open day-light. If we expose to the light one part of the plant,
whether leaf or branch, this part alone will become green. If we cover
any part of a leaf with an opake substance, this place will remain
white, while the rest becomes green. The whiteness of the inner leaves
of cabbages is a partial effect of the same cause, and many other
examples of the same kind might easily be produced. M. Decandolle,
who seems to have paid particular attention to this subject, has the
following remarks: ‘It is certain, that between the white state of
plants vegetating in darkness, and complete verdure, every possible
intermediate degree exists, determined by the intensity of the light.
Of this any one may easily satisfy himself by attending to the colour
of a plant exposed to the full day-light; it exhibits in succession
all the degrees of verdure. I had already seen the same phenomenon,
in a particular manner, by exposing plants reared in darkness to the
light of lamps. In these experiments, I not only saw the colour come on
gradually, according to the continuance of the exposure to light; but
I satisfied myself, that a certain intensity of permanent light never
gives to a plant more than a certain degree of colour. The same fact
readily shows itself in nature, when we examine the plants that grow
under shelter or in forests, or when we examine in succession the state
of the leaves that form the heads of cabbages.’[6]

It is likewise found that the _perspiration_ of vegetables is increased
or diminished, in a certain measure by the degree of _light_ which
falls upon them. The experiments of Mr. P. Miller and others, prove
that plants uniformly perspire most in the forenoon, though the
temperature of the air in which they are placed should be unvaried.
M. Guettard likewise informs us that a plant exposed to the rays of
the sun, has its perspiration increased to a much greater degree than
if it had been exposed to the same heat under the shade. Vegetables
are likewise found to be indebted to light for their smell, taste,
combustibility, maturity, and the resinous principle, which equally
depend upon this fluid. The aromatic substances, resins, and volatile
oil are the productions of southern climates, where the light is more
pure, constant, and intense. In fine, another remarkable property of
light on the vegetable kingdom is that, when vegetables are exposed to
open day-light, or to the sun’s rays, they emit oxygen gas or vital
air. It has been proved that, in the production of this effect, the
sun does not act as a body that heats. The emission of the gas is
determined by the light: pure air is therefore separated by the action
of light, and the operation is stronger as the light is more vivid.
By this continual emission of vital air, the Almighty incessantly
purifies the atmosphere, and repairs the loss of pure air occasioned by
respiration, combustion, fermentation, putrefaction, and numerous other
processes which have a tendency to contaminate this fluid so essential
to the vigor and comfort of animal life; so that, in this way, by the
agency of light, a due equilibrium is always maintained between the
constituent parts of the atmosphere.

In connection with this subject the following curious phenomenon may
be stated, as related by M. Haggern, a Lecturer on Natural History in
Sweden. One evening he perceived a faint flash of light repeatedly
dart from a marigold. Surprised at such an uncommon appearance, he
resolved to examine it with attention; and, to be assured it was no
deception of the eye, he placed a man near him, with orders to make
a signal at the moment when he observed the light. They both saw
it constantly at the same moment. The light was most brilliant on
marigolds of an orange or flame colour, but scarcely visible on pale
ones. The flash was frequently seen on the same flower two or three
times in quick succession; but more commonly at intervals of several
minutes; and when several flowers in the same place emitted their
light together, it could be observed at a considerable distance. The
phenomenon was remarked in the months of July and August at sun-set,
and for half an hour when the atmosphere was clear; but after a
rainy day, or when the air was loaded with vapours, nothing of it
was seen. The following flowers emitted flashes more or less vivid,
in this order:--1. The Marigold, 2. Monk’s hood, 3. The Orange Lily,
4. The Indian Pink. As to the _cause_ of this phenomenon, different
opinions may be entertained. From the rapidity of the flash and other
circumstances, it may be conjectured that electricity is concerned in
producing this appearance. M. Haggern, after having observed the flash
from the orange lily, the antheræ of which are at considerable distance
from the petals, found that the light proceeded from the petals only;
whence he concludes, that this electrical light is caused by the pollen
which, in flying off, is scattered on the petals. But, perhaps, the
true cause of it still remains to be ascertained.

10. _Light has been supposed to produce a certain degree of influence
on the_ PROPAGATION OF SOUND?--M. Parolette, in a long
paper in the ‘Journal de Physique,’ vol. 68, which is copied into
‘Nicholson’s Philosophical Journal,’ vol. 25, pp. 28-39,--has offered
a variety of remarks, and detailed a number of experiments on this
subject. The author states the following circumstances as having
suggested the connection between light and sound. ‘In 1803, I lived
in Paris, and being accustomed to rise before day to finish a work on
which I had long been employed, I found myself frequently disturbed
by the sound of carriages, as my windows looked into one of the most
frequented streets in that city. This circumstance which disturbed me
in my studies every morning, led me to remark, that the appearance of
day-break peculiarly affected the propagation of the sound: from dull
and deep, which it was before day, it seemed to me to acquire a more
sonorous sharpness in the period that succeeded the dissipation of
darkness. The rolling of the wheels seemed to announce the friction
of some substances grown more elastic; and my ear on attending to it
perceived this difference diminish, in proportion as the sound of
wheels was confounded with those excited by the tumult of objects
quitting their nocturnal silence. Struck with this observation, I
attempted to discover whether any particular causes had deceived my
ears. I rose several times before day for this purpose alone, and was
every time confirmed in my suspicion, that light must have a peculiar
influence on the propagation of sound. This variation, however, in
the manner in which the air gave sounds might be the effect of the
agitation of the atmosphere produced by the rarefaction the presence
of the sun occasioned; but the situation of my windows, and the usual
direction of the morning breeze, militated against this argument.’

The author then proceeds to give a description of a very delicate
instrument, and various apparatus for measuring the propagation and
intensity of sound, and the various experiments both in the dark, and
in day-light, and likewise under different changes of the atmosphere,
which were made with his apparatus--all of which tended to prove
that light had a sensible influence in the propagation of sound. But
the detail of these experiments and their several results would be
too tedious to be here transcribed.--The night has generally been
considered as more favourable than the day for the transmission of
sound. ‘That this is the case (says Parolette) with respect to our ears
cannot be doubted; but this argues nothing against my opinion. We hear
further by night on account of the silence, and this always contributes
to it, while the noise of a wind favourable to the propagation of a
sound, may prevent the sound from being heard.’ In reference to the
cause which produces the effect now stated, he proposes the following
queries. ‘Is the atmospheric air more dense on the appearance of light
than in darkness? Is this greater density of the air or of the elastic
fluid that is subservient to the propagation of sound, the effect of
aeriform substances kept in this state through the medium of light?’
He is disposed, on the whole, to conclude, that the effect in question
is owing to the action of light upon the oxygen of the atmosphere,
since oxygen gas is found by experiment to be best adapted to the
transmission of sound.

Our author concludes his communication with the following
remarks:--‘Light has a velocity 900,000 times as rapid as that of
sound. Whether it emanate from the sun and reach to our earth, or
act by means of vibrations agitating the particles of a fluid of a
peculiar nature--the particles of this fluid must be extremely light,
elastic and active. Nor does it appear to me unreasonable, to ascribe
to the mechanical action of these particles set in motion by the sun,
the effects its presence occasions in the vibrations that proceed from
sonorous bodies. The more deeply we investigate the theory of light,
the more we must perceive, that the powers by which the universe is
moved reside in the imperceptible particles of bodies; and that the
grand results of nature are but an assemblage of an order of actions
that take place in its infinitely small parts; consequently, we cannot
institute a series of experiments more interesting than those which
tend to develope the properties of light. Our organs of sense are so
immediately connected with the fluid that enlightens us, that the
notion of having acquired an idea of the mode of action of this fluid
presents itself to our minds, as the hope of a striking advance in
the knowledge of what composes the organic mechanism of our life, and
of that of beings which closely follow the rank assigned to the human
species.’

       *       *       *       *       *

Such is a brief description of some of the leading properties of light.
Of all the objects that present themselves to the philosophic and
contemplative mind, light is one of the noblest and most interesting.
The action it exerts on all the combinations of matter, its extreme
divisibility, the rapidity of its propagation, the sublime wonders it
reveals, and the office it performs in what constitutes the life of
organic beings, lead us to consider it as a substance acting the first
part in the economy of nature. The magic power which this emanation
from the heavens exerts on our organs of vision, in exhibiting to our
view the sublime spectacle of the universe, cannot be sufficiently
admired. Nor is its power confined to the organs of sight; all our
senses are, in a greater or less degree, subjected to the action of
light, and all the objects in this lower creation--whether in the
animal, the vegetable, or the mineral kingdoms--are, to a certain
extent, susceptible of its influence. Our globe appears to be little
more than an accumulation of terrestrial materials introduced into the
boundless ocean of the _solar light_, as a theatre on which it may
display its exhaustless power and energy, and give animation, beauty
and sublimity to every surrounding scene--and to regulate all the
powers of nature, and render them subservient to the purposes for which
they were ordained. This elementary substance appears to be universal
in its movements, and in its influence. It descends to us from the
solar orb. It wings its way through the voids of space, along a course
of ninety-five millions of miles, till it arrives at the outskirts of
our globe; it passes freely through the surrounding atmosphere, it
strikes upon the clouds and is reflected by them; it irradiates the
mountains, the vales, the forests, the rivers, the seas, and all the
productions of the vegetable kingdom, and adorns them with a countless
assemblage of colours. It scatters and disperses its rays from one end
of creation to another, diffusing itself throughout every sphere of the
universe. It flies without intermission from star to star, and from
suns to planets, throughout the boundless sphere of immensity, forming
a connecting chain and a medium of communication among all the worlds
and beings within the wide empire of Omnipotence.

When the sun is said “to rule over the day,” it is intimated that he
acts as the vicegerent of the Almighty, who has invested him with a
mechanical power of giving light, life and motion to all the beings
susceptible of receiving impressions from his radiance. As the servant
of his creator he distributes blessings without number among all the
tribes of sentient and intelligent existence. When his rays illumine
the eastern sky in the morning, all nature is enlivened with his
presence. When he sinks beneath the western horizon, the flowers droop,
the birds retire to their nests, and a mantle of darkness is spread
over the landscape of the world. When he approaches the equinox in
spring, the animal and vegetable tribes revive, and nature puts on a
new and a smiling aspect. When he declines towards the winter solstice,
dreariness and desolation ensue, and a temporary death takes place
among the tribes of the vegetable world.--This splendid luminary,
whose light embellishes the whole of this lower creation, forms the
most lively representation of Him who is the source and the centre of
all beauty and perfection. “God is a sun,” the sun of the moral and
spiritual universe, from whom all the emanations of knowledge, love and
felicity descend. “He covereth himself with light as with a garment.”
and “dwells in light inaccessible and full of glory.” The felicity
and enjoyments of the future world are adumbrated under the ideas of
_light_ and _glory_. “The glory of God enlightens the celestial city,”
its inhabitants are represented as “the saints _in light_,” it is
declared that “their _sun_ shall no more go down,” and that “the Lord
God is their _everlasting light_.” So that light not only cheers and
enlivens all beings throughout the material creation, but is the emblem
of the Eternal Mind, and of all that is delightful and transporting in
the scenes of a blessed immortality.

In the formation of light, and the beneficent effects it produces,
the wisdom and goodness of the Almighty are conspicuously displayed.
Without the beams of the sun and the influence of light, what were all
the realms of this world, but an undistinguished chaos and so many
dungeons of darkness? In vain should we roll our eyes around to behold,
amidst the universal gloom, the flowery fields, the verdant plains, the
flowing streams, the expansive ocean, the moon walking in brightness,
the planets in their courses, or the innumerable host of stars. All
would be lost to the eye of man, and the “blackness of darkness” would
surround him for ever. And with how much wisdom has every thing been
arranged in relation to the motion and minuteness of light? Were it
capable of being transformed into a solid substance, and retain its
present velocity, it would form the most dreadful and appalling element
in nature, and produce universal terror and destruction throughout the
universe. That this is not impossible, and could easily be effected by
the hand of Omnipotence, appears from such substances as _phosphorus_,
where light is supposed to be concentrated in a solid state. But in all
its operations and effects, as it is now directed by unerring wisdom
and beneficence, it exhibits itself as the most benign and delightful
element connected with the constitution of the material system,
diffusing splendour and felicity wherever its influence extends.




CHAPTER II.


ON THE REFRACTION OF LIGHT.

Refraction is the turning or bending of the rays of light out of their
natural course.

Light, when proceeding from a luminous body--without being reflected
from any opake substance or inflected by passing near one--is
invariably found to proceed in straight lines without the least
deviation. But if it happens to pass obliquely from one medium to
another, it always leaves the direction it had before and assumes a
new one. This change of direction, or _bending_ of the rays of light,
is what is called _Refraction_--a term which probably had its origin
from the broken appearance which a staff or a long pole exhibits, when
a portion of it is immersed in water--the word, derived from the Latin
_frango_, literally signifying _breaking_ or bending.

When light is thus refracted, or has taken a new direction, it then
proceeds invariably in a straight line till it meets with a different
medium,[7] when it is again turned out of its course. It must be
observed, however, that though we may by this means cause the rays of
light to make any number of angles in their course, it is impossible
for us to make them describe a curve, except in one single case,
namely, where they pass through a medium, the density of which either
uniformly increases or diminishes. This is the case with the light of
the celestial bodies, which passes downwards through our atmosphere,
and likewise with that which is reflected upwards through it by
terrestrial objects. In both these cases it describes a curve of the
hyperbolic kind; but at all other times, it proceeds in straight lines,
or in what may be taken for straight lines without any sensible error.

There are two circumstances essential to refraction. 1. That the rays
of light shall pass out of one medium into another of a different
density, or of a greater or less degree of resistance. 2. That they
pass in an _oblique_ direction. The denser the refracting medium, or
that into which the ray enters, the greater will be its refracting
power; and of two refracting mediums of the same density, that which
is of an oily or inflammable nature will have a greater refracting
power than the other. The nature of refraction may be more particularly
explained and illustrated by the following figure and description.

Let ADHI fig. 2, be a body of water, AD its surface, C a point in which
a ray of light BC enters from the air into the water. This ray, by the
greater density of the water, instead of passing straight forward in
its first direction to K, will be bent at the point C, and pass along
in the direction CE, which is called the _refracted_ ray. Let the line
FG be drawn perpendicular to the surface of the water in C, then it
is evident that the ray BC, in passing out of air, a _rare_ medium,
into a _dense_ medium, as water, is refracted into a ray CE which is
_nearer_ to the perpendicular CG than the incident ray BC, and on the
contrary, the ray EC passing out of a denser medium into a rarer will
be refracted into CB, which is _farther_ from the perpendicular.

[Illustration: _figure 2._]

The same thing may be otherwise illustrated as follows:--suppose a hole
made in one of the sides of the vessel as at _a_, and a lighted candle
placed within two or three feet of it, when empty, so that its flame
may be at L, a ray of light proceeding from it will pass through the
hole _a_ in a straight line LBCK till it reach the bottom of the vessel
at K, where it will form a small circle of light. Having put a mark at
the point K, pour water into the vessel till it rise to the height AD,
and the round spot that was formerly at K, will appear at E; that is,
the ray which went straight forward, when the vessel was empty, to K,
has been bent at the point C, where it falls into the the water, into
the line CE. In this experiment it is necessary that the front of the
vessel should be of glass, in order that the course of the ray may be
seen; and if a little soap be mixed with the water so as to give it a
little mistiness, the ray CE will be distinctly perceived. If, in place
of fresh water we pour in salt water, it will be found that the ray BC
is more bent at C. In like manner alcohol will refract the ray BC more
than salt water, and oil more than alcohol, and a piece of solid glass,
of the shape of the water, would refract the light still more than the
oil.

The angle of refraction depends on the obliquity of the rays falling on
the refracting surface being always such, that the sine of the incident
angle is to the sine of the refracted angle, in a given proportion. The
_incident_ angle is the angle made by a ray of light and a line drawn
perpendicular to the refracting surface, at the point where the light
enters the surface. The _refracted_ angle is the angle made by the ray
in the refracting medium with the same perpendicular produced. The
_sine_ of the angle is a line which serves to measure the angle, being
drawn from a point in one leg perpendicular to the other. The following
figure (fig. 3.) will tend to illustrate these definitions.

[Illustration: _figure 3._]

In this figure BC is the incident ray, CE the refracted ray, DG the
perpendicular, AD the sine of the angle of incidence ACD, and HR the
sine of the angle of refraction GCE. Now, it is a proposition in optics
that,--the sine AD of the angle of incidence BCD is either accurately
or very nearly in a given proportion to the sine HR of the angle of
refraction GCE. This ratio of the sines is as four to three, when the
refraction is made out of air into water, that is AD is to HR as four
to three. When the refraction is out of air into glass, the proportion
is about as thirty-one to twenty, or nearly as three to two. If the
refraction be out of air into diamond it is as five to two, that is
AD : HR :: 5 : 2. The denser the medium is, the less is the angle and
sine of refraction. If a ray of light MC, were to pass from air into
water, or from empty space into air, in the direction MC perpendicular
to the plane NO which separates the two mediums, it would suffer no
refraction, because one of the essentials to that effect is wanting,
namely, the _obliquity_ of the incidence.

It may be also proper to remark, that a ray of light cannot pass out
of a denser medium into a rarer, if the angle of incidence exceed a
certain limit. Thus a ray of light will not pass out of glass into air,
if the angle of incidence exceed 40° 11´; or out of glass into water,
if the angle of incidence exceed 59° 20´. In such cases refraction will
be changed into reflection.

The following common experiments, which are easily performed, will
illustrate the doctrine of refraction. Put a shilling or any other
small object which is easily distinguished, into a bason or any other
similar vessel, and then retire to such a distance as that the edge
of the vessel shall just hide it from your sight. If then you cause
another person to fill the vessel with water, you will then find that
the shilling is rendered perfectly visible, although you have not in
the slightest degree changed your position. The reason of this is,
that the rays of light, by which it is rendered visible, _are bent
out of their course_. Thus, suppose the shilling to have been placed
in the bottom of the bason at E, (fig. 2.) the ray of light BC which
passes obliquely from the air into water at C, instead of continuing
its course to K, takes the direction CE, and consequently an object
at E would be rendered visible by rays proceeding in that direction,
when they would not have touched it had they proceeded in their direct
course.

The same principle is illustrated by the following experiment. Place
a bason or square box on a table, and a candle at a small distance
from it; lay a small rod or stick across the sides of the bason, and
mark the place where the extremity of the shadow falls, by placing a
shilling or other object at the point; then let water be poured into
the bason, and the shadow will then fall much nearer to the side next
the candle than before. This experiment may likewise be performed by
simply observing the change produced on the shadow of the side of
the bason itself. Again, put a long stick obliquely into deep water,
and the stick will seem to be broken at the point where it appears
at the surface of the water--the part which is immersed in the water
appearing to be bent upwards. Hence every one must have observed that,
in rowing a boat, the ends of the oars appear bent or broken every time
they are immersed in the water, and their appearance at such times is
a representation of the course of the refracted rays. Again, fill a
pretty deep jar with water, and you will observe the bottom of the jar
considerably elevated, so that it appears much shallower than it did
before the water was poured in, in the proportion of nearly a third of
its depth, which is owing to the same cause as that which makes the
end of a stick immersed in water appear more elevated than it would do
if there were no refraction. Another experiment may be just mentioned.
Put a sixpence in a wine-glass, and pour upon it a little water.
When viewed in a certain position, two sixpences will appear in the
glass--one image of the sixpence from below, which comes directly to
the eye, and another which appears considerably raised above the other,
in consequence of the rays of light rising through the water, and being
refracted. In this experiment the wine-glass should not be more than
half filled with water.

The refraction of light explains the causes of many curious and
interesting phenomena both in the heavens and on the earth. When we
stand on the banks of a river, and look obliquely through the waters
to its bottom, we are apt to think it is much shallower than it really
is. If it be eight feet deep in reality, it will appear from the bank
to be only six feet; if it be five feet and a half deep, it will appear
only about four feet. This is owing to the effects of refraction, by
which the bottom of the river is apparently raised by the refraction
of the light passing through the water into air, so as to make the
bottom appear higher than it really is, as in the experiment with the
jar of water. This is a circumstance of some importance to be known
and attended to in order to personal safety. For many school-boys and
other young persons have lost their lives by attempting to ford a
river, the bottom of which appeared to be within their reach, when they
viewed it from its banks: and even adult travellers on horseback have
sometimes fallen victims to this optical deception; and this is not
the only case in which a knowledge of the laws of nature may be useful
in guarding us against dangers and fatal accidents.

It is likewise owing to this refractive power in water, that a skilful
marksman who wishes to shoot fish under water, is obliged to take aim
considerably _below_ the fish as it appears, because it seems much
nearer the top of the water than it really is. An acquaintance with
this property of light is particularly useful to divers, for, in any
of their movements or operations, should they aim directly at the
object, they would arrive at a point considerably beyond it; whereas,
by having some idea of the depth of the water, and the angle which a
line drawn from the eye to the object makes with its surface, the point
at the bottom of the water, between the eye and the object at which the
aim is to be taken, may be easily determined. For the same reason, a
person below water does not see objects distinctly. For, as the aqueous
humour of the eye has the same refractive power as water, the rays of
light from any object under water will undergo no refraction in passing
through the cornea, and aqueous humour, and will therefore meet in a
point far behind the retina. But if any person accustomed to go below
water should use a pair of spectacles, consisting of two convex lenses,
the radius of whose surface is three tenths of an inch--which is nearly
the radius of the convexity of the cornea--he will see objects as
distinctly below water as above it.

It is owing to refraction, that we cannot judge so accurately of
magnitudes and distances in water as in air. A fish looks considerably
larger in water than when taken out of it. An object plunged
_vertically_ into water always appears contracted, and the more so as
its upper extremity approaches nearer the surface of the water. Every
thing remaining in the same situation, if we take the object gradually
out of the water, and it be of a slender form, we shall see it become
larger and larger, by a rapid developement, as it were, of all its
parts. The distortion of objects, seen through a crooked pane of glass
in a window, likewise arises from its unequal refraction of the rays
that pass through it. It has been calculated that in looking through
the common glass of a window, objects appear about the one thirtieth of
an inch out of their real place, by means of the refraction.

Refraction likewise produces an effect upon the _heavenly bodies_, so
that their apparent positions are generally different from their real.
By the refractive power of the atmosphere, the sun is seen before he
comes to the horizon in the morning, and after he sinks beneath it in
the evening; and hence this luminary is never seen in the place in
which it really is, except when it passes the zenith at noon, to places
within the torrid zone. The sun is visible, when actually thirty-two
minutes of a degree below the horizon, and when the opake rotundity of
the earth is interposed between our eye and that orb, just on the same
principle as, in the experiment with the shilling and basin of water,
the shilling was seen when the edge of the basin interposed between it
and the sight. The refractive power of the atmosphere has been found
to be much greater, in certain cases, than what has been now stated.
In the year 1595 a company of Dutch sailors having been wrecked on
the shores of Nova Zembla, and having been obliged to remain in that
desolate region during a night of more than three months--beheld the
sun make his appearance in the horizon about sixteen days before the
time in which he should have risen according to calculation, and when
his body was actually more than four degrees below the horizon; which
circumstance has been attributed to the great refractive power of the
atmosphere in those intensely cold regions. This refraction of the
atmosphere, which renders the apparent rising and setting of the sun
both earlier and later than the real, produces at least one important
beneficial effect. It procures for us the benefit of a much longer day,
at all seasons of the year, than we should enjoy, did not this property
of the atmosphere produce this effect. It is owing to the same cause
that the disks of the sun and moon appear elliptical or oval, when seen
in the horizon, their horizontal diameters appearing longer than their
vertical--which is caused by the greater refraction of the rays coming
from the lower limb, which is immersed in the densest part of the
atmosphere.

The illumination of the heavens which precedes the rising of the sun,
and continues sometime after he is set--or, what is commonly called
the morning and evening _twilight_--is likewise produced by the
atmospherical refraction--which circumstance forms a very pleasing and
beneficial arrangement in the system of nature. It not only prolongs
to us the influence of the solar light, and adds nearly two hours to
the length of our day, but prevents us from being transported all at
once from the darkness of midnight to the splendour of noon-day, and
from the effulgence of day to the gloom and horrors of the night--which
would bewilder the traveller and navigator in their journeys by sea or
land, and strike the living world with terror and amazement.

The following figure will illustrate the position now stated, and
the manner in which the refraction of the atmosphere produces these
effects. Let A _a_ C, fig. 4, represent one half of our globe, and the
dark space between that curve and B _r_ D, the atmosphere. A person
standing on the earth’s surface at _a_ would see the sun rise at _b_,
when that luminary was in reality only at _c_--more than half a degree
below the horizon. When the rays of the sun, after having proceeded
in a straight line through empty space, strike the upper part of the
atmosphere at the point _d_, they are bent out of their right-lined
course, by the refraction of the atmosphere, into the direction _d a_,
so that the body of the sun, though actually intercepted by the curve
of the earth’s convexity consisting of a dense mass of land or water,
is actually beheld by the spectator at _a_. The refractive power of the
atmosphere gradually diminishes from the horizon to the zenith, and
increases from the zenith to the horizon, in proportion to the density
of its different strata, being densest at its lower extremity next the
earth, and more rare towards its higher regions. If a person at _a_
had the sun, _e_, in his zenith, he would see him where he really
is; for his rays coming perpendicularly through the atmosphere, would
be equally attracted in all directions, and would therefore suffer no
inflection. But, about two in the afternoon, he would see the sun at
_i_, though, in reality, he was at _k_, thirty-three seconds lower than
his apparent situation. At about four in the afternoon he would see him
at _m_, when he is at _n_, one minute and thirty-eight seconds from his
apparent situation. But at six o’clock, when we shall suppose he sets,
he will be seen at _o_, though he is at that time at _p_, more than
thirty-two minutes below the horizon. These phenomena arise from the
different refractive powers of the atmosphere at different elevations,
and from the obliquity with which the rays of light fall upon it; for
we see every object along that line in which the rays from it are
directed by the last medium through which they passed.

[Illustration: _figure 4._]

The same phenomena happen in relation to the moon, the planets, the
comets, the stars, and every other celestial body, all of which appear
more elevated, especially when near the horizon, than their true
places. The variable and increasing refraction from the zenith to the
horizon, is a source of considerable trouble and difficulty in making
astronomical observations, and in nautical calculations. For, in order
to determine the real altitudes of the heavenly bodies, the exact
degree of refraction, at the observed elevation, must be taken into
account. To the same cause we are to ascribe a phenomenon that has
sometimes occurred--namely, that the moon has been seen rising totally
eclipsed, while the sun was still visible in the opposite quarter of
the horizon. At the middle of a total eclipse of the moon, the sun
and moon are in opposition, or 180 degrees asunder; and, therefore,
were no atmosphere surrounding the earth, these luminaries, in such a
position, could never be seen above the horizon at the same time. But,
by the refraction of the atmosphere near the horizon, the bodies of the
sun and moon are raised more than 32 minutes above their true places,
which is equal, and sometimes more than equal to the apparent diameters
of these bodies.


_Extraordinary cases of refraction in relation to terrestrial objects._

In consequence of the accidental condensation of certain strata of
the atmosphere, some very singular effects have been produced in the
apparent elevation of terrestrial objects to a position much beyond
that in which they usually appear. The following instance is worthy of
notice. It is taken from the Philosophical Transactions of London for
1798, and was communicated by W. Latham, Esq., F.R.S., who observed
the phenomenon from Hastings, on the south coast of England:--‘On July
26, 1797, about five o’clock in the afternoon, as I was sitting in my
dining-room in this place, which is situated upon the Parade, close
to the sea-shore, nearly fronting the south, my attention was excited
by a number of people running down to the sea-side. Upon inquiring
the reason, I was informed, that the coast of France was plainly to
be distinguished by the naked eye. I immediately went down to the
shore, and was surprised to find that, even without the assistance
of a telescope, I could very plainly see the cliffs on the opposite
coast, which, at the nearest part, are between forty and fifty miles
distant, and are not to be discerned from that low situation by the
aid of the best glasses. They appeared to be only a few miles off,
and seemed to extend for some leagues along the coast. I pursued my
walk along the shore eastward, close to the water’s edge, conversing
with the sailors and fishermen upon the subject. They at first would
not be persuaded of the reality of the appearance; but they soon
became so thoroughly convinced by the cliffs gradually appearing more
elevated, and approaching nearer, as it were, that they pointed out and
named to me the different places they had been accustomed to visit,
such as the Bay, the Old Head, or Man, the Windmill, &c. at Boulogne,
St. Vallery, and other places on the coast of Picardy, which they
afterwards confirmed, when they viewed them through their telescopes.
Their observations were, that the places appeared as near as if they
were sailing, at a small distance, into the harbours. The day on which
this phenomenon was seen was extremely hot; it was high water at
Hastings about two o’clock, P.M., and not a breath of wind was
stirring the whole day.’ From the summit of an adjacent hill, a most
beautiful scene is said to have presented itself. At one glance the
spectators could see Dungeness, Dover Cliffs, and the French coast, all
along from Calais to St. Vallery, and, as some affirmed, as far to the
westward as Dieppe, which could not be much less than eighty or ninety
miles. By the telescope, the French fishing-boats were plainly seen at
anchor, and the different colours of the land on the heights, with the
buildings, were perfectly discernible.

This singular phenomenon was doubtless occasioned by an extraordinary
refraction produced either by an unusual expansion, or condensation
of the lower strata of the atmosphere, arising from circumstances
connected with the extreme heat of the season. The objects seem to
have been apparently raised far above their natural positions; for,
from the beach at Hastings, a straight line drawn across towards the
French coast, would have been intercepted by the curve of the waters.
They seem also to have been magnified by the refraction, and brought
apparently four or five times nearer the eye than in the ordinary state
of the atmosphere.

The following are likewise instances of unusual refraction:--When
Captain Colby was ranging over the coast of Caithness, with the
telescope of his great Theodolite, on the 21st of June, 1819, at
eight o’clock, P.M. from Corryhabbie Hill, near Mortlich, in
Banffshire, he observed a brig over the land of Caithness, sailing to
the westward in the Pentland Frith, between the Dunnet and Duncansby
heads. Having satisfied himself as to the fact, he requested his
assistants, Lieutenants Robe and Dawson, to look through the telescope,
which they immediately did, and observed the brig likewise. It was
very distinctly visible for several minutes, while the party continued
to look at it, and to satisfy themselves as to its position. The brig
could not have been less than from ninety to one hundred miles distant;
and, as the station on Corryhabbie is not above 850 yards above the
sea, the phenomenon is interesting. The thermometer was at 44°. The
night and day preceding the sight of the brig had been continually
rainy and misty, and it was not till 7 o’clock of the evening of the
21st that the clouds cleared off the hill.[8]

Captain Scoresby relates a singular phenomenon of this kind, which
occurred while he was traversing the Polar seas. His ship had been
separated by the ice from that of his father for a considerable time,
and he was looking out for her every day, with great anxiety. At
length, one evening, to his utter astonishment, he saw her suspended in
the air, in an inverted position, traced on the horizon in the clearest
colours, and with the most distinct and perfect representation. He
sailed in the direction in which he saw this visionary phenomenon, and
actually found his father’s vessel by its indication. He was divided
from him by immense masses of icebergs, and at such a distance, that
it was quite impossible to have seen the ship in her actual situation,
or to have seen her at all, if her spectrum had not been thus raised
several degrees above the horizon into the sky by this extraordinary
refraction. She was reckoned to be seventeen miles beyond the visible
horizon, and thirty miles distant.

Mrs. Somerville states, that a friend of her’s, while standing on
the plains of Hindostan, saw the whole upper chain of the Himalaya
mountains start into view, from a sudden change in the density of the
air, occasioned by a heavy shower, after a long course of dry and hot
weather. In looking at distant objects through a telescope, over the
top of a ridge of hills, about two miles distant, I have several times
observed, that some of the more distant objects which are sometimes
hid by the interposition of a ridge of hills, are, at other times,
distinctly visible above them. I have sometimes observed, that objects
near the middle of the field of view of a telescope, which was in a
fixed position, have suddenly appeared to descend to the lower part,
or ascend to the upper part of the field, while the telescope remained
unaltered. I have likewise seen, with a powerful telescope, the Bell
Rock Lighthouse, at the distance of about twenty miles, to appear as if
contracted to less than two-thirds of its usual apparent height, while
every part of it was quite distinct and well-defined, and in the course
of an hour or less, it appeared to shoot up to its usual apparent
elevation--all which phenomena are evidently produced by the same cause
to which we have been adverting.

Such are some of the striking effects produced by the refraction of
light. It enables us to see objects in a direction where they are not;
it raises, apparently, the bottoms of lakes and rivers: it magnifies
objects when their light passes through dense mediums: it makes the
sun appear above the horizon, when he is actually below it, and thus
increases the length of our day: it produces the Aurora and the evening
twilight, which forms, in many instances, the most delightful part of a
summer day: it prevents us from being involved in total darkness, the
moment after the sun has descended beneath the horizon: it modifies the
appearances of the celestial bodies, and the directions in which they
are beheld: it tinges the sun, moon, and stars, as well as the clouds,
with a ruddy hue, when near the horizon: it elevates the appearance of
terrestrial objects, and, in certain extraordinary cases, brings them
nearer to our view, and enables us to behold them when beyond the line
of our visible horizon. In combination with the power of reflection,
it creates visionary landscapes, and a variety of grotesque and
extraordinary appearances, which delight and astonish, and sometimes
appal the beholders. In short,--as we shall afterwards see more
particularly--the refraction of light through glasses of different
figures, forms the principle on which telescopes and microscopes
are constructed, by which both the remote and the minute wonders of
creation have been disclosed to view. So that had there been no bodies
capable of refracting the rays of light, we should have remained for
ever ignorant of many sublime and august objects in the remote regions
of the universe, and of the admirable mechanism and the countless
variety of minute objects which lie beyond the range of the unassisted
eye in our lower creation, all of which are calculated to direct our
views, and to enlarge our conceptions of the Almighty Creator.

In the operation of the law of refraction in these and numerous other
instances, we have a specimen of the diversified and beneficent effects
which the Almighty can produce by the agency of a single principle in
nature. By the influence of the simple law of gravitation, the planets
are retained in their orbits, the moon directed in her course around
the earth, and the whole of the bodies connected with the sun preserved
in one harmonious system. By the same law the mountains of our globe
rest on a solid basis, the rivers flow through the plains toward the
seas, the ocean is confined to its prescribed boundaries, and the
inhabitants of the earth are retained to its surface and prevented
from flying upwards through the voids of space. In like manner the law
by which light is refracted produces a variety of beneficial effects
essential to the present constitution of our world and the comfort
of its inhabitants. When a ray of light enters obliquely into the
atmosphere, instead of passing directly through, it bends a little
downwards, so that the greater portion of the rays which thus enter the
atmospheric mass, descend by inflection to the earth. We then enjoy
the benefit of that light which would otherwise have been totally
lost. We perceive the light of day an hour before the solar orb makes
its appearance, and a portion of its light is still retained when
it has descended nearly eighteen degrees below our horizon. We thus
enjoy, throughout the year, seven hundred and thirty hours of light
which would have been lost, had it not been refracted down upon us
from the upper regions of the atmosphere. To the inhabitants of the
polar regions this effect is still more interesting and beneficial.
Were it not for their twilight, they would be involved, for a much
longer period than they now are, in perpetual darkness; but by the
powerful refraction of light which takes place in the frigid zones, the
day sooner makes its appearance towards spring, and their long winter
nights are, in certain cases, shortened by a period of thirty days.
Under the poles, where the darkness of night would continue six months
without intermission, if there were no refraction, total darkness does
not prevail during the one half of this period. When the sun sets, at
the North pole about the 23rd of September, the inhabitants (if any)
enjoy a perpetual aurora, till he has descended 18 degrees below the
horizon. In his course through the ecliptic the sun is two months
before he can reach this point, during which time there is a perpetual
twilight. In two months more he arrives again at the same point, namely
18 degrees below the horizon, when a new twilight commences, which is
continually increasing in brilliancy, for other two months, at the end
of which the body of this luminary is seen rising in all its glory.
So that, in this region, the light of day is enjoyed, in a greater or
less degree, for ten months without interruption, by the effects of
atmospheric refraction; and, during the two months when the influence
of the solar light is entirely withdrawn, the moon is shining above the
horizon for two half months without intermission; and thus it happens,
that no more than two separate fortnights are passed in absolute
darkness; and this darkness is alleviated by the light of the stars and
the frequent coruscations of the Aurora Borealis. Hence, it appears,
that there are no portions of our globe that enjoy, throughout the
year, so large a portion of the solar light, as these northern regions,
which is chiefly owing to the refraction of the atmosphere.

The refraction of light by the atmosphere, combined with its power
of reflecting it, is likewise the cause of that universal light and
splendour which appears on all the objects around us. Were the earth
disrobed of its atmosphere, and exposed naked to the solar beams--in
this case, we might see the sun without having day, strictly so called.
His rising would not be preceded by any twilight as it now is. The most
intense darkness would cover us till the very moment of his rising;
he would then suddenly break out from under the horizon with the same
splendour he would exhibit at the highest part of his course, and would
not change his brightness till the very moment of his setting, when
in an instant all would be black as the darkest night. At noon day we
should see the sun like an intensely brilliant globe shining in a sky
as black as ebony, like a clear fire in the night seen in the midst of
an extensive field, and his rays would show us the adjacent objects
immediately around us; but the rays which fall on the objects remote
from us would be for ever lost in the expanse of the heavens. Instead
of the beautiful azure of the sky, and the colours which distinguish
the face of nature by day, we should see nothing but an abyss of
darkness, and the stars shining from a vault as dark as chaos. Thus
there would be no day, such as we now enjoy, without the atmosphere:
since it is by the refraction and reflections connected with this
aerial fluid that light is so modified and directed, as to produce all
that beauty, splendour and harmony, which appear on the concave of the
sky, and on the objects which diversify our terrestrial abode.

The effect of refraction, in respect to _terrestrial_ objects, is
likewise of a beneficial nature. The quantity of this refraction
is estimated by Dr. Maskelyne at one-tenth of the distance of the
object observed, expressed in degrees of a great circle. Hence, if
the distance be 10,000 fathoms, its tenth part 1000 fathoms, is the
sixtieth part of a degree, or one minute, which is the refraction
in altitude. Le Gendre estimates it at one fourteenth; De Lambre at
one eleventh; and others at a twelfth of the distance; but it must
be supposed to vary at different times and places according to the
varying state of the atmosphere. This refraction, as it makes objects
appear to be raised higher than they really are, enlarges the extent
of our landscapes, and enables us to perceive distant objects which
would otherwise have been invisible. It is particularly useful to
the navigator at sea. It is one important object of the mariner when
traversing his course, to look out for capes and headlands, rocks and
islands, so as to descry them as soon as they are within the reach
of his eye. Now, by means of refraction, the tops of hills and the
elevated parts of coasts, are apparently raised into the air, so that
they may be discovered several leagues further off on the sea than
they would be, did no such refractive power exist. This circumstance
is therefore a considerable benefit to the science of navigation, in
enabling the mariner to steer his course aright, and to give him the
most early warning of the track he ought to take, or of the dangers to
which he may be exposed.

In short, the effects produced by the refraction and reflection of
light on the scenery connected with our globe, teach us that these
principles, in the hand of the Almighty, might be so modified and
directed, as to produce the most picturesque, the most glorious and
wonderful phenomena, such as mortal eyes have never yet seen, and of
which human imagination can form no conception; and in other worlds,
more resplendent and magnificent than ours, such scenes may be fully
realized, in combination with the operation of physical principles and
agents, with which we are at present unacquainted. From what we already
know of the effects of the reflection and the refraction of light, it
is not beyond the bounds of probability to suppose, that in certain
regions of the universe, light may be reflected and refracted through
different mediums, in such a manner, as to present to the view of
their inhabitants the prominent scenes connected with distant systems
and worlds, and to an extent, as shall infinitely surpass the effects
produced by our most powerful telescopes.




CHAPTER III.


ON THE REFRACTION OF LIGHT THROUGH SPHERICAL TRANSPARENT SUBSTANCES, OR
LENSES.

It is to the refraction of light that we are indebted for the use
of lenses or artificial glasses to aid the powers of vision. It
lays the foundation of telescopes, microscopes, camera obscuras,
phantasmagorias, and other optical instruments, by which so many
beautiful, useful, and wonderful effects have been produced. In order
therefore to illustrate the principles on which such instruments are
constructed, it is necessary to explain the manner in which the rays
of light are refracted and modified, when passing through spherical
mediums of different forms. I do not intend however to enter into
the minutiæ of this subject, nor into any abstract mathematical
demonstrations, but shall simply offer a few explanations of general
principles, and several experimental illustrations, which may enable
the general reader to understand the construction of the optical
instruments to be afterwards described.

A lens is a transparent substance of a different density from the
surrounding medium, and terminating in two surfaces, either both
spherical, or one spherical and the other plain. It is usually made
of _glass_, but may also be formed of any other transparent substance,
as ice, crystal, diamond, pebbles, or by fluids of different densities
and refractive powers, enclosed between concave glasses. Lenses are
ground into various forms, according to the purpose they are intended
to serve. They may be generally distinguished as being either _convex_
or _concave_. A convex glass is thickest in the middle, and thinner
towards the edges. A concave glass is thin in the middle, and thicker
towards the extremities. Of these there are various forms, which are
represented in fig. 5. A, is a _plano-convex_ lens, which has one side
plane, and the other spherical or convex. B, is a _plano-concave_,
which is plane on the one side and concave on the other. C, is a
_double-convex_, or one which is spherical on both sides. D, a
_double-concave_, or concave on both sides. E, is called a _meniscus_,
which is convex on one side and concave on the other. F, is a
_concavo-convex_, the convex side of which is of a smaller sphere than
the concave. In regard to the _degree_ of convexity or concavity in
lenses, it is evident that there may be almost an infinite variety. For
every convex surface is to be considered as the segment of a circle,
the diameter and radius of which may vary to almost any extent. Hence,
lenses have been formed by opticians, varying from one-fiftieth of an
inch in radius, to two hundred feet. When we speak of the length of
the radius of a lens,--as for instance, when we say that a lens is two
inches or forty inches radius, we mean, that the convex surface of the
glass is the part of a circle the radius of which, or half the diameter
is two inches or forty inches; or in other words, were the portion of
the sphere on which it is ground formed into a globe of corresponding
convexity, it would be four inches or eighty inches in diameter.

[Illustration: _figure 5._]

[Illustration: _figure 6._]

[Illustration: _figure 7._]

[Illustration: _figure 8._]

The _axis_ of a lens is a straight line drawn through the center of its
spherical surface; and as the spherical sides of every lens are arches
of circles the axis of the lens would pass through the centre of that
circle of which its sides are segments. _Rays_ are those emanations
of light which proceed from a luminous body, or from a body that is
illuminated. The _Radiant_ is that body or object which emits the rays
of light--whether it be a self-luminous body, or one that only reflects
the rays of light. Rays may proceed from a Radiant in different
directions. They may be either parallel, converging, or diverging.
_Parallel_ rays are those which proceed _equally distant_ from each
other through their whole course. Rays proceeding from the sun, the
planets, the stars, and distant terrestrial objects are considered as
parallel, as in fig. 6. _Converging_ rays are such as, proceeding from
a body, approach nearer and nearer in their progress, tending to a
certain point where they all unite. Thus, the rays proceeding from the
object AB, (fig. 7.) to the point F, are said to converge towards that
point. All convex glasses cause parallel rays, which fall upon them
to converge in a greater or less degree; and they render converging
rays still more convergent. If AB, fig. 7. represent a convex lens,
and H G I parallel rays falling upon it, they will be refracted and
converge towards the point F, which is called the _focus_, or burning
point; because, when the sun’s rays are thus converged to a point by a
large lens, they set on fire combustible substances. In this point the
rays meet and intersect each other. _Diverging rays_ are those which,
proceeding from any point as A, fig. 8, continually recede from each
other as they pass along in their course towards BC. All the rays which
proceed from near objects as a window in a room, or an adjacent house
or garden are more or less divergent. The following figures show the
effects of parallel, converging and diverging rays in passing through
a double convex lens.

[Illustration: _figure 11._]

[Illustration: _figure 9._]

[Illustration: _figure 10._]

Fig. 9, shows the effects of parallel rays, KA, DE, LB, falling on a
convex glass AB. The rays which fall near the extremities at A and B,
are bent or refracted towards CF, the focus, and centre of convexity.
It will be observed, that they are less refracted as they approach
the center of the lens, and the central ray DEC, which is called the
_axis_ of the lens, and which passes through its center, suffers
no refraction. Fig. 10, exhibits the course of _converging_ rays,
when passing through a similar lens. In this case the rays converge
to a focus _nearer_ to the lens than the center; for a convex lens
uniformly increases the convergence of converging rays. The converging
rays here represented, may be conceived as having been refracted by
another convex lens of a longer focus, and, passing on towards a point
of convergence, were intercepted by the lens AB. The point D is the
place where the rays would have converged to a focus, had they not been
thus intercepted. Fig. 11, represents the course of diverging rays
when falling on a double convex glass. In this case the rays D B, D A,
&c., after passing through the lens, converge to a focus at a point
considerably farther from the lens than its centre, as at F. Such rays
must be considered as proceeding from near objects, and the fact may be
illustrated by the following experiment. Take a common reading-glass,
and hold it in the rays of the sun, opposite a sheet of writing-paper
or a white wall, and observe _at what distance_ from the glass the rays
on the paper converge to a small distinct white spot. This distance
gives the focal length of the lens by parallel rays. If now, we hold
the glass within a few feet of a window, or a burning candle, and
receive its image on the paper, the focal distance of the image from
the glass will be found to be longer. If, in the former case, the focal
distance was twelve inches,--in the latter case it will be thirteen,
fifteen, or sixteen inches, according to the distance of the window or
the candle from the glass.

If the lens A B, fig. 9, on which parallel rays are represented as
falling, were a _plano-convex_, as represented at A, fig, 5, the rays
would converge to a point P, at double the radius, or the whole
diameter of the sphere of which it is a segment. If the thickness of a
plano-convex be considered, and if it be exposed on its convex side to
parallel rays, as those of the sun, the focus will be at the distance
of _twice the radius, wanting two-thirds of the thickness of the lens_.
But if the same lens be exposed with its plane side to parallel rays,
the focus will then be precisely at the distance of twice the radius
from the glass.

The effects of _concave_ lenses are directly opposite to those of
convex. Parallel rays, striking one of those glasses, instead of
converging towards a point, are made to _diverge_. Rays already
divergent are rendered more so, and convergent rays are made less
convergent. Hence objects seen through concave glasses appear
considerably smaller and more distant than they really are. The
following diagram, fig. 12, represents the course of parallel rays
through a double concave lens, where the parallel rays T A, D E, I B,
&c., when passing through the concave glass A B, diverge into the rays
G L, E C, H P, &c., as if they proceeded from F, a point before the
lens, which is the principal focus of the lens.

[Illustration: _figure 12._]

The principal focal distance E F, is the same as in convex lenses.
Concave glasses are used to correct the imperfect vision of
short-sighted persons. As the form of the eye of such persons is too
convex, the rays are made to converge before they reach the optic
nerve; and therefore a concave glass, causing a little divergency,
assists this defect of vision, by diminishing the effect produced
by the too great convexity of the eye, and lengthening its focus.
These glasses are seldom used, in modern times, in the construction
of optical instruments, except as eye-glasses for small pocket
perspectives, and opera glasses.

_To find the focal distance of a concave glass._ Take a piece of
paste-board or card paper, and cut a round hole in it, not larger
than the diameter of the lens; and, on another piece of paste-board,
describe a circle whose diameter is just double the diameter of the
hole. Then apply the piece with the hole in it to the lens, and hold
them in the sun-beams, with the other piece at such a distance behind,
that the light proceeding from the hole may spread or diverge so as
precisely to fill the circle; then the distance of the circle from the
lens is equal to its virtual focus, or to its radius, if it be a double
concave, and to its diameter, if a plano-concave. Let _d, e_, (fig.
12,) represent the diameter of the hole, and _g, i_, the diameter of
the circle, then the distance C, I, is the virtual focus of the lens.[9]

The _meniscus_ represented at E, fig. 5, is like the crystal of a
common watch, and as the convexity is the same as the concavity,
it neither magnifies nor diminishes. Sometimes, however, it is
made in the form of a crescent, as at F, fig. 5, and is called a
_concavo-convex_ lens; and, when the convexity is greater than the
concavity, or, when it is thickest in the middle, it acts nearly in the
same way as a double or plano-convex lens of the same focal distance.


_Of the_ IMAGES _formed by convex lenses._

It is a remarkable circumstance, and which would naturally excite
admiration, were it not so common and well known, that _when the rays
of light from any object are refracted through a convex lens, they
paint a distinct and accurate picture of the object before it, in all
its colours, shades, and proportions_. Previous to experience, we
could have had no conception that light, when passing through such
substances, and converging to a point, could have produced so admirable
an effect,--an effect on which the construction and utility of all our
optical instruments depend. The following figure will illustrate this
position. Let L, N, represent a double convex lens, A, C, _a_, its
axis, and OB, an object perpendicular to it. A ray passing from the
extremity of the object at O, after being refracted by the lens at F,
will pass on in the direction FI, and form an image of that part of the
object at I. This ray will be the axis of all the rays which fall on
the lens from the point O, and I will be the focus where they will all
be collected. In like manner BCM, is the axis of that parcel of rays
which proceed from the extremity of the object B, and their focus will
be at M; and since all the points in the object between O, and B, must
necessarily have their foci between I and M, a complete picture of the
points from which they come will be depicted, and consequently an image
of the whole object OB.

[Illustration: _figure 13._]

It is obvious, from the figure, that the image of the object is
formed in the focus of the lens, in an _inverted position_. It must
necessarily be in this position, as the rays cross at C, the centre of
the lens; and as it is impossible that the rays from the upper part
of the object O, can be carried by refraction to the upper end of
the image at M. This is a universal principle in relation to convex
lenses of every description, and requires to be attended to in the
construction and use of all kinds of telescopes and microscopes. It
is easily illustrated by experiment. Take a convex lens of eight,
twelve, or fifteen inches focal distance, such as a reading glass, or
the glass belonging to a pair of spectacles, and holding it, at its
focal distance from a white wall, in a line with a burning candle, the
flame of the candle will be seen depicted on the wall in an inverted
position, or turned upside down. The same experiment may be performed
with a window-sash, or any other bright object. But, the most beautiful
exhibition of the images of objects formed by convex lenses, is made
by darkening a room, and placing a convex lens of a long focal distance
in a hole cut out of the window-shutter; when a beautiful inverted
landscape, or picture of all the objects before the window, will be
painted on a white paper or screen placed in the focus of the glass.
The image thus formed exhibits not only the proportions and colours,
but also the motions of all the objects opposite the lens, forming as
it were a living landscape. This property of lenses lays the foundation
of the camera obscura, an instrument to be afterwards described.

The following principles in relation to images formed by convex lenses
may be stated. 1. That _the image subtends the same angle at the centre
of the glass as the object itself does_. Were an eye placed at C, the
centre of the lens LN, fig. 13, it would see the object OB, and the
image IM under the same optical angle, or, in other words, they would
appear equally large. For, whenever right lines intersect each other,
as OI and BM, the opposite angles are always equal, that is, the angle
MCI is equal to the angle OCB. 2. _The length of the image formed by
a convex lens, is to the length of the object, as the distance of the
image is to the distance of the object from the lens_: that is, MI is
to OB :: as CA to CA. Suppose the distance of the object CA
from the lens, to be forty-eight inches, the length of the object OB
= sixteen inches, and the distance of the image from the lens, six
inches, then the length of the image will be found by the following
proportion, 48 : 16 :: 6 : 2, that is, the length of the image, in such
a case, is two inches. 3. _If the object be at an infinite distance,
the image will be formed exactly in the focus._ 4. _If the object be
at the same distance from the lens as its focus, the image is removed
to an infinite distance on the opposite side_; in other words, the
rays will proceed in a _parallel_ direction. On this principle, lamps
on the streets are sometimes directed to throw a bright light along a
foot-path where it is wanted, when a large convex glass is placed at
its focal distance from the burner; and on the same principle, light
is thrown to a great distance from lighthouses, either by a very large
convex lens of a short focal distance, or by a concave reflector. 5.
_If the object be at double the distance of the focus from the glass,
the image will also be at double the distance of the focus from the
glass._ Thus, if a lens of six inches focal distance be held at twelve
inches distance from a candle, the image of the candle will be formed
at twelve inches from the glass on the other side. 6. _If the object
be a little further from the lens than its focal distance, an image
will be formed, at a distance from the object, which will be greater
or smaller in proportion to the distance._ For example, if a lens
five inches focus, be held at a little more than five inches from a
candle, and a wall or screen at five feet six inches distant, receive
the image, a large and inverted image of the candle will be depicted,
which will be magnified in proportion as the distance of the wall
from the candle exceeds the distance of the lens from the candle.
Suppose the distance of the lens to be five and a half inches, then
the distance of the wall where the image is formed, being twelve times
greater, the image of the candle will be magnified twelve times. If
MI (fig. 13.) be considered as the object, then OB will represent the
magnified image on the wall. On this principle the image of the object
is formed by the small object glass of a compound microscope. On the
same principle the large pictures are formed by the Magic Lantern and
the Phantasmagoria; and in the same way small objects are represented
in a magnified form, on a sheet or wall by the Solar microscope. 7.
_All convex lenses magnify the objects seen through them, in a greater
or less degree._ The shorter the focal distance of the lens, the
greater is the magnifying power. A lens four inches focal distance,
will magnify objects placed in the focus, two times in length and
breadth; a lens two inches focus will magnify four times, a lens one
inch focus eight times; a lens half an inch focus sixteen times, &c.
supposing eight inches to be the least distance at which we see near
objects distinctly. In viewing objects with small lenses, the object
to be magnified should be placed exactly at the focal distance of the
lens, and the eye at about the same distance on the other side of
the lens. When we speak of magnifying power, as, for example, that a
lens one inch focal distance magnifies objects eight times, it is to
be understood of the _lineal_ dimensions of the object. But as every
object at which we look has breadth as well as length, the _surface_
of the object is in reality magnified sixty-four times, or the square
of its lineal dimensions; and for the same reason a lens half an inch
focal distance magnifies the _surfaces_ of objects 256 times.


_Reflections deduced from the preceding subject._

Such are some of the leading principles which require to be recognised
in the construction of refracting telescopes, microscopes, and
other dioptric instruments whose performance chiefly depends on the
_refraction_ of light.--It is worthy of particular notice that all the
phenomena of optical lenses now described, depend upon that peculiar
property which the Creator has impressed upon the rays of light, that,
_when they are refracted to a focus by a convex transparent substance,
they depict an accurate image of the objects whence they proceed_.
This, however common, and however much overlooked by the bulk of
mankind, is indeed a very wonderful property with which light has been
endued. Previous to experience we could have had no conception that
such an effect would be produced; and, in the first instance, we could
not possibly have traced it to all its consequences. All the objects
in creation might have been illuminated as they now are, for aught
we know, without sending forth either direct or reflected rays _with
the property of forming exact representations of the objects whence
they proceeded_. But this we find to be a universal law in regard to
light of every description, whether as emanating directly from the
sun, or as reflected from the objects he illuminates, or as proceeding
from bodies artificially enlightened. It is a law or a property of
light not only in our own system, but throughout all the systems of
the universe to which mortal eyes have yet penetrated. The rays from
the most distant star which astronomers have descried, are endued
with this property, otherwise they could never have been perceived by
means of our optical instruments; for it is by the pictures or images
formed in these instruments that such distant objects are brought to
view. Without this property of light, therefore, we should have had
no telescopes, and consequently we could not have surveyed, as we can
now do, the hills and vales, the deep caverns, the extensive plains,
the circular ranges of mountains, and many other novel scenes which
diversify the surface of our moon. We should have known nothing of the
stupendous spots which appear on the surface of the sun--of the phases
of Venus--of the satellites and belts of Jupiter--of the majestic rings
of Saturn--of the existence of Uranus and his six moons,--or of the
planets Vesta, Juno, Ceres, and Pallas, nor could the exact bulks of
any of these bodies have been accurately determined. But, above all,
we should have been entirely ignorant of the wonderful phenomena of
double stars--which demonstrate that suns revolve around suns--of the
thousands and millions of stars which crowd the profundities of the
Milky Way and other regions of the heavens--of the thousands of Nebulæ
or starry systems which are dispersed throughout the immensity of the
firmament, and many other objects of sublimity and grandeur, which fill
the contemplative mind with admiration and awe, and raise its faculties
to higher conceptions than it could otherwise have formed of the
omnipotence and grandeur of the Almighty Creator.

Without this property of the rays of light we should likewise have
wanted the use of the microscope--an instrument which has disclosed a
world invisible to common eyes, and has opened to our view the most
astonishing exhibitions of Divine mechanism, and of the wisdom and
intelligence of the Eternal Mind. We should have been ignorant of
those tribes of living beings, invisible to the unassisted eye, which
are found in water, vinegar, and many other fluids--many of which are
twenty thousand times smaller than the least visible point, and yet
display the same admirable skill and contrivance in their construction,
as are manifested in the formation of the larger animals. We should
never have beheld the purple tide of life, and even the globules of the
blood rolling with swiftness through veins and arteries smaller than
the finest hair; or had the least conception that numberless species
of animated beings, so minute that a million of them are less than
a grain of sand, could have been rendered visible to human eyes, or
that such a number of vessels, fluids, movements, diversified organs
of sensation, and such a profusion of the richest ornaments and the
gayest colours could have been concentrated in a single point. We
should never have conceived that even the atmosphere is replenished
with invisible animation, that the waters abound with countless myriads
of sensitive existence, that the whole earth is full of life, and
that there is scarcely a tree, plant, or flower, but affords food and
shelter to a species of inhabitants peculiar to itself, which enjoy
the pleasures of existence and share in the bounty of the Creator. We
could have formed no conception of the beauties and the varieties of
mechanism which are displayed in the scenery of that invisible world
to which the microscope introduces us--beauties and varieties, in
point of ornament and delicate contrivance, which even surpass what is
beheld in the visible operations and aspect of nature around us. We
find joints, muscles, a heart, stomach, entrails, veins, arteries, a
variety of motions, a diversity of forms, and a multiplicity of parts
and functions--in breathing atoms. We behold in a small fibre of a
peacock’s feather, not more than one-eighth of an inch in length, a
profusion of beauties no less admirable than is presented by the whole
feather to the naked eye--a stem sending out multitudes of lateral
branches, each of which emits numbers of little sprigs, which consist
of a multitude of bright shining globular parts, adorned with a rich
variety of colours. In the sections of plants, we see thousands and
ten thousands of tubes and pores, and other vessels for the conveyance
of air and juices for the sustenance of the plant; in some instances,
more than ten hundred thousand of these being compressed within the
space of a quarter of an inch in diameter, and presenting to the eye
the most beautiful configurations. There is not a weed, nor a moss, nor
the most insignificant vegetable, which does not show a multiplicity
of vessels disposed in the most curious manner for the circulation of
sap for its nourishment, and which is not adorned with innumerable
graces for its embellishment. All these and ten thousands of other
wonders which lie beyond the limits of natural vision, in this new and
unexplored region of the universe, would have been for ever concealed
from our view, had not the Creator endued the rays of light with the
power of _depicting the images of objects_, when refracted by convex
transparent substances.

In this instance, as well as in many others, we behold a specimen of
the admirable and diversified effects, which the Creator can produce
from the agency of a single principle in nature. By means of optical
instruments, we are now enabled to take a more minute and expansive
view of the amazing operations of nature, both in heaven and on earth,
than former generations could have surmised. These views tend to raise
our conceptions of the attributes of that Almighty Being, who presides
over all the arrangements of the material system, and to present them
to our contemplation in a new, a more elevated, and expansive point of
view. There is, therefore, a connection which may be traced between the
apparently accidental principle of the rays of light forming images of
objects, and the comprehensive views we are now enabled to take of the
character and perfections of the Divinity. Without the existence of the
law or principle alluded to, we could not, in the present state, have
formed precisely the same conceptions either of the Omnipotence, or of
the wisdom and intelligence of the Almighty. Had no microscope ever
been invented, the idea never could have entered into the mind of man,
that worlds of living beings exist beyond the range of natural vision,
that organized beings possessed of animation exist, whose whole bulk
is less than the ten hundred thousandth part of the smallest grain of
sand; that, descending from a visible point to thousands of degrees
beyond it, an invisible world exists, peopled with tribes of every form
and size, the extent of which, and how far it verges towards infinity
downwards, mortals have never yet explored, and perhaps will never be
able to comprehend. This circumstance alone presents before us the
perfections of the divinity in a new aspect, and plainly intimates that
it is the will and the intention of the Deity, that we should explore
his works, and investigate the laws by which the material world is
regulated, that we may acquire more expansive views of his character
and operations. The inventions of man in relation to art and science,
are not therefore to be considered as mere accidental occurrences, but
as special arrangements in the divine government, for the purpose of
carrying forward the human mind to more clear and ample views of the
scenes of the universe, and of the attributes and the agency of Him
“who is wonderful in counsel and excellent in working.”




CHAPTER IV.


ON THE REFLECTION OF LIGHT.

The _reflection_ of the rays of light is that property by which--after
approaching the surfaces of bodies, they are thrown back, or repelled.
It is in consequence of this property that all the objects around
us, and all the diversified landscapes on our globe, are rendered
visible. It is by light reflected from their surfaces that we perceive
the planetary bodies and their satellites, the belts of Jupiter, the
rings of Saturn, the various objects which diversify the surface of
the Moon, and all the bodies in the universe which have no light of
their own. When the rays of light fall upon rough and uneven surfaces,
they are reflected very irregularly and scattered in all directions,
in consequence of which thousands of eyes, at the same time, may
perceive the same objects, in all their peculiar colours, aspects,
and relations. But, when they fall upon certain smooth and polished
surfaces, they are reflected with regularity, and according to certain
laws. Such surfaces, when highly polished, are called _Mirrors_ or
_Speculums_; and it is to the reflection of light from such surfaces,
and the effects it produces, that I am now to direct the attention of
the reader.

Mirrors or Specula, may be distinguished into three kinds, _plane_,
_concave_, and _convex_, according as they are bounded by plane or
spherical surfaces. These are made either of _metal_ or of _glass_,
and have their surfaces highly polished for the purpose of reflecting
the greatest number of rays. Those made of glass are foliated or
quicksilvered on one side; and the metallic specula are generally
formed of a composition of different metallic substances, which,
when accurately polished, is found to reflect the greatest quantity
of light. I shall, in the first place, illustrate the phenomena of
reflection produced by _plane-mirrors_.

When light impinges, or falls, upon a polished flat surface,
rather more than the half of it is reflected, or thrown back in a
direction similar to that of its approach; that is to say, if it fall
_perpendicularly_ on the polished surface, it will be perpendicularly
reflected; but if it fall _obliquely_, it will be reflected with
the same obliquity. Hence, the following fundamental law, regarding
the reflection of light, has been deduced both from experiment and
mathematical demonstration, namely, that _the angle of reflection is,
in all cases, exactly equal to the angle of incidence_. This is a law
which is universal in all cases of reflection, whether it be from
plane or spherical surfaces, or whether these surfaces be concave or
convex, and which requires to be recognized in the construction of all
instruments which depend on the reflection of the rays of light. The
following figure (fig. 14) will illustrate the position now stated.

Let AB represent a plane mirror, and CD a line or ray of light
perpendicular to it. Let FD represent the _incident_ ray from any
object, then DE will be the reflected ray, thrown back in the
direction from D to E, and it will make with the perpendicular CD the
same angle which the incident ray FD did with the same perpendicular,
that is, the angle FDC will be equal to the angle EDC, in all cases of
obliquity. The incident ray of light may be considered as rebounding
from the mirror, like a tennis ball from a marble pavement, or the wall
of a court.

[Illustration: _figure 14._]

In viewing objects by reflection we see them in a different direction
from that in which they really are, namely, along the line in which the
rays come to us last. Thus, if AB (fig. 15) represent a plane mirror,
the image of an object C appears to the eye at E behind the mirror, in
the direction EG, and always in the intersection G of the perpendicular
CG, and the reflected ray EG--and consequently at G as far behind
the mirror, as the object C is before it. We therefore see the image
in the line EG, the direction in which the reflected rays proceed. A
plane mirror does not alter the figure or size of objects; but the
whole image is equal and similar to the whole object, and has a like
situation with respect to one side of the plane, that the object has
with respect to the other.

[Illustration: _figure 15._]

Mr. Walker illustrates the manner in which we see our faces in a mirror
by the following figure (16). AB represents a mirror, and
OC, a person looking into it. If we conceive a ray proceeding from
the forehead CE, it will be sent to the eye at O,
agreeably to the angle of incidence and reflection. But the mind puts
CEO into one line, and the forehead is seen at H,
as if the lines CEO had turned on a hinge at E.--It
seems a wonderful faculty of the mind to put the two oblique lines
CE and OE into one straight line OH, yet
it is seen every time we look at a mirror. For the ray has really
travelled from C to E, and from E to
O, and it is that journey which determines the distance of the
object; and hence we see ourselves as far beyond the mirror as we stand
from it. Though a ray is here taken only from one part of the face, it
may be easily conceived that rays from every other part of the face
must produce a similar effect.

[Illustration: _figure 16._]

In every plain mirror, the image is always equal to the object, at what
distance soever it may be placed; and as the mirror is only at half
the distance of the image from the eye, it will completely receive an
image of _twice_ its own length. Hence a man six feet high may view
himself completely in a looking glass of three feet in length, and
half his own breadth; and this will be the case at whatever distance
he may stand from the glass. Thus, the man AC (fig. 17) will see the
whole of his own image in the glass AB, which is but one half
as large as himself. The rays from the head pass to the mirror in the
line AA, perpendicular to the mirror, and are returned to the
eye in the same line; consequently, having travelled twice the length
AA, the man must see his head at B. From his feet C rays
will be sent to the bottom of the mirror at B; these will be
reflected at an equal angle to the eye in the direction BA, as
if they had proceeded in the direction DBA, so that the man
will see his foot at D, and consequently his whole figure at BD.

[Illustration: _figure 17._]

A person when looking into a mirror, will always see his own image as
far beyond the mirror as he is before it, and as he moves to or from
it, the image will, at the same time, move towards or from him on the
other side; but apparently with a double velocity, because the two
motions are equal and contrary. In like manner, if while the spectator
is at rest, an object be in motion, its image behind the mirror will
be seen to move at the same time. And if the spectator moves, the
images of objects that are at rest will appear to approach, or recede
from him, after the same manner as when he moves towards real objects;
plane mirrors reflecting not only the object, but the distance also,
and that exactly in its natural dimensions--The following principle is
sufficient for explaining most of the phenomena seen in a plane mirror,
namely;--_That the image of an object seen in a plane mirror, is always
in a perpendicular to the mirror joining the object and the image, and
that the image is as much on one side the mirror, as the object is on
the other_.


_Reflection by Convex and Concave Mirrors._

Both convex and concave mirrors are formed of portions of a sphere.
A convex speculum is ground and polished in a _concave_ dish or tool
which is a portion of a sphere, and a concave speculum is ground upon
a convex tool. The inner surface of a sphere brings parallel rays
to a focus at _one fourth_ of its diameter, as represented in the
following figure, where C is the centre of the sphere on which the
concave speculum AB is formed, and F the focus where parallel rays from
a distant object would be united, after reflection, that is, at one
half the radius, or one fourth of the diameter from the surface of the
speculum. Were a speculum of this kind presented to the sun, F would
be the point where the reflected rays would be converged to a focus,
and set fire to combustible substances if the speculum be of a large
diameter, and of a short focal distance. Were a candle placed in that
focus, its light would be reflected parallel as represented in the
figure. These are properties of concave specula which require to be
particularly attended to in the construction of reflecting telescopes.
It follows, from what has been now stated, that if we intend to form
a speculum of a certain focal distance,--for example, two feet, it is
necessary that _it should be ground upon a tool whose radius is double
that distance_, or four feet.

[Illustration: _figure 18._]


_Properties of Convex Mirrors._

From a convex surface, parallel rays when reflected are made to
diverge; convergent rays are reflected less convergent; and divergent
rays are rendered more divergent. It is the nature of all convex
mirrors and surfaces to scatter or _disperse_ the rays of light, and in
every instance to impede their convergence. The following figure shows
the course of parallel rays as reflected from a convex mirror. AEB is
the convex surface of the mirror; and KA, IE, LB, parallel rays falling
upon it. These rays, when they strike the mirror, are made to diverge
in the direction AG, BH, &c. and both the parallel and divergent rays
are here represented as they appear in a dark chamber, when a convex
mirror is presented to the solar rays. The dotted lines denote only the
course or tendency of the reflected rays, towards the _virtual_ focus
F, were they not intercepted by the mirror. This virtual focus is just
equal to half the radius CE.

[Illustration: _figure 19._]

The following are some of the properties of convex mirrors: 1. The
image appears always erect, and behind the reflecting surface. 2. _The
image is always smaller than the object_, and the diminution is greater
in proportion as the object is further from the mirror, but if the
object touch the mirror, the image at the point of contact is of the
same size as the object. 3. The image does not appear so far behind the
reflecting surface as in a plain mirror. 4. The image of a straight
object, placed either parallel or oblique to the mirror is seen
_curved_ in the mirror; because the different points of the object are
not all at an equal distance from the surface of the mirror. 5. Concave
mirrors have a _real_ focus where an image is actually formed; but
convex specula have only a _virtual_ focus, and this focus is behind
the mirror; no image of any object being formed before it.

The following are some of the purposes to which convex mirrors are
applied. They are frequently employed by painters for reducing the
proportions of the objects they wish to represent, as the images of
objects diminish in proportion to the smallness of the radius of
convexity, and to the distances of objects from the surface of the
mirror. They form a fashionable part of modern furniture, as they
exhibit a large company assembled in a room, with all the furniture it
contains, in a very small compass, so that a large hall with all its
objects, and even an extensive landscape, being reduced in size, may
be seen from one point of view. They are likewise used as the small
specula of those reflecting telescopes which are fitted up on the
_Cassegrainian_ plan, and in the construction of Smith’s Reflecting
Microscope. But on the whole, they are very little used in the
construction of optical instruments.


_Properties of Concave speculums._

Concave specula have properties very different from those which are
convex; they are of more importance in the construction of reflecting
telescopes and other optical instruments; and therefore require more
minute description and illustration. Concave mirrors cause parallel
rays to converge; they increase the convergence of rays that are
already converging; they diminish the divergence of diverging rays;
and, in some cases, render them parallel and even convergent; which
effects are all in proportion to the concavity of the mirror. The
following figures show the course of diverging and parallel rays as
reflected from concave mirrors.

Fig. 20 represents the course of _parallel_ rays, and AB, the concave
mirror on which they fall. In this case, they are reflected so as to
unite at F, which point is distant from its surface _one fourth_ of the
diameter of the sphere of the mirror. This point is called the focus of
parallel rays, or _the true focus of the mirror_. And, since the sun
beams are parallel among themselves, if they are received on a concave
mirror, they will all be reflected to that point, and there burn in
proportion to the quantity of rays collected by the mirror. Fig. 21.
shows the direction of _diverging_ rays, or those which proceed from
a near object. These rays proceeding from an object further from
the mirror than the true focal point, as from D to A and to B, are
reflected converging and meet at a point F, _further from the mirror_
than the focal point of parallel rays. If the distance of the radiant,
or object D, be equal to the radius CE, then will the focal distance
be likewise equal to the radius: That is, if an object be placed in
the center of a concave speculum, the image will be reflected upon the
object, or they will seem to meet and embrace each other in the centre.
If the distance of the radiant be equal to half the radius, its image
will be reflected to an infinite distance, for the rays will then be
parallel. If, therefore, a luminous body be placed at half the radius
from a concave speculum, it will enlighten places directly before it
at great distances. Hence their use when placed behind a candle in a
common lantern; hence their utility in throwing light upon objects in
the Magic Lantern and Phantasmagoria, and hence the vast importance
of very large mirrors of this description, as now used in most of our
Light Houses, for throwing a brilliant light to great distances at sea
to guide the mariner when directing his course under the cloud of night.

[Illustration: _figure 20._]

[Illustration: _figure 21._]

When _converging_ rays fall upon a concave mirror, they are reflected
more converging and unite at a point between the focus of parallel rays
and the mirror; that is, nearer the mirror than one half the radius;
and their precise degree of convergency will be greater than that
wherein they converged before reflection.


_Of the images formed by Concave Mirrors._

If rays proceeding from a distant object fall upon a concave speculum,
they will paint an image or representation of the object on its focus
_before_ the mirror. This image will be inverted, because the rays
cross at the points where the image is formed. We have already seen
that a convex glass forms an image of an object _behind_ it; the rays
of light from objects _pass through_ the glass, and the picture is
formed on the side farthest from the object. But in concave mirrors
the images of distant objects--and of all objects that are farther
from its surface than its principal focus--are formed _before_ the
mirror, or on the same side as the object. In almost every other
respect, however, the effect of a concave mirror is the same as that
of a convex lens, in regard to the formation of images, and the course
pursued by the rays of light, except that the effect is produced in the
one case by refraction, and in the other by reflection. The following
figure represents the manner in which images are formed by concave
mirrors. GF represents the reflecting surface of the mirror; OAB, the
object; and IAM, the image formed by the mirror. The rays
proceeding from O, will be carried to the mirror, in the direction OG,
and according to the law that the angle of incidence is equal to the
angle of reflection, will be reflected to I, in the direction GI. In
like manner the rays from B, will be reflected from F to M, the rays
from A, will be reflected to a, and so of all the intermediate rays, so
that an inverted image of the object OB, will be formed at IM. If the
rays proceeded from objects at a very great distance the image would be
formed in the real focus of the mirror, or at one-fourth the diameter
of the sphere from its surface; but near objects, which send forth
diverging rays, will have their images formed a little farther from the
surface of the mirror.

[Illustration: _figure 22._]

If we suppose a real object placed at IM, then OB will represent its
magnified image, which will be larger than the object, in proportion to
its distance from the mirror. This may be experimentally illustrated
by a concave mirror and a candle. Suppose a concave mirror whose focal
distance is five inches, and that a candle is placed before it, at
a little beyond its focus, (as at IM)--suppose at five and a half
inches,--and that a wall or white screen receives the image, at the
distance of five feet six inches from the mirror, an image of the
candle will be formed on the wall which will be twelve times longer
and broader than the candle itself. In this way concave mirrors may be
made to magnify the images of objects to an indefinite extent. This
experiment is an exact counterpart of what is effected in similar
circumstances by a convex lens, as described p. 74; the mirror
performing the same thing by reflection, as the lens did by refraction.

From what has been stated in relation to concave mirrors it will be
easily understood how they make such powerful burning-glasses. Suppose
the focal distance of a concave mirror to be twelve inches, and its
diameter or breadth twelve inches. When the sun’s rays fall on such
a mirror, they form an image of the sun at the focal point whose
diameter is found to be about one-tenth of an inch. All the rays
which fall upon the mirror are converged into this small point; and
consequently their intensity is in proportion as the square of the
surface of the mirror is to the square of the image. The squares of
these diameters are as 14,400 to 1; and consequently the density of the
sun’s rays, in the focus, is to their density on the surface of the
mirror as 14,400 to 1. That is, the heat of the solar rays in the focus
of such a mirror will be fourteen thousand four hundred times greater
than before--a heat which is capable of producing very powerful effects
in melting and setting fire to substances of almost every description.

Were we desirous of forming an image by a concave speculum which shall
be exactly equal to the object, the object must be placed exactly in
the centre; and, by an experiment of this kind, the centre of the
concavity of a mirror may be found.

In the cases now stated, the images of objects are all formed in the
front of the mirror, or between it and the object. But there is a case
in which the image is formed behind the mirror. This happens when the
object is placed between the mirror and the focus of parallel rays,
and then the image is larger than the object. In fig. 23, GF is a
concave mirror, whose focus of parallel rays is at E. If an object OB
be placed a little within this focus, as at A, a large image IM will
be seen _behind_ the mirror, somewhat curved and erect, which will be
seen by an eye looking directly into the front of the mirror. Here
the image appears at a greater distance behind the mirror than the
object is before it, and the object appears magnified in proportion
to its distance from the focus and the mirror. If the mirror be one
inch focal distance, and the object be placed eight-tenths of an inch
from its surface, the image would be five times as large as the object
in length and breadth, and consequently twenty-five times larger in
surface. In this way small objects may be magnified by reflection, as
such objects are magnified by refraction, in the case of deep convex
lenses. When such mirrors are large, for example six inches diameter,
and eight or ten inches focal distance, they exhibit the human face
as of an enormous bulk. This is illustrated by the following figure.
Let C N, Fig. 24, represent the surface of a concave mirror,
and A a human face looking into it, the face will appear magnified
as represented by the image behind the mirror D Q. Suppose
a ray A C proceeding from the forehead, and another M
N from the chin; these rays are reflected to the person’s eye
at O, which consequently sees the image in the lines of
reflection O D, O Q, and in the angle D O
Q, and consequently magnified much beyond the natural size, and at
a small distance behind the mirror.

[Illustration: _figure 23._]

[Illustration: _figure 24._]

If we suppose the side T U to represent a _convex_ mirror,
and the figure D Q a head of an ordinary size, then the
figure A will represent the diminished appearance which a person’s
face exhibits, when viewed in such a mirror. It will not only appear
reduced, but somewhat distorted; because from the form of the mirror,
one part of the object is nearer to it than another, and consequently
will be reflected under a different angle.

The effect we have now mentioned as produced by _concave_ mirrors,
will only take place when the eye is nearer the mirror than its
principal focus. If the spectator retire beyond this focus--suppose to
the distance of five or six feet, he will not see the image _behind_
the mirror; but he will see his image in a diminished form, hanging
upside down, and suspended in the air, in a line between his eye and
the mirror. In this case, his image is formed _before_ the mirror as
represented at IM fig. 22. In this situation, if you hold out your hand
towards the mirror, the hand of the image will come out towards your
hand, and, when at the centre of concavity, it will be of an equal size
with it, and you may shake hands with this aerial image. If you move
your hand farther, you will find the hand of the image pass by your
hand, and come between it and your body. If you move your hand towards
either side, the hand of the image will move towards the other side;
the image moving always in a contrary direction to the object. All
this while the by-standers, if any, see nothing of the image, because
none of the reflected rays that form it can enter their eyes.--The
following figure represents a phenomenon produced in the same manner.
A B is a concave mirror of a large size; C represents
a hand presented before the mirror, at a point farther distant than
its focus. In this case, an inverted image of the hand is formed which
is seen hanging in the air at M. The rays C and
D go diverging from the two opposite points of the object, and
by the action of the mirror, they are again made to converge to points
at O and S where they cross, form an image, and again
proceed divergent to the eye.[10]

[Illustration: _figure 25._]

In consequence of the properties of concave mirrors, now described,
many curious experiments and optical deceptions have been exhibited.
The appearance of images in the air, suspended between the mirror and
the object, have sometimes been displayed with such dexterity and an
air of mystery, as to have struck with astonishment those who were
ignorant of the cause. In this way birds, flying angels, spectres and
other objects have been exhibited, and when the hand attempts to lay
hold on them, it finds them to be nothing, and they seem to vanish
into air. An apple or a beautiful flower is presented, and when a
spectator attempts to touch it, it instantly vanishes, and a death’s
head immediately appears, and seems to snap at his fingers. A person
with a drawn sword appears before him, in an attitude as if about to
run him through, or one terrific phantom starts up after another, or
sometimes the resemblances of deceased persons are made to appear, as
if, by the art of conjuration, they had been forced to return from the
world of spirits. In all such exhibitions, a very large concave mirror
is requisite, a brilliant light must be thrown upon the objects, and
every arrangement is made, by means of partitions, &c., to prevent
either the light, the mirror, or the object from being seen by the
spectators. The following representation (fig. 26.) shows one of the
methods by which this is effected: A is a large concave
mirror, either of metal or of glass, placed on the back part of a dark
box, D is the performer, concealed from the spectators by
the cross partition C; E is a strong light, which
is likewise concealed by the partition I, which is thrown
upon the actor D, or upon any thing he may hold in his hand.
If he hold a book, as represented in the figure, the light reflected
from it will pass between the partitions C and I to
the mirror, and will be reflected from thence to Z, where
the image of the book will appear so distinct and tangible, that a
spectator looking through the opening at X, will imagine that it is in
his power to take hold of it. In like manner, the person situated at
D, may exhibit his own head or body--a portrait, a painting,
a spectre, a landscape, or any object or device which he can strongly
illuminate.

[Illustration: _figure 26._]

[Illustration: _figure 27._]

[Illustration: _figure 28._]

There is another experiment, made with a concave mirror, which has
somewhat puzzled philosophers to account for the phenomena. Take a
glass bottle AC, (fig. 27) and fill it with water to the point B;
leave the upper part BC empty, and cork it in the common manner. Place
this bottle opposite a concave mirror, and beyond its focus, that
it may appear reversed, and, before the mirror place yourself still
further distant from the bottle, and it will appear in the situation
A B C. Now, it is remarkable in this apparent bottle, that
the _water_, which, according to the laws of catoptrics, should
appear at A B, appears on the contrary at B C, and
consequently, the part A B appears empty. If the bottle be
inverted and placed before the mirror, its image will appear in its
natural erect position, and the water which is in reality at BC (fig.
28) is seen at A B. If while the bottle is inverted, it be
uncorked, and the water run gently out, it will appear, that, while the
part BC is _emptying_, that of A B in the image is filling,
and, what is remarkable, as soon as the bottle is empty, the illusion
ceases, the image also appearing entirely empty.--The remarkable
circumstances in this experiment are, first, not only to see the object
where it is not, but also where its _image_ is not; and secondly, that
of two objects which are really in the same place, as the surface of
the bottle and the water it contains, the one is seen at one place, and
the other at another; and to see the bottle in the place of its image,
and the water where neither it nor its image are.

The following experiments are stated by Mr. Ferguson in his “Lectures
on select Subjects,” &c. “If a fire be made in a large room, and a
smooth mahogany table be placed at a good distance near the wall,
before a large concave mirror, so placed that the light of the fire may
be reflected from the mirror to its focus upon the table; if a person
stand by the table, he will see nothing upon it but a longish beam of
light: but if he stand at a distance toward the fire, not directly
between the fire and mirror, he will see an image of the fire upon the
table, large and erect. And if another person who knows nothing of
the matter beforehand should chance to come into the room, and should
look from the fire toward the table, he would be startled at the
appearance; for the table would seem to be on fire, and by being near
the wainscot, to endanger the whole house. In this experiment there
should be no light in the room but what proceeds from the fire; and the
mirror ought to be at least fifteen inches in diameter. If the fire be
darkened by a screen, and a large candle be placed at the back of the
screen, a person standing by the candle will see the appearance of a
very fine large star, or rather planet, upon the table, as bright as
Venus or Jupiter. And if a small wax taper--whose flame is much less
than the flame of the candle--be placed near the candle, a satellite to
the planet will appear on the table; and if the taper be moved round
the candle, the satellite will go round the planet.”

Many other illustrations of the effects of concave specula might have
been given, but I shall conclude this department by briefly stating
some of the _general properties of speculums_.

1. There is a great resemblance between the properties of _convex_
lenses and _concave_ mirrors. They both form an inverted focal image
of any remote object, by the convergence of the pencil of rays. In
those instruments whose performances are the effects of reflection, as
reflecting telescopes, the concave mirror is substituted in the place
of the convex lens. The whole effect of these instruments, in bringing
to view remote objects in heaven and on earth, entirely depends on the
property of a concave mirror in forming _images_ of objects in its
focus. 2. The image of an object placed beyond the centre, is less
than the object; if the object be placed between the principal focus
and the centre, the image is greater than the object. In both cases
the image is inverted. 3. When the object is placed between the focus
and the mirror, the image situated _behind_ the mirror is greater
than the object, and it has the same direction: in proportion as the
object approaches the focus, the image becomes larger and more distant.
These and similar results are proved by placing a lighted candle at
different distances from a concave mirror. 4. An eye cannot see an
image in the air except it be placed in the diverging rays; but if the
image be received on a piece of white paper, it may be seen in any
position of the eye, as the rays are then reflected in every direction.
5. If a picture drawn according to the rules of perspective, be placed
before a large concave speculum, a little nearer than its principal
focus, the image of the picture will appear extremely natural, and
very nearly like the real objects whence it was taken. Not only are
the objects considerably magnified, so as to approach to their natural
size, but they have also different apparent distances, as in nature, so
that the view of the inside of a church appears very like what it is
in reality, and representations of landscapes appear very nearly, as
they do from the spot whence they were taken. In this respect a large
concave speculum may be made to serve nearly the same purpose, as the
Optical Diagonal Machine, in viewing perspective prints. 6. The concave
speculum is that alone which is used as the great mirror which forms
the first image in reflecting telescopes; and it is likewise the only
kind of speculum used as the small mirror, in that construction of the
instrument called the _Gregorian Reflector_.


_Quantity of light reflected by polished surfaces._

As this is a circumstance connected with the construction of reflecting
telescopes, it may not be improper, in this place, to state some
of the results of the accurate experiments of M. Bonguer on this
subject. This philosopher ascertained that of the light reflected from
mercury, or quicksilver, more than _one-fourth_ is lost, though it is
probable that no substances reflect more light than this. The rays
were received at an angle of eleven and a half degrees of incidence,
measured from the surface of the reflecting body, and not from the
perpendicular. The reflection from _water_ was found to be almost
as great as that of quicksilver; so that in very small angles it
reflects nearly three-fourths of the direct light. This is the reason
why so strong a reflection appears on water, when one walks, in still
weather, on the brink of a lake opposite to the sun. The direct light
of the sun diminishes gradually as it approaches the horizon, while
the reflected light at the same time grows stronger; so that there
is a certain elevation of the sun in which the united force of the
direct and reflected light will be the greatest possible, and this is
when he is twelve or thirteen degrees in altitude. On the other hand,
light reflected from water at _great angles_ of incidence is extremely
small. When the light was perpendicular, it reflected no more than the
thirty-seventh part which mercury does in the same circumstances, and
only the fifty-fifth part of what fell upon it in this case.

Using a smooth piece of glass, one line in thickness, he found that,
when it was placed at an angle of fifteen degrees with the incident
rays, it reflected 628 parts of 1000 which fell upon it; at the same
time, a metallic mirror which he tried in the same circumstances,
reflected only 561 of them. At a less angle of incidence much more
light was reflected; so that at an angle of three degrees, the glass
reflected 700 parts, and the metal something less, as in the former
case. The most striking observations made by this experimenter relate
to the very great difference in the quantity of light reflected at
different angles of incidence. He found that for 1000 incident rays,
the reflected rays, at different angles of incidence, were as follows.

  Angles of           Rays reflected          Rays reflected
  incidence             by water                by glass

     5°                   501                     549
    10                    333                     412
    15                    211                     299
    30                     65                     112
    50                     22                      34
    70                     18                      25
    90                     18                      25

With regard to such mirrors as the specula of reflecting telescopes, it
will be found, in general, that they reflect little more than the _one
half_ of the rays which fall upon them.


_Uncommon appearances in nature produced by the combined influences of
Reflection and Refraction._

The reflection and refraction of the rays of light frequently produce
phenomena which astonish the beholders, and which have been regarded
by the ignorant and the superstitious, as the effects of supernatural
agency. Of these phenomena I shall state a few examples.

One of the most striking appearances of this kind is what has been
termed the _Fata Morgana_, or optical appearances of figures in the
sea and the air, as seen in the Faro of Messina. The following account
is translated from a work of Minasi, who witnessed the phenomenon, and
wrote a dissertation on the subject. “When the rising sun shines from
that point whence its incident ray forms an angle of about forty-five
degrees to the sea of Riggio, and the bright surface of the water
in the bay is not disturbed either by the wind or the current, the
spectator being placed on an eminence of the city, with his back to the
sun and his face to the sea;--on a sudden there appear on the water,
as in a catoptric theatre, various multiplied objects, that is to
say, numberless series of pilasters, arches, castles well delineated,
regular columns, lofty towers, superb palaces, with balconies and
windows, extended alleys of trees, delightful plains with herds and
flocks, armies of men on foot and horseback, and many other strange
images, in their natural colours and proper actions, passing rapidly in
succession along the surface of the sea, during the whole of the short
period of time, while the above mentioned causes remain.--But, if in
addition to the circumstances now described, the atmosphere be highly
impregnated with vapour and dense exhalations, not previously dispersed
by the winds or the sun, it then happens that, in this vapour, as in
a curtain extended along the channel, at the height of about thirty
palms, and nearly down to the sea, the observer will behold the scene
of the same objects, not only reflected from the surface of the sea,
but likewise in the air, though not so distant or well defined, as the
former objects from the sea.--Lastly, if the air be slightly hazy or
opake, and at the same time dewy and adapted to form the iris, the then
above-mentioned objects will appear only at the surface of the sea, as
in the first case, but all vividly coloured or fringed with red, green,
blue and other prismatic colours.”[11]

It is somewhat difficult to account for all the appearances here
described; but, in all probability, they are produced by a calm sea,
and one or more strata of superincumbent air differing in refractive
and consequently in reflective power. At any rate reflection and
refraction are some of the essential causes which operate in the
production of the phenomena.

The _Mirage_, seen in the deserts of Africa, is a phenomenon, in all
probability produced by a similar cause. M. Monge, who accompanied
the French army to Egypt, relates that, when in the desert between
Alexandria and Cairo, the mirage of the blue sky was inverted, and
so mingled with the sand below, as to give to the desolate and arid
wilderness an appearance of the most rich and beautiful country. They
saw, in all directions, green islands, surrounded with extensive lakes
of pure, transparent water. Nothing could be conceived more lovely and
picturesque than the landscape. In the tranquil surface of the lakes,
the trees and houses with which the islands were covered, were strongly
reflected with vivid and varied hues, and the party hastened forward to
enjoy the cool refreshments of shade and stream which these populous
villages proffered to them. When they arrived, the lake on whose bosom
they floated, the trees among whose foliage they were embowered, and
the people who stood on the shore inviting their approach, had all
vanished, and nothing remained but an uniform and irksome desert of
sand and sky, with a few naked huts and ragged Arabs. Had they not been
undeceived by their nearer approach, there was not a man in the French
army who would not have sworn that the visionary trees and lakes had a
real existence in the midst of the desert.

Dr. Clark observed precisely the same appearances at Rosetta. The city
seemed surrounded with a beautiful sheet of water; and so certain was
his Greek interpreter--who was unacquainted with the country--of this
fact, that he was quite indignant at an Arab who attempted to explain
to him that it was a mere optical delusion. At length they reached
Rosetta in about two hours, without meeting with any water; and on
looking back on the sand they had just crossed, it seemed to them as if
they had waded through a vast blue lake.

[Illustration: _figure 29._]

On the 1st of August, 1798, Dr. Vince observed at Ramsgate a ship which
appeared as at A, (fig. 29.) the topmast being the only part
of it that was seen above the horizon. An inverted image of it was seen
at B, immediately above the real ship A, and an erect
image at C, both of them being complete and well defined.
The sea was distinctly seen between them, as at V W. As the
ship rose to the horizon the image C gradually disappeared,
and while this was going on, the image B descended, but the
mainmast of B did not meet the mainmast of A. The
two images BC were perfectly visible when the whole ship was
actually below the horizon. Dr. Vince then directed his telescope to
another ship whose hull was just in the horizon, and he observed a
complete inverted image of it, the mainmast of which just touched the
mainmast of the ship itself. He saw at the same time several other
ships whose images appeared in nearly a similar manner, in one of
which the two images were visible when the whole ship was beneath the
horizon. These phenomena must have been produced by the same causes
which operated in the case formerly mentioned, in relation to Captain
Scoresby, when he saw the figure of his father’s ship inverted in the
distant horizon. Such cases are, perhaps not uncommon, especially in
calm and sultry weather, but they are seldom observed, except when a
person’s attention is accidentally directed to the phenomenon, and,
unless he use a telescope, it will not be so distinctly perceived.

The following phenomenon, of a description nearly related to the above,
has been supposed to be chiefly owing to _reflection_. On the 18th
of November, 1804, Dr. Buchan, when watching the rising sun, about
a mile to the east of Brighton, just as the solar disk emerged from
the surface of the water, saw the face of the cliff on which he was
standing, a windmill, his own figure and the figure of his friend,
distinctly represented, precisely opposite, at some distance from the
ocean. This appearance lasted about ten minutes, till the sun had
risen nearly his own diameter above the sea. The whole then seemed to
be elevated into the air and successively disappeared. The surface of
the sun was covered with a dense fog of many yards in height, which
gradually receded from the rays of the sun as he ascended from the
horizon.

The following appearance most probably arose chiefly from the
_refraction_ of the atmosphere. It was beheld at Ramsgate, by Dr.
Vince of Cambridge and another gentleman. It is well known that
the four turrets of Dover castle are seen at Ramsgate, over a hill
which intervenes between a full prospect of the whole. On the 2nd of
August, 1806, not only were the four turrets visible, but the castle
itself appeared as though situated on that side of the hill nearest
Ramsgate, and so striking was the appearance, that for a long time the
Doctor thought it an illusion; but at last, by accurate observation,
was convinced that it was an actual image of the castle. He, with
another individual, observed it attentively for twenty minutes, but
were prevented by rain from making further observations. Between the
observers and the land from which the hill rises, there were about six
miles of sea, and from thence to the top of the hill there was about
the same distance, their own height above the surface of the water was
about seventy feet.--The cause of this phenomenon was, undoubtedly,
_unequal refraction_. The air being more dense near the ground and
above the sea than at greater heights, reached the eye of the observer,
not in straight but in curvilinear lines. If the rays from the castle
had in their path struck an eye at a much greater distance than
Ramsgate, the probability is, that the image of the castle would have
been inverted in the air; but in the present case,the rays from the
turret and the base of the castle had not crossed each other.

To similar causes as those now alluded to are to be attributed such
phenomena as the following:

_The Spectre of the Brocken._ This is a wonderful and, at first sight,
a terrific phenomenon, which is sometimes seen from the summit of one
of the Hartz mountains in Hanover, which is about 3,300 feet above the
level of the sea, and overlooks all the country fifteen miles round.
From this mountain the most gigantic and terrific spectres have been
seen, which have terrified the credulous, and gratified the curious, in
a very high degree. M. Hawé who witnessed this phenomenon, says, the
sun rose about four o’clock, after he had ascended to the summit, in a
serene sky, free of clouds; and about a quarter past five, when looking
round to see if the sky continued clear, he suddenly beheld at a little
distance, a human figure of _a monstrous size_ turned towards him, and
glaring at him. While gazing on this gigantic spectre, with a mixture
of awe and apprehension, a sudden gust of wind nearly carried off his
hat, and he clapt his hand to his head to detain it, when to his great
delight, the colossal spectre did the same. He changed his body into a
variety of attitudes,all which the spectre exactly imitated, and then
suddenly vanished without any apparent cause, and, in a short time as
suddenly appeared. Being joined by another spectator, after the first
visions had disappeared, they kept steadily looking for the aërial
spectres, when two gigantic monsters suddenly appeared. These spectres
had been long considered as preternatural, by the inhabitants of the
adjacent districts, and the whole country had been filled with awe
and terror. Some of the lakes of Ireland are found to be susceptible
of producing illusions, particularly the lake of _Killarney_. This
romantic sheet of water is bounded on one side, by a semicircle of
rugged mountains, and on the other by a flat morass; and the vapours
generated in the marsh, and broken by the mountains, continually
represent the most fantastic objects. Frequently men riding along
the shore are seen as if they were moving across the lake, which is
supposed to have given rise to the legend of O’Donougho, a magician who
is said to be visible on the lake every May morning.

There can be little doubt that most of those visionary appearances
which have been frequently seen in the sky and in mountainous regions,
are phantoms produced by the cause to which I am adverting, such as
armies of footmen and horsemen, which some have asserted to have been
seen in the air near the horizon. A well authenticated instance of this
kind occurred in the Highlands of Scotland:--Mr. Wren of Wetton Hall,
and D. Stricket his servant, in the year 1744, were sitting at the
door of the house in a summer evening, when they were surprised to see
opposite to them on the side of Sonterfell hill--a place so extremely
steep, that scarce a horse could _walk_ slowly along it--the figure of
a man with a dog pursuing several horses, all running at a most rapid
pace. Onwards they passed till at last they disappeared at the lower
end of the Fell. In expectation of finding the man dashed to pieces by
so tremendous a fall, they went early next morning and made a search,
but no trace of man or horse, or the prints of their feet on the turf
could be found. Sometime afterwards, about seven in the evening, on the
same spot, they beheld a troop of horsemen advancing in close ranks and
at a brisk pace. The inmates of every cottage for a mile round beheld
the wondrous scene, though they had formerly ridiculed the story told
by Mr. Wren and his servant, and were struck with surprise and fear.
The figures were seen for upwards of two hours, till the approach of
darkness rendered them invisible. The various evolutions and changes
through which the troops passed were distinctly visible, and were
marked by all the observers. It is not improbable that these aërial
troopers were produced by the same cause which made the castle of Dover
to appear on the side of the hill next to Ramsgate, and it is supposed
that they were the images of a body of rebels, on the other side of the
hill, exercising themselves previous to the rebellion in 1745.[12]

I shall mention only another instance of this description which lately
occurred in France, and for a time caused a powerful sensation among
all ranks. On Sunday the 17th of December, 1826, the clergy in the
parish of Migné, in the vicinity of Poictiers, were engaged in the
exercises of the Jubilee which preceded the festival of Christmas,
and a number of persons to the amount of 3000 souls assisted in the
service. They had planted as part of the ceremony, a large cross,
twenty-five feet high, and painted red, in the open air beside the
church. While one of the preachers, about five in the evening, was
addressing the multitude, he reminded them of the miraculous cross
which appeared in the sky to Constantine and his army, and the effect
it produced--when suddenly a similar celestial cross appeared in the
heavens just before the porch of the church about 200 feet above
the horizon, and 140 feet in length, and its breadth from three to
four feet, of a bright silver colour tinged with red. The curate
and congregation fixed their wondering gaze upon this extraordinary
phenomenon, and the effect produced on the minds of the assembly
was strong and solemn: they spontaneously threw themselves on their
knees; and many, who had been remiss in their religious duties, humbly
confessed their sins, and made vows of penance and reformation. A
commission was appointed to investigate the truth of this extraordinary
appearance, and a memorial stating the above and other facts was
subscribed by more than forty persons of rank and intelligence, so
that no doubt was entertained as to the reality of the phenomenon.
By many it was considered as strictly miraculous, as having happened
at the time and in the circumstances mentioned. But it is evident,
from what we have already stated, that it may be accounted for on
physical principles. The large cross of wood painted red was doubtless
the real object which produced the magnified image. The state of the
atmosphere, according to the descriptions given in the memorial, must
have been favourable for the production of such images. The spectrum
of the wooden cross must have been cast on the concave surface of
some atmospheric mirror, and so reflected back to the eyes of the
spectators, from an opposite place--retaining exactly the same shape
and proportions, but dilated in size; and what is worthy of attention,
it was tinged with red, the very colour of the object of which it was
the reflected image.

Such phenomena as we have now described, and the causes of them which
science is able to unfold, are worthy of consideration, in order to
divest the mind of superstitious terrors, and enable it clearly to
perceive the laws by which the Almighty directs the movements of the
material system. When any appearance in nature, exactly the reverse
of every thing we could have previously conceived--presents itself
to view, and when we know of no material cause by which it could be
produced, the mind must feel a certain degree of awe and terror, and
will naturally resort to supernatural agency as acting either in
opposition to the established laws of the universe, or beyond the range
to which they are confined. Besides the fears and apprehensions to
which such erroneous conceptions give rise, they tend to convey false
and distorted impressions of the attributes of the Deity and of his
moral government. Science, therefore, performs an invaluable service to
man, by removing the cause of superstitious alarms, by investigating
the laws and principles which operate in the physical system, and by
assigning reasons for those occasional phenomena, which at first sight
appeared beyond the range of the operation of natural causes.

The late ingenious Dr. Wollaston illustrated the causes of some of
the phenomena we have described, in the following manner. He looked
along the side of a red hot poker at a word or object ten or twelve
feet distant; and at a distance less than three eights of an inch from
the line of the poker, an _inverted_ image was seen, and within and
without that image, an _erect_ image, in consequence of the change
produced, by the heat of the poker, in the density of the air. He also
suggested the following experiment as another illustration of the
same principle, namely, viewing an object through a stratum of spirit
of wine lying above water, or a stratum of water laid above one of
syrup. He poured into a _square_ phial a small quantity of clear syrup,
and above this he poured an equal quantity of _water_ which gradually
combined with the syrup, as seen at A. fig. 30. The word ‘Syrup,’ on
a card held behind the bottle, appeared erect when seen through the
pure spirit, but inverted, when seen through the mixture of water and
syrup. He afterwards put nearly the same quantity of rectified spirits
of wine above the water, as seen at B, and he saw the appearance as
represented, namely, the true place of the word ‘Spirit,’ and the
inverted and erect images below. These substances, by their gradual
incorporation, produce refracting power, diminishing from the _spirit
of wine_ to the _water_, or from the _syrup_ to the _water_; so that by
looking through the mixed stratum, an inverted image of any object is
seen behind the bottle. These experiments show that the _mirage_ and
several other atmospherical phenomena may be produced by variations in
the refractive power of different strata of the atmosphere.

[Illustration: _figure 30._]

It is not unlikely that phenomena of a new and different description
from any we have hitherto observed, may be produced from the same
causes to which we have adverted. A certain optical writer remarks--‘If
the variation of the refractive power of the air takes place in a
horizontal line perpendicular to the line of vision, that is, from
right to left, then we may have a _lateral_ Mirage, that is, an image
of a ship may be seen on the right or left hand of the real ship, or
on both, if the variation of refractive power is the same on each side
of the line of vision, and a fact of this kind was once observed on
the Lake of Geneva. If there should happen at the same time, both a
vertical and a lateral variation of refractive power in the air, and
if the variation should be such as to expand or elongate the object in
both directions, then the object would be magnified as if seen through
a telescope, and might be seen and recognized at a distance at which it
would not otherwise have been visible. If the refracting power, on the
contrary, varied, so as to construct the object in both directions, the
image of it would be diminished as if seen through a concave lens.’


_Remarks and Reflections, in reference to the phenomena described
above._

Such, then, are some of the striking and interesting effects
produced by the refraction and the reflection of the rays of light.
As the formation of the _images_ of objects by convex lenses, lays
the foundation of the construction of refracting telescopes and
microscopes, and of all the discoveries they have brought to light, so
the property of _concave specula_, in forming similar images, is that
on which the construction of _Reflecting_ telescopes entirely depends.
To this circumstance Herschel was indebted for the powerful telescopes
he was enabled to construct--which were all formed on the principle of
reflection--and for all the discoveries they enabled him to make in
the planetary system, and in the sidereal heavens. The same principles
which operate in optical instruments, under the agency of man, we have
reason to believe, frequently act on a more expansive scale in various
parts of the system of nature. The magnificent _Cross_ which astonished
the preacher and the immense congregation assembled at Migné, was, in
all probability, formed by a vast atmospherical speculum formed by the
hand of nature, and representing its objects on a scale far superior to
that of human art; and probably, to the same cause is to be attributed
the singular phenomenon of the coast of France having been made to
appear within two or three miles of the town of Hastings, as formerly
described, (see p. 53.) Many other phenomena which we have never
witnessed, and of which we can form no conception, may be produced by
the same cause operating in an infinity of modes.

The facts we have stated above, and the variety of modes by which light
may be refracted and reflected by different substances in nature,
lead us to form some conceptions of the magnificent and diversified
scenes which light may produce in other systems and worlds, under
the arrangements of the all-wise and Beneficent Creator. Light, in
all its modifications and varieties of colour and reflection, may be
considered as the beauty and glory of the universe, and the source
of unnumbered enjoyments to all its inhabitants. It is a symbol of
the Divinity himself; for “GOD IS LIGHT, and in Him is no
darkness at all.” It is a representative of Him who is exhibited in
the Sacred oracles, as “The SUN of Righteousness,” and “the
LIGHT of the world.” It is an emblem of the glories and
felicities of that future world, where knowledge shall be perfected,
and happiness complete; for its inhabitants are designated “the saints
in _light_;” and it is declared in Sacred history, to have been the
first born of created beings. In our lower world, its effects on the
objects which surround us, and its influences upon all sensitive
beings, are multifarious and highly admirable. While passing from
infinitude to infinitude, it reveals the depth and immensity of
the heavens, the glory of the sun, the beauty of the stars, the
arrangements of the planets, the rainbow encompassing the sky with
its glorious circle, the embroidery of flowers, the rich clothing of
the meadows, the valleys standing thick with corn, “the cattle on a
thousand hills,” the rivers rolling through the plains, and the wide
expanse of the ocean. But in other worlds the scenes it creates may
be far more resplendent and magnificent. This may depend upon the
refractive and reflective powers with which the Creator has endowed
the atmospheres of other planets, and the peculiar constitution of the
various objects with which they are connected. It is evident, from
what we already know of the reflection of light, that very slight
modifications of certain physical principles, and very slight additions
to the arrangements of our terrestrial system, might produce scenes of
beauty, magnificence and splendour of which, at present, we can form
no conception. And, it is not unlikely that by such diversities of
arrangement, in other worlds, _an infinite variety_ of natural scenery
is produced throughout the universe.

In the arrangements connected with the planet Saturn, and the immense
rings with which it is encompassed, and in the various positions which
its satellites daily assume with regard to one another, to the planet
itself, and to these rings--there is, in all probability, a combination
of refractions, reflections, light, and shadows, which produce scenes
wonderfully diversified, and surpassing in grandeur what we can now
distinctly conceive. In the remote regions of the heavens, there are
certain bodies composed of immense masses of luminous matter, not yet
formed into any regular system, and which are known by the name of
_Nebulæ_. What should hinder us from supposing that certain exterior
portions of those masses form speculums of enormous size, as some
parts of our atmosphere are sometimes found to do? Such specula may
be conceived to be hundreds and even thousands of miles in diameter,
and that they may form images of the most distant objects in the
heavens, on a scale of immense magnitude and extent, and which may
be reflected, in all their grandeur, to the eyes of intelligences at
a vast distance. And, if the organs of vision of such beings, be far
superior to ours in acuteness and penetrating power, they may thus be
enabled to take a survey of an immense sphere of vision, and to descry
magnificent objects at distances the most remote from the sphere they
occupy. Whatever grounds there may be for such suppositions, it must be
admitted, that all the knowledge we have hitherto acquired respecting
the operation of light, and the splendid effects it is capable of
producing, is small indeed, and limited to a narrow circle, compared
with the immensity of its range, the infinite modifications it may
undergo, and the wondrous scenes it may create in regions of creation
to which human eyes have never yet penetrated,--and which may present
to view objects of brilliancy and magnificence such as, “Eye hath not
yet seen, nor ear heard, nor hath it entered into the heart of man to
conceive.”




CHAPTER V.


SECT. I.--ON THE COLOURS OF LIGHT.

We have hitherto considered light chiefly as a simple homogeneous
substance, as if all its rays were white, and as if they were all
refracted in the same manner by the different lenses on which they
fall. Investigations however, into the nature of this wonderful
fluid, have demonstrated that this is not the case, and that it is
possessed of certain additional properties, of the utmost importance
in the system of nature. Had every ray of light been a pure white, and
incapable of being separated into any other colours, the scene of the
universe would have exhibited a very different aspect from what we
now behold. One uniform hue would have appeared over the whole face
of nature, and one object could scarcely have been distinguished from
another. The different shades of verdure which now diversify every
landscape, the brilliant colouring of the flowery fields, and almost
all the beauties and sublimities which adorn this lower creation would
have been withdrawn. But it is now ascertained that every ray of white
light is composed of an assemblage of colours, whence proceed that
infinite variety of shade and colour with which the whole of our
terrestrial habitation is arrayed. Those colours are found not to be
in the objects themselves, but in the rays of light which fall upon
them, without which they would either be invisible, or wear an uniform
aspect. In reference to this point, Goldsmith has well observed: ‘The
blushing beauties of the rose, the modest blue of the violet, are not
in the flowers themselves, but in the light that adorns them. Odour,
softness, and beauty of figure are their own; but it is light alone
that dresses them up in those robes which shame the monarch’s glory.’

Many strange opinions and hypotheses were entertained respecting
colours, by the ancients, and even by many modern writers, prior to
the time of Sir Isaac Newton. The Pythagoreans called colour the
_superficies_ of bodies; Plato said that it was a flame issuing from
them. According to Zeno it is the first configuration of matter,
and according to Aristotle, it is that which moves bodies actually
transparent. Among the moderns, Des Cartes imagined that the difference
of colour proceeds from the prevalence of the direct or rotatory
motions of the particles of light. Grimaldi, Dechales, and others,
thought the differences of colour depended upon the quick or slow
vibrations of a certain elastic medium filling the whole universe.
Rohault imagined that the different colours were made by the rays of
light entering the eye at different angles with respect to the optic
axis; and Dr. Hook conceived that colour is caused by the sensation
of the oblique or uneven pulse of light; and this being capable of
no more than two varieties, he concluded that there could be no
more than two primary colours. Such were some of the crude opinions
which prevailed before the era of the illustrious Newton, by whose
enlightened investigations the true theory of colours was at last
discovered. In the year 1666 this philosopher began to investigate the
subject; and finding the coloured image of the sun, formed by a glass
prism, to be of an oblong and not of a circular form, as according to
the laws of refraction it ought to be, he was surprised at the great
disproportion between its length and breadth, the former being _five_
times the length of the latter; and he began to conjecture that light
is not _homogeneal_, but that it consists of rays some of which are
much more refrangible than others. Prior to this period, philosophers
supposed that _all_ light, in passing out of one medium into another
of different density was _equally_ refracted in the same or like
circumstances; but Newton discovered that this is not the fact; but
that there are _different species_ of light, and that each species is
disposed both to suffer a different degree of refrangibility in passing
out of one medium into another,--and to excite in us the idea of a
_different colour_ from the rest; and that bodies appear of that colour
which arises from the peculiar rays they are disposed to reflect. It is
now, therefore, universally acknowledged, that the light of the sun,
which to us seems perfectly homogeneal and white, is composed of no
fewer than _seven_ different colours, namely _Red_, _Orange_, _Yellow_,
_Green_, _Blue_, _Indigo and Violet_. A body which appears of a red
colour has the property of reflecting the red rays more powerfully
than any of the others; a body of a green colour reflects the green
rays more copiously than rays of any other colour, and so of the
orange, yellow, blue, purple and violet. A body which is of a _black_
colour, instead of reflecting--_absorbs_ all, or the greater part of
the rays that fall upon it; and, on the contrary, a body that appears
_white_ reflects the greater part of the rays indiscriminately without
separating the one from the other.

Before proceeding to describe the experiments by which the above
results were obtained, it may be proper to give some idea of the form
and effects of the _Prism_ by which such experiments are made. This
instrument is triangular and straight, and generally about three or
four inches long. It is commonly made of white glass, as free as
possible from veins and bubbles, and other similar defects, and is
solid throughout. Its lateral faces, or sides, should be perfectly
plane and of a fine polish. The angle formed by the two faces, one
receiving the ray of light that is refracted in the instrument, and the
other affording it an issue on its returning into the air, is called
the _refracting angle_ of the prism, as ACB, (fig. 31.) The manner in
which Newton performed his experiments, and established the discovery
to which we have alluded, is as follows.

In the window-shutter EG, (fig. 31.) of a dark room, a hole F, was
made, of about one third of an inch diameter, and behind it was
placed a glass prism ACB, so that the beam of light, SF, proceeding
directly from the sun was made to pass through the prism. Before the
interposition of the prism, the beam proceeded in a straight line
towards T, where it formed a round white spot; but being now bent
out of its course by the prism, it formed an oblong image OP, upon
the white pasteboard, or screen LM, containing the seven colours
marked in the figure--the _red_ being the _least_, and the _violet_
the _most_ refracted from the original direction of the solar beam,
ST. This oblong image is called the _prismatic spectrum_. If the
refracting angle of the prism ACB, be 64 degrees, and the distance
of the pasteboard from the prism about 18 feet, the length of the
image OP will be about 10 inches, and the breadth 2 inches. The sides
of the spectrum are right lines distinctly bounded, and the ends are
semicircular. From this circumstance it is evident that it is still
the image of the sun, but elongated by the refractive power of the
prism. It is evident from the figure, that since some part of the
beam, RO, is refracted much further out of its natural course WT, than
some other part of the beam, as WP, the rays towards RO have a much
greater disposition to be refracted than those toward WP; and that this
disposition arises from the naturally different qualities of those
rays, is evident from this consideration, that the refracting angle or
power of the prism is the same in regard to the superior part of the
beam as to the inferior.

[Illustration: _figure 31._]

By making a hole in the screen LM opposite any one of the colours of
the spectrum, so as to allow that colour alone to pass--and by letting
the colour thus separated fall upon a second prism--Newton found that
the light of each of the colours was alike refrangible, because the
second prism could not separate them into an oblong image, or into
any other colour. Hence he called all the seven colours _simple_
or homogeneous, in opposition to _white_ light, which he called
_compound_ or heterogeneous. With the prism which this philosopher
used he found the lengths of the colours and spaces of the spectrum
to be as follows: Red, 45; Orange, 27; Yellow, 40; Green, 60; Blue,
60; Indigo, 48; Violet, 80: or 360 in all. But these spaces vary a
little with prisms formed of different substances, and as they are
not separated by distinct limits, it is difficult to obtain any thing
like an accurate measure of their relative extents. Newton examined
the ratio between the sines of incidence and refraction of these
decompounded rays (see p. 30,) and found that each of the seven primary
colour-making rays, had certain limits within which they were confined.
Thus let the sine of incidence in glass be divided into 50 equal
parts, the sine of refraction into air of the _least_ refrangible,
and the _most_ refrangible rays will contain respectively 77 and 78
such parts. The sines of refraction of all the degrees of _red_ will
have the intermediate degrees of magnitude, from 77 to 77 one-eighth;
_Orange_ from 77 one-eighth to 77 one-fifth; _Yellow_ from 77 one-fifth
to 77 one-third; _Green_ from 77 one-third to 77 one-half; _Blue_
from 77 one-half to 77 two-thirds; _Indigo_ from 77 two-thirds to 77
seven-ninths; and _Violet_ from 77 seven-ninths to 78.

From what has been now stated, it is evident that, in proportion as any
part of an optic glass bears a resemblance to the form of a prism, the
component rays that pass through it must be necessarily separated, and
will consequently paint or tinge the object with colours. The edges of
every convex lens approach to this form, and it is on this account that
the extremities of objects when viewed through them are found to be
tinged with the prismatic colours. In such a glass, therefore, those
different coloured rays will have _different foci_, and will form their
respective images at different distances from the lens. Thus, suppose
LN (fig. 32.) to represent a double convex-lens, and OB an object at
some distance from it. If the object OB was of a pure red colour, the
rays proceeding from it would form a red image at RR; if the
object was of a violet colour, an image of that colour would be formed
at VV, _nearer_ the lens; and if the object was white or any
other combination of the colour-making rays, those rays would have
their respective foci at different distances from the lens, and form a
succession of images, in the order of the prismatic colours, between
the space RR and VV.

[Illustration: _figure 32._]

[Illustration: _figure 33._]

This may be illustrated by experiment in the following manner. Take
a card or slip of white pasteboard, as ABEF, (fig. 33.) and paint
one half ABCD _red_, the other half CF, _violet_ or indigo; and tying
black threads across it, set it near the flame of a candle G, then
take a lens HI, and holding a sheet of white paper behind it, move it
backwards and forwards upon the edge of a graduated ruler, till you
see the black threads most distinctly in the image, and you will find
the focus of the violet FE, much nearer than that of the red
AC, which plainly shows that bodies of different colours can
never be depicted by convex-lenses, without some degree of confusion.

The quantity of dispersion of the coloured rays in convex lenses
depends upon the focal length of the glass; the space which the
coloured images occupy being about the twenty-eighth part. Thus if
the lens be twenty-eight inches focal distance, the space between
RR and VV (fig 32) will be about one inch; if it
be twenty-eight feet focus, the same space will be about one foot,
and so on in proportion. Now, when such a succession of images formed
by the different coloured rays, is viewed through an eye-glass, it
will seem to form but one image, and consequently very indistinct,
and tinged with various colours, and as the red figure RR is
largest, or seen under the greatest angle--the extreme parts of this
confused image will be red, and a succession of the prismatic colours
will be formed within this red fringe, as is generally found in common
refracting-telescopes, constructed with a single object-glass. It is
owing to this circumstance that the common refracting telescope cannot
be much improved without having recourse to lenses of a very long
focal distance; and hence, about 150 years ago, such telescopes were
constructed of 80, and 100, and 120 feet in length. But still the image
was not formed so distinctly as was desired, and the aperture of the
object-glass was obliged to be limited. This is a defect which was
long regarded as without a remedy; and even Newton himself despaired
of discovering any means by which the defects of refracting telescopes
might be removed and their improvement effected. This, however, was
accomplished by Dollond to an extent far surpassing what could have
been expected, of which a particular account will be given in the
sequel.

It was originally remarked by Newton, and the fact has since
been confirmed by the experiments of Sir W. Herschel, that _the
different-coloured rays have not the same illuminating power_. The
violet rays appear to have the least illuminating effect; the indigo
more, and the effect increases in the order of the colours,--the
_green_ being very great; between the green and the yellow the greatest
of all; the yellow the same as the green; but the red less than the
yellow. Herschel also endeavoured to determine whether the power of the
differently-coloured rays to _heat_ bodies, varied with their power
to illuminate them. He introduced a beam of light into a dark room,
which was decomposed by a prism, and then exposed a very sensible
thermometer to all the rays in succession, and observed the heights
to which it rose in a given time. He found that their heating power
increased from the violet to the red. The mercury in the thermometer
rose higher when its bulb was placed in the Indigo than when it was
placed in the violet, still higher in blue, and highest of all at red.
Upon placing the bulb of the thermometer below the red, quite out of
the spectrum, he was surprised to find that the mercury rose highest
of all; and concluded that _rays proceed from the sun, which have the
power of_ HEATING, _but not of illuminating bodies_. These
rays have been called _invisible_ solar rays. They were about half an
inch from the commencement of the red rays; at a greater distance from
this point the heat began to diminish, but was very perceptible even
at the distance of 1-1/2 inch. He determined that the heating power of
the _red_ to that of the _green_ rays, was 2-3/4 to 1, and 3-1/2 to 1,
in red to _violet_. He afterwards made experiments to collect those
invisible calorific rays, and caused them to act independently of the
light, from which he concluded that they are sufficient to account
for all the effects produced by the solar rays in exciting heat; that
they are capable of passing through glass, and of being refracted and
reflected, after they have been finally detached from the solar beam.

M. Ritter of Jena, Wollaston, Beckman and others, have found
that the rays of the spectrum are possessed of certain _chemical
properties_--that beyond the least brilliant extremity, namely, a
little beyond the _violet_ ray, there are _invisible_ rays which
act chemically, while they have neither the power of heating nor
illuminating bodies. Muriate of silver exposed to the action of the red
rays becomes blackish; a greater effect is produced by the yellow: a
still greater by the violet, and the greatest of all by the _invisible_
rays _beyond_ the violet. When phosphorus is exposed to the action
of the invisible rays beyond the red, it emits white fumes; but the
invisible rays beyond the violet extinguish them. The influence of
these rays is daily seen in the change produced upon vegetable colours,
which fade, when frequently exposed to the direct influence of the sum.
What object they are destined to accomplish in the general economy of
nature, is not yet distinctly known; we cannot however doubt that
they are essentially requisite to various processes going forward in
the material system. And we know that, not only the comfort of all
the tribes of the living world, but the very existence of the animal
and vegetable creation depends upon the unremitting agency of the
_Calorific_ rays.

It has likewise been lately discovered that certain rays of the
spectrum, particularly the _violet, possesses the property of
communicating the magnetic power_. Dr. _Morichini_, of Rome, appears to
have been the first who found that the violet rays of the spectrum had
this property. The result of his experiments, however, was involved in
doubt, till it was established by a series of experiments instituted by
Mrs. _Somerville_, whose name is so well known in the scientific world.
This lady having covered half of a sewing-needle, about an inch long,
with paper, she exposed the other half for two hours, to the violet
rays. The needle had then acquired North polarity. The indigo rays
produced nearly the same effect; and the blue and green rays produced
it in a still less degree. In the yellow, orange, red and invisible
rays, no magnetic influence was exhibited, even though the experiment
was continued for three successive days. The same effects were produced
by enclosing the needle in blue or green glass, or wrapping it in blue
and green ribbands one half of the needle being always covered with
paper.

One of the most curious discoveries of modern times, in reference
to the solar spectrum, is that of Fraunhofer of Munich--one of the
most distinguished artists and opticians on the Continent.[13] He
discovered that the spectrum is covered with dark and coloured lines,
parallel to one another, and perpendicular to the length of the
spectrum; and he counted no less than 590 of these lines. In order
to observe these lines, it is necessary to use prisms of the most
perfect construction, of very pure glass, free of veins--to exclude
all extraneous light, and even to stop those rays which form the
coloured spaces, which we are not examining. It is necessary also to
use a magnifying instrument, and the light must enter and emerge from
the prism at equal angles. One of the important practical results of
this discovery is, that those lines are fixed points in the spectrum,
or rather, that they have always the same position in the coloured
spaces in which they are found. Fraunhofer likewise discovered in the
spectrum produced by the light of Venus, the same streaks, as in the
solar spectrum; in the spectrum of the light of Sirius, he perceived
three large streaks which, according to appearance, had no resemblance
to those of the light of the sun; one of them was in the green, two
in the blue. The stars appear to differ from one another in their
streaks. The electric light differs very much from the light of the sun
and that of a lamp, in regard to the streaks of the spectrum--‘This
experiment may also be made, though in an imperfect manner, by viewing
a narrow slit between two nearly closed window-shutters, through a very
excellent glass prism held close to the eye, with the refracting angle
parallel to the line of light. When the spectrum is formed by the sun’s
rays, either direct or indirect, as from the sky, clouds, rainbow,
moon, or planets, the black bands are always found to be in the same
parts of the spectrum, and under all circumstances to maintain the same
relative position, breadth and intensities.’

From what has been stated in reference to the solar spectrum it will
evidently appear, that white light is nothing else than a compound of
all the prismatic colours; and this may be still farther illustrated
by shewing, that the seven primary colours, when again put together,
recompose white light. This may be rudely proved for the purpose of
illustration, by mixing together seven different powders, having the
colours and proportion of the spectrum; but the best mode, on the
whole, is the following. Let two circles be drawn on a smooth round
board, covered with white paper, as in fig. 34: Let the outermost be
divided into 360 equal parts; then draw seven right lines as A,B,C,
&c., from the center to the outermost circle, making the lines A and
B include 80 degrees of that circle. The lines B and C, 40 degrees; C
and D, 60; D and E, 60; E and F, 48; F and G, 27; G and A, 45. Then
between these two circles paint the space AG red, inclining to orange
near G; GF orange, inclining to yellow near F; FE yellow, inclining to
green near E; ED green, inclining to blue near D; DC blue, inclining to
indigo near C; CB indigo, inclining to violet near B; and BA violet,
inclining to a soft red near A. This done, paint all that part of
the board black which lies within the inner circle; and putting an
axis through the centre of the board, let it be turned swiftly round
that axis, so that the rays proceeding from the above colours, may be
all blended and mixed together in coming to the eye. Then the whole
coloured part will appear like a white ring a little grayish--not
perfectly white, because no art can prepare or lay on perfect colours,
in all their delicate shades, as found in the real spectrum.

[Illustration: _figure 34._]

That all the colours of light, when blended together in their proper
proportions, produce a pure _white_ is rendered certain by the
following experiment. Take a large convex glass, and place it in the
room of the paper or screen on which the solar spectrum was depicted
(LM fig. 31), the glass will unite all the rays which come from the
prism, if a paper is placed to receive them, and you will see a
circular spot of a pure lively white. The rays will cross each other in
the focus of the glass, and, if the paper be removed a little further
from that point, you will see the prismatic colours again displayed,
but in an inverted order, owing to the crossing of the rays.


SECT. 2.--ON THE COLOURS OF NATURAL OBJECTS.

From what has been stated above we may learn the true cause of those
diversified hues exhibited by natural and artificial objects, and the
variegated colouring which appears on the face of nature. It is owing
to the surfaces of bodies being disposed to reflect one colour rather
than another. When this disposition is such that the body reflects
every kind of ray, in the mixed state in which it receives them, that
body appears _white_ to us--which, properly speaking, is no colour,
but rather the assemblage of all colours. If the body has a fitness
to reflect one sort of rays more abundantly than others, by absorbing
all the others, it will appear of the colour belonging to that species
of rays. Thus, the grass is _green_, because it absorbs all the rays
except the green. It is these green rays only which the grass, the
trees, the shrubs, and all the other verdant parts of the landscape
reflect to our sight, and which make them appear green. In the same
manner the different flowers reflect their respective colours; the
rose, the red rays; the violet, the blue; the jonquil, the yellow; the
marigold, the orange, and every object, whether natural or artificial,
appears of that colour which its peculiar texture is fitted to reflect.
A great number of bodies are fitted to reflect at once several kinds
of rays, and of consequence they appear under mixed colours. It may
even happen, that of two bodies which should be green, for example,
one may reflect the pure green of light, and the other the mixture of
yellow and blue. This quality, which varies to infinity, occasions the
different kinds of rays to unite in every possible manner, and every
possible proportion; and hence the inexhaustible variety of shades
and hues which nature has diffused over the landscape of the world.
When a body absorbs nearly all the light which reaches it, that body
appears _black_. It transmits to the eye so few reflected rays that
it is scarcely perceptible in itself, and its presence and form make
no impression upon us, unless as it interrupts the brightness of the
surrounding space. Black is, therefore, the absence of all the coloured
rays.

It is evident, then, that all the various assemblages of colours which
we see in the objects around us, _are not in the bodies themselves_,
but in the light which falls upon them. There is no colour _inherent_
in the grass, the trees, the fruits, and the flowers, nor even in the
most splendid and variegated dress that adorns a lady. All such objects
are as destitute of colour, in themselves, as bodies which are placed
in the centre of the earth, or as the chaotic materials out of which
our globe was formed, before light was created. For where there is no
light, there is no colour. Every object is black, or without colour,
in the dark, and it only appears coloured as soon as light renders it
visible. This is further evident from the following experiment. If we
place a coloured body in one of the colours of the spectrum which is
formed by the prism, it appears of the colour of the rays in which it
is placed. Take, for example, a red rose, and expose it first to the
red rays, and it will appear of a more brilliant ruddy hue. Hold it
in the blue rays, and it appears no longer red, but of a dingy blue
colour, and in like manner its colour will appear different, when
placed in all the other differently coloured rays. This is the reason
why the colours of objects are essentially altered by the nature of
the light in which they are seen. The colours of ribbons and various
pieces of silk or woollen stuff are not the same when viewed by
candle-light as in the day time. In the light of a candle or a lamp,
blue often appears green, and yellow objects assume a whitish aspect.
The reason is that the light of a candle is not so pure a white as that
of the sun, but has a yellowish tinge, and therefore, when refracted
by the prism, the yellowish rays are found to predominate, and the
superabundance of yellow rays gives to blue objects a greenish hue.

The doctrine we are now illustrating is one which a great many persons,
especially among the fair sex, find it difficult to admit. They cannot
conceive it possible that there is no colour really inherent in their
splendid attire, and no tints of beauty in their countenances. ‘What,’
said a certain lady, ‘are there no colours in my shawl, and in the
ribbons that adorn my head-dress--and, are we all as black as negroes
in the dark; I should almost shudder to think of it.’ Such persons,
however, need be in no alarm at the idea; but may console themselves
with the reflection, that, when they are stripped of all their coloured
ornaments in the dark, they are certain that _they will never be seen
by any one_ in that state; and therefore, there is no reason to regret
the temporary loss of those beauties which light creates--when they
themselves and all surrounding objects are _invisible_. But, to give
a still more palpable proof of this position, the following popular
experiments may be stated.

Take a pint of common spirit, and pour it into a soup dish, and then
set it on fire; as it begins to blaze, throw a handful of salt into the
burning spirit, and keep stirring it with a spoon. Several handfuls
may thus be successively thrown in, and then the spectators, standing
around the flame, will see each other frightfully changed, their
colours being altered into a ghastly blackness, in consequence of the
nature of the light which falls upon them--which produces colours very
different from those of the solar light. The following experiment,
as described by Sir D. Brewster, illustrates the same principle.
‘Having obtained the means of illuminating any apartment with _yellow_
light, let the exhibition be made in a room with furniture of various
bright colours, and with oil or water coloured paintings on the wall.
The party which is to witness the experiment should be dressed in a
diversity of the gayest colours; and the brightest coloured flowers,
and highly coloured drawings should be placed on the tables. The room
being at first lighted with ordinary lights, the bright and gay colours
of every thing that it contains will be finely displayed. If the white
lights are now suddenly extinguished, and the yellow lamps lighted,
the most appalling metamorphosis will be exhibited. The astonished
individuals will no longer be able to recognise each other. All the
furniture of the room, and all the objects it contains, will exhibit
only _one_ colour. The flowers will lose their hues; the paintings
and drawings will appear as if they were executed in China ink, and
the gayest dresses, the brightest scarlets, the purest lilacs, the
richest blues and the most vivid greens, will all be converted into one
monotonous yellow. The complexions of the parties, too, will suffer a
corresponding change. One pallid deathlike yellow, will envelope the
young and the old, and the _sallow_ face will alone escape from the
metamorphosis. Each individual derives merriment from the cadaverous
appearance of his neighbour, without being sensible that he is one of
the ghastly assemblage.’

          ----Like the unnatural hue
    Which autumn paints upon the perished leaf,

From such experiments as these we might conclude, that were the solar
rays of a very different description from what they are now found to
be, the colours which embellish the face of nature, and the whole scene
of our sublunary creation would assume a new aspect, and appear very
different from what we now behold around us in every landscape. We find
that the stars display great diversity of colour; which is doubtless
owing to the different kinds of light which are emitted from those
bodies; and hence we may conclude, that the colouring thrown upon the
various objects of the universe is different in every different system,
and that thus, along with other arrangements, an infinite variety of
colouring and of scenery is distributed throughout the immensity of
creation.

The _atmosphere_, in consequence of its different refractive and
reflective powers, is the source of a variety of colours which
frequently embellish and diversify the aspect of our sky. The
air _reflects_ the blue rays most plentifully, and must therefore
_transmit_ the red, orange, and yellow, more copiously than the other
rays. When the sun and other heavenly bodies are at a high elevation,
their light is transmitted without any perceptible change, but when
they are near the horizon, their light must pass through a long and
dense track of air, and must therefore be considerably modified before
it reach the eye of the observer. The momentum of the red rays being
greater than that of the violet, will force their way through the
resisting medium, while the violet rays will be either reflected or
absorbed. If the light of the setting sun, by thus passing through
a long track of air, be divested of the green, blue, indigo, and
violet rays, the remaining rays which are transmitted through the
atmosphere, will illuminate the western clouds, first with an orange
colour; and then, as the sun gradually sinks into the horizon, the
track through which the rays must pass becoming longer, the yellow
and orange are reflected, and the clouds grow more deeply _red_, till
at length the disappearance of the sun leaves them of a leaden hue by
the reflection of the blue light through the air. Similar changes of
colour are sometimes seen on the eastern and western fronts of white
buildings. St. Paul’s Church, in London, is frequently seen at sun-set,
tinged with a very considerable degree of redness; and the same cause
occasions the moon to assume a ruddy colour, by the light transmitted
through the atmosphere. From such atmospherical refractions and
reflections are produced those rich and beautiful hues with which our
sky is gilded by the setting sun, and the glowing red which tinges the
morning and evening clouds, till their ruddy glare is tempered by the
purple of twilight, and the reflected azure of the sky.

When a direct spectrum is thrown on colours darker than itself, it
mixes with them: as the yellow spectrum of the setting sun, thrown on
the green grass, becomes a greener yellow. But when a direct spectrum
is thrown on colours brighter than itself, it becomes instantly changed
into the reverse spectrum, which mixes with those brighter colours.
Thus the yellow spectrum of the setting sun thrown on the luminous
sky, becomes blue, and changes with the colour or brightness of the
clouds on which it appears. The red part of light being capable of
struggling through thick and resisting mediums which intercept all
other colours--is likewise the cause why the sun appears red when seen
through a fog,--why distant light, though transmitted through blue
or green glass, appears red--why lamps at a distance, seen through
the smoke of a long street, are red, while those that are near, are
white. To the same cause it is owing that a diver at the bottom of the
sea is surrounded with the red light which has pierced through the
superincumbent fluid, and that the blue rays are reflected from the
_surface_ of the ocean. Hence, Dr. Halley informs us that, when he was
in a diving bell, at the bottom of the sea, his hand always appeared
red in the water.

The _blue_ rays, as already noticed, being unable to resist the
obstructions they meet with in their course through the atmosphere, are
either reflected or absorbed in their passage. It is to this cause,
that most philosophers ascribe _the blue colour of the sky_, the
faintness and obscurity of distant objects, and the bright azure which
tinges the mountains of a distant landscape.


SECT. 3.--PHENOMENA OF THE RAINBOW.

Since the rays of light are found to be decomposed by refracting
surfaces, and reflected in an infinite variety of modes and shades
of colour, we need not be surprised at the changes produced in any
scene or object by the intervention of another, and by the numerous
modifications of which the primary colours of nature are susceptible.
The vivid colours which gild the rising and the setting sun, must
necessarily differ from those which adorn its noon-day splendour.
Variety of atmospheric scenery will thus necessarily be produced,
greater than the most lively fancy can well imagine. The clouds will
sometimes assume the most fantastic forms, and at other times will be
irradiated with beams of light, or, covered with the darkest hues, will
assume a lowering aspect, prognostive of the thunder’s roar and the
lightning’s flash--all in accordance with the different rays that are
reflected to our eyes, or the quantity absorbed by the vapours which
float in the atmosphere.

Light, which embellishes with so much magnificence a pure and serene
sky, by means of innumerable bright starry orbs which are spread over
it, sometimes, in a dark and cloudy sky, exhibits an ornament which,
by its pomp, splendour and variety of colours, attracts the attention
of every eye that has an opportunity of beholding it. At certain
times, when there is a shower either around us, or at a distance from
us in an opposite quarter to that of the sun, a species of arch or
bow is seen in the sky, adorned with all the seven primary colours of
light. This phenomenon, which is one of the most beautiful meteors in
nature, has obtained the name of the RAINBOW. The rainbow was,
for ages, considered as an inexplicable mystery, and by some nations
it was adored as a deity. Even after the dawn of true philosophy,
it was a considerable time before any discovery of importance was
made, as to the true causes which operate in the production of this
phenomenon. About the year 1571, M. Fletcher of Breslau, made a certain
approximation to the discovery of the true cause, by endeavouring to
account for the colours of the rainbow by means of a double refraction
and one reflection. A nearer approximation was made by Antonio de
Dominis, bishop of Spalatro, about 1601. He maintained that the
double refraction of Fletcher, _with an intervening reflection_,
was sufficient to produce the colours of the bow, and also to bring
the rays that formed them to the eye of the spectator, without any
subsequent reflection. To verify this hypothesis, he procured a small
globe of solid glass, and viewing it when it was exposed to the rays
of the sun--with his back to that luminary--in the same manner as he
had supposed the drops of rain were situated with respect to them, he
observed the same colours which he had seen in the rainbow, and in
the same order. But he could give no good reason _why_ the bow should
be coloured, and much less any satisfactory account of the _order_ in
which the colours appear. It was not till Sir I. Newton discovered
the different refrangibility of the rays of light, that a complete
and satisfactory explanation could be given of all the circumstances
connected with this phenomenon.

As the full elucidation of this subject involves a variety of optical
and mathematical investigations, I shall do little more than explain
the general principle on which the prominent phenomena of the rainbow
may be accounted for, and some of the facts and results which theory
and observation have deduced.

We have just now alluded to an experiment with a glass globe:--If,
then, we take either a solid glass globe, or a hollow globe filled with
water, and suspend it so high in the solar rays above the eye, that
the spectator, with his back to the sun, can see the globe _red_;--if
it be lowered slowly, he will see it orange, then yellow, then green,
then blue, then indigo, and then violet; so that the drop at different
heights, shall present to the eye the seven primitive colours in
succession. In this case, the globe, from its form, will act in some
measure like a prism, and the ray will be separated into its component
parts. The following figure will more particularly illustrate this
point. Suppose A (fig. 35.) to represent a drop of rain--which may be
considered as a globe of glass in miniature, and will produce the same
effect on the rays of light--and let SD represent a ray from
the sun falling upon the upper part of the drop at D. At the
point of entering the drop, it will suffer a refraction, and instead
of going forward to C, it will be bent to N. From
N a part of the light will be reflected to Q--some
part of it will, of course, pass through the drop. By the obliquity
with which it falls on the side of the drop at Q, that part
becomes a kind of prism, and separates the ray into its primitive
colours. It is found by computation that, after a ray has suffered
two refractions and one reflection, as here represented, the least
refrangible part of it, namely the _red_ ray, will make an angle with
the incident solar ray of 42° 2´, as SFQ; and the violet, or
greatest refrangible ray will make with the solar ray, an angle of 40°
17´, as SCQ; and thus all the particles of water within the
difference of those two angles, namely 1° 45´--(supposing the ray to
proceed merely from the centre of the sun)--will exhibit severally the
colours of the prism, and constitute the _interior_ bow of the cloud.
This holds good at whatever height the sun may chance to be in a shower
of rain. If he be at a high altitude, the rainbow will be low; if he be
at a low elevation, the rainbow must be high; and if a shower happen
in a vale, when the spectator is on a mountain, he will sometimes see
the bow in the form of a _complete circle_ below him. We have at
present described the phenomena only of a single drop; but it is to be
considered that in a shower of rain there are drops at all heights and
at all distances; and therefore the eye situated at G will see all the
different colours. All those drops that are in a certain position with
respect to the spectator will reflect the red rays, all those in the
next station the orange, those in the next the green, and so on with
regard to all the other colours.

[Illustration: _figure 35._]

It appears, then, that the first or primary bow is formed by two
refractions and one reflection; but there is frequently a second bow,
on the outside of the other, which is considerably fainter. This is
produced by drops of rain above the drop we have supposed at A. If B
(fig. 35.) represent one of these drops, the ray to be sent to the eye
enters the drop near the bottom, and suffers _two refractions_ and _two
reflections_, by which means the colours become reversed, that is, the
violet is lowest in the _exterior_ bow, and the red is lowest in the
_interior_ one, and the other colours are reversed accordingly. The ray
T is refracted at R: a part of it is reflected from S
to T, and at T it suffers another reflection from
T to U. At the points S and T part
of the ray _passes through_ the drop on account of its transparency,
towards W and X, and therefore we say that _part_
only of the ray is reflected. By these losses and reflections the
exterior bow becomes faint and ill-defined in comparison of the
interior or primary bow. In this case the upper part of the secondary
bow will not be seen when the sun is above 54° 10´ above the horizon;
and the lower part of the bow will not be seen when the sun is 60° 58´
above the horizon.

[Illustration: _figure 36._]

For the further illustrations of this subject, we may introduce the
following section of a bow, (fig. 36.) and, in order to prevent
confusion in attempting to represent all the different colours--let
us suppose only three drops of rain, and three different colours, as
shown in the figure. The spectator O being in the centre of the two
bows, here represented,--the planes of which must be considered as
perpendicular to his view--the drops A,B, and C produce part of the
interior bow by two refractions and one reflection as stated above,
and the drops D,E,F will produce the exterior bow by two refractions
and two reflections, the sun’s rays being represented by 3,3. It is
evident that the angle COP is less than the angle BOP, and that the
angle AOP is the greatest of the three. The largest angle, then, is
formed by the red rays, the middle one consists of the green, and the
smallest the purple or violet. All the drops of rain, therefore, that
happen to be in a certain position with respect to the spectator’s eye,
will reflect the red rays, and form a band or semicircle of red, and so
of the other colours from drops in other positions. If the spectator
alters his station, he will see a bow, but not the same as before; and
if there be many spectators, they will each see a different bow, though
it appears to be the same.

The rainbow assumes a _semicircular_ appearance, because it is only at
certain angles that the refracted rays are visible to our eyes, as is
evident from the experiment of the glass globe formerly alluded to,
which will refract the rays only in a certain position. We have already
stated that the red rays make an angle of 42° 2´, and the violet
an angle of 40° 17´. Now, if a line be drawn horizontally from the
spectator’s eye, it is evident that angles formed with this line, of a
certain dimension, in every direction, will produce a circle, as will
appear by attaching a cord of a given length to a certain point, round
which it may turn as round its axis; and, in every point will describe
an angle with the horizontal line of a certain and determinate extent.

Sometimes it happens that _three_ or more bows are visible, though
with different degrees of distinctness. I have more than once observed
this phenomenon, particularly in Edinburgh, in the month of August,
1825, when three rainbows were distinctly seen in the same quarter
of the sky; and, if I recollect right, a fragment of a fourth made
its appearance. This happens when the rays suffer a third or fourth
reflection; but, on account of the light lost by so many reflections,
such bows are, for the most part, altogether imperceptible.

If there were no ground to intercept the rain and the view of the
observer, the rainbow would form a _complete circle_, the centre
of which is diametrically opposite to the sun. Such circles are
sometimes seen in the spray of the sea or of a cascade, or from the
tops of lofty mountains, when the showers happen in the vales below.
Rainbows of various descriptions are frequently observed rising amidst
the spray and exhalations of waterfalls, and among the waves of the
sea whose tops are blown by the wind into small drops. There is one
regularly seen, when the sun is shining, and the spectator in a proper
position, at the fall of Staubbach, in the bosom of the Alps; one near
Schaffhausen; one at the cascade of Lauffen; and one at the cataract of
Niagara in North America. A still more beautiful one is said to be seen
at Terni, where the whole current of the river Velino, rushing from
a steep precipice of nearly 200 feet high, presents to the spectator
below, a variegated circle, over-arching the fall, and two other bows
suddenly reflected on the right and left. Don Ulloa, in the account
of his journeys in South America, relates that circular rainbows are
frequently seen on the mountains above Quito in Peru. It is said that
a rainbow was once seen near London, caused by the exhalations of
that city, after the sun had been below the horizon more than twenty
minutes.[14] A naval friend, says Mr. Bucke, informed me, that, as he
was one day watching the sun’s effect upon the exhalations near Juan
Fernandez, he saw upwards of five-and-twenty _ires marinæ_ animate
the sea at the same time. In these marine bows the concave sides were
turned upwards, the drops of water rising from below, and not falling
from above, as in the instances of the aerial arches. Rainbows are also
occasionally seen on the grass, in the morning dew, and likewise when
the hoar-frost is descending. Dr. Langwith once saw a bow lying on the
ground, the colours of which were almost as lively as those of a common
rainbow. It was not round but oblong, and was extended several hundred
yards. The colours took up less space, and were much more lively in
those parts of the bow which were near him than in those which were
at a distance. When M. Labillardiere was on Mount Teneriffe, he saw
the contours of his body traced on the clouds beneath him in all the
colours of the solar bow. He had previously witnessed this phenomenon
on the Kesrouan in Asia Minor. The rainbows of Greenland are said to
be frequently of a pale white, fringed with a brownish yellow, arising
from the rays of the sun being reflected from a frozen cloud.

The following is a summary view of the principal facts which have been
ascertained respecting the rainbow:--1. The rainbow can only be seen
when it rains, and in that point of the heavens which is opposite to
the sun. 2. Both the primary and secondary bows are variegated with all
the prismatic colours--the red being the highest colour in the primary,
or brightest bow, and the violet the highest in the exterior. 3. The
primary rainbow can never be a greater arc than a semicircle; and
when the sun is set, no bow, in ordinary circumstances, can be seen.
4. The breadth of the inner or primary bow--supposing the sun but a
point--is 1° 45´; and the breadth of the exterior bow 3° 12´, which is
nearly twice as great as that of the other; and the distance between
the bows is 8° 55´. But since the body of the sun subtends an angle of
about half a degree, by so much will each bow be increased, and their
distance diminished; and therefore the breadth of the interior bow
will be 2° 15´, and that of the exterior, 3° 42´, and their distance
8° 25´. The greatest semidiameter of the interior bow, on the same
grounds, will be 42° 17´, and the least of the exterior bow 50° 43´.
5. When the sun is in the horizon, either in the morning or evening,
the bows will appear complete semicircles. On the other hand, when the
sun’s altitude is equal to 42° 2´ or to 54° 10´, the summits of the
bows will be depressed below the horizon. Hence, during the days of
summer, within a certain interval each day, no visible rainbows can be
formed, on account of the sun’s high altitude above the horizon. 6.
The altitude of the bows above the horizon, or surface of the earth,
varies, according to the elevation of the sun. The altitude, at any
time, may be taken by a common quadrant, or other angular instrument;
but, if the sun’s altitude at any particular time be known, the height
of the summit of any of the bows may be found, by subtracting the sun’s
altitude from 42° 2´ for the inner bow, and from 54° 10´, for the
outer. Thus, if the sun’s altitude were 26°, the height of the primary
bow would 16° 2´, and of the secondary, 28° 10´. It follows, that the
height and the size of the bows diminish as the altitude of the sun
increases. 7. If the sun’s altitude is more than 42 degrees, and less
than 54°, the exterior bow may be seen though the interior bow is
invisible. 8. Sometimes only a portion of an arch will be visible while
all the other parts of the bow are invisible. This happens when the
rain does not occupy a space of sufficient extent to complete the bow;
and the appearance of this position, and even of the bow itself, will
be various, according to the nature of the situation, and the space
occupied by the rain.

The appearance of the rainbow may be produced by artificial means, at
any time when the sun is shining and not too highly elevated above the
horizon. This is effected by means of artificial fountains or _Jet
d’eaus_, which are intended to throw up streams of water to a great
height. These streams, when they spread very wide, and blend together
in their upper parts, form, when falling, a shower of artificial rain.
If, then, when the fountain is playing, we move between it and the sun,
at a proper distance from the fountain, till our shadow point directly
towards it, and look at the shower,--we shall observe the colours of
the rainbow, strong and vivid; and, what is particularly worthy of
notice, the bow appears, notwithstanding the nearness of the shower, to
be as large, and as far off, as the rainbow which we see in a natural
shower of rain. The same experiment may be made by candle-light, and
with any instrument that will form an artificial shower.

_Lunar Rainbows._--A lunar bow is sometimes formed at night by the rays
of the moon striking on a rain-cloud, especially when she is about
the full. But such a phenomenon is very rare. Aristotle is said to
have considered himself the first who had seen a lunar rainbow. For
more than a hundred years prior to the middle of the last century, we
find only two or three instances recorded in which such phenomena are
described with accuracy. In the philosophical transactions for 1783,
however, we have an account of three having been seen in one year,
and all in the same place, but they are by no means common phenomena.
I have had an opportunity within the last twenty years of witnessing
two phenomena of this description--one of which was seen at Perth, on
a sabbath evening, in the autumn of 1825, and the other at Edinburgh,
on Wednesday, the 9th of September 1840, about eight o’clock in the
evening--of both which I gave a detailed description in some of the
public journals. The Moon, in both cases, was within a day or two of
the full; the arches were seen in the northern quarter of the heavens,
and extended nearly from east to west, the moon being not far from the
southern meridian. The bows appeared distinct and well defined, but no
distinct traces of the prismatic colours could be perceived on any of
them. That which appeared in 1825 was the most distinctly formed, and
continued visible for more than an hour. The other was much fainter,
and lasted little more than half an hour, dark clouds having obscured
the face of the moon. These bows bore a certain resemblance to some
of the luminous arches which sometimes accompany the Aurora Borealis,
and this latter phenomenon has not unfrequently been mistaken for a
Lunar rainbow; but they may be always distinguished by attending to the
phases and position of the moon. If the moon be not visible above the
horizon, if she be in her first or last quarter, or if any observed
phenomenon be not in a direction opposite to the moon, we may conclude
with certainty that, whatever appearance is presented, there is no
lunar rainbow.

The rainbow is an object which has engaged universal attention, and
its beautiful colours and form have excited universal admiration. The
poets have embellished their writings with many beautiful allusions
to this splendid meteor; and the playful school-boy, while viewing
the ‘bright enchantment,’ has frequently run ‘to catch the falling
glory.’ When its arch rests on the opposite sides of a narrow valley,
or on the summits of two adjacent mountains, its appearance is both
beautiful and grand. In all probability, its figure first suggested the
idea of _arches_, which are now found of so much utility in forming
aqueducts and bridges, and for adorning the architecture of palaces and
temples. It is scarcely possible seriously to contemplate this splendid
phenomenon, without feeling admiration and gratitude towards that wise
and beneficent Being, whose hands have bent it into so graceful and
majestic a form, and decked it with all the pride of colours. “Look
upon the rainbow,” says the son of Sirach,[15] and praise Him that
made it: very beautiful it is in the brightness thereof. It compasseth
the heaven about with a glorious circle, and the hands of the Most
High have bended it." To this grand etherial bow, the inspired writers
frequently allude as one of the emblems of the majesty and splendour
of the Almighty. In the prophecies of Ezekiel, the throne of Deity is
represented as adorned with a brightness “like the appearance of the
bow that is in the cloud in the day of rain--the appearance of the
likeness of the glory of Jehovah.” And, in the visions recorded in the
Book of the Revelations, where the Most High is represented as sitting
upon a throne; “there was a rainbow round about the throne, in sight
like unto an emerald,” as an emblem of his propitious character and of
his faithfulness and mercy. After the deluge, this bow was appointed as
a sign and memorial of the covenant which God made with Noah and his
sons, that a flood of waters should never again be permitted to deluge
the earth and its inhabitants;--and as a pledge of inviolable fidelity
and Divine benignity. When, therefore, we at any time behold “the bow
in the cloud,” we have not only a beautiful and sublime phenomenon
presented to the eye of sense, but also a memorial exhibited to the
mental eye, assuring us, that, “While the earth remaineth, seed-time
and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and
night, _shall not cease_.”[16]

                    ----On the broad sky is seen
    “A dewy cloud, and in the cloud a bow
    Conspicuous, with seven listed colours gay
    Betokening peace with God and covenant new.--
    He gives a promise never to destroy
    The earth again by flood, nor let the sea
    Surpass his bounds, nor rain to drown the world.”
                          _Milton. Par. Lost, Book XI._


SECT. 4.--REFLECTIONS ON THE BEAUTY AND UTILITY OF COLOURS.

Colour is one of the properties of light which constitutes, chiefly,
the beauty and sublimity of the universe. It is colour, in all its
diversified shades, which presents to our view that almost infinite
variety of aspect which appears on the scene of nature, which gives
delight to the eye and the imagination, and which adds a fresh pleasure
to every new landscape we behold. Every flower which decks our fields
and gardens is compounded of different hues; every plain is covered
with shrubs and trees of different degrees of verdure; and almost every
mountain is clothed with herbs and grass of different shade from those
which appear on the hills and landscape with which it is surrounded.
In the country, during summer, nature is every day, and almost every
hour, varying her appearance, by the multitude and variety of her hues
and decorations, so that the eye wanders with pleasure over objects
continually diversified, and extending as far as the sight can reach.
In the flowers with which every landscape is adorned, what a lovely
assemblage of colours, and what a wonderful art in the disposition of
their shades! Here, a light pencil seems to have laid on the delicate
tints; there, they are blended according to the nicest rules of art.
Although green is the general colour which prevails over the scene
of sublunary nature, yet it is diversified by a thousand different
shades, so that every species of tree, shrub and herb, is clothed
with its own peculiar verdure. The dark green of the forests is thus
easily distinguished from the lighter shades of cornfields and the
verdure of the lawns. The system of animated nature likewise, displays
a diversified assemblage of beautiful colours. The plumage of birds,
the brilliant feathers of the peacock, the ruby and emerald hues which
adorn the little humming-bird, and the various embellishments of many
species of the insect tribe, present to the eye, in every region of
the globe, a scene of diversified beauty and embellishment. Nor is
the mineral kingdom destitute of such embellishments. For some of the
darkest and most unshapely stones and pebbles, when polished by the
hand of art, display a mixture of the most delicate and variegated
colours. All which beauties and varieties in the scene around us are
entirely owing to that property, in every ray of light, by which it is
capable of being separated into the primitive colours.

To the same cause, likewise, are to be ascribed those beautiful and
diversified appearances, which frequently adorn the face of the
sky,--the yellow, orange and ruby hues which embellish the firmament
at the rising of the sun, and when he is about to descend below the
western horizon; and those aerial landscapes, so frequently beheld in
tropical climes, where rivers, castles and mountains, are depicted
rolling over each other along the circle of the horizon. The clouds,
especially in some countries, reflect almost every colour in nature.
Sometimes they wear the modest blush of the rose; sometimes they appear
like stripes of deep vermillion, and sometimes as large brilliant
masses tinged with various hues; now they are white as ivory, and now
as yellow as native gold. In some tropical countries, according to St.
Pierre, the clouds roll themselves up into enormous masses as white as
snow, and are piled upon each other, like the Cordeliers of Peru, and
are moulded into the shape of mountains, of caverns and of rocks. When
the sun sets behind this magnificent aërial net-work, a multitude of
luminous rays are transmitted through each particular interstice, which
produce such an effect, that the two sides of the lozenge illuminated
by them, have the appearance of being begirt with a fillet of gold;
and the other two which are in the shade, seem tinged with a superb
ruddy orange. Four or five divergent streams of light, emanating from
the setting sun up to the zenith, clothe with fringes of gold the
undeterminate summits of this celestial barrier, and proceed to strike
with the reflexes of their fires the pyramids of the collateral aerial
mountains, which then appear to consist of silver and vermilion.--In
short, colour diversifies every sublunary scene, whether on the earth
or in the atmosphere, it imparts a beauty to the phenomena of falling
stars, of luminous arches, and the coruscations of the Aurora Borealis,
and gives a splendour and sublimity to the spacious vault of heaven.

Let us now consider for a moment, what would be the aspect of nature,
if, instead of the beautiful variety of embellishments which now
appear on every landscape, and on the concave of the sky,--_one_
uniform colour had been thrown over the scenery of the universe. Let
us conceive the whole of terrestrial nature to be covered with snow,
so that not an object on earth should appear with any other hue, and
that the vast expanse of the firmament presented precisely the same
uniform aspect. What would be the consequence? The light of the sun
would be strongly reflected from all the objects within the bounds of
our horizon, and would produce a lustre which would dazzle every eye.
The day would acquire a greater _brightness_ than it now exhibits,
and our eyes might, after some time, be enabled freely to expatiate
over the surrounding landscape; but every thing, though enlightened,
would appear _confused_, and particular objects would scarcely be
distinguishable. A tree, a house or a church, near at hand, might
possibly be distinguished, on account of its elevation above the
general surface of the ground, and the bed of a river by reason of its
being depressed below it. But we should be obliged rather to guess,
and to form a conjecture as to the particular object we wished to
distinguish, than to arrive at any certain conclusion respecting it;
and if it lay at a considerable distance, it would be impossible, with
any degree of probability, to discriminate any one object from another.
Notwithstanding the universal brightness of the scene, the uniformity
of colour thrown on every object, would most certainly prevent us from
distinguishing a church from a palace, a cottage from a knoll or a
heap of rubbish, a splendid mansion from rugged rocks, the trees from
the hills on which they grow, or a barren desert from rich and fertile
plains. In such a case, human beings would be confounded, and even
friends and neighbours be at a loss to recognize one another.

The vault of heaven, too, would wear a uniform aspect. Neither planets
nor comets would be visible to any eye, nor those millions of stars
which now shine forth with so much brilliancy, and diversify the
nocturnal sky. For, it is by the contrast produced by the deep azure
of the heavens and the white radiance of the stars, that those bodies
are rendered visible. Were they depicted on a pure white ground, they
would not be distinguished from that ground, and would consequently be
invisible, unless any of them occasionally assumed a different colour.
Of course, all that beautiful variety of aspect which now appears on
the face of sublunary nature--the rich verdure of the fields, the
stately port of the forest, the rivers meandering through the valleys,
the splendid hues that diversify and adorn our gardens and meadows, the
gay colouring of the morning and evening clouds, and all that variety
which distinguishes the different seasons, would entirely disappear. As
every landscape would exhibit nearly the same aspect, there would be no
inducement to the poet and the philosopher to visit distant countries
to investigate the scenes of nature, and journeyings from one region
to another would scarcely be productive of enjoyment. Were any other
single colour to prevail, nearly the same results would ensue. Were a
deep ruddy hue to be uniformly spread over the scene of creation, it
would not only be offensive to the eye, but would likewise prevent all
distinction of objects. Were a dark blue or a deep violet to prevail,
it would produce a similar effect, and at the same time, present the
scene of nature as covered with a dismal gloom. Even if creation were
arrayed in a robe of _green_, which is a more pleasant colour to the
eye--were it not diversified with the different shades it now exhibits,
every object would be equally undistinguishable.

Such would have been the aspect of creation, and the inconveniences
to which we should have been subjected, had the Creator afforded us
light without that intermixture of colours which now appears over all
nature, and which serves to discriminate one object from another. Even
our very apartments would have been tame and insipid, incapable of
the least degree of ornament, and the articles with which they are
furnished, almost undistinguishable, so that in discriminating one
object from another, we should have been as much indebted to the sense
of touch as to the sense of vision. Our friends and fellow men would
have presented no objects of interest in our daily associations. The
sparkling eye, the benignant smile, the modest blush, the blended
hues of white and vermillion in the human face, and the beauty of
the female countenance, would all have vanished, and we should have
appeared to one another as so many moving marble statues cast nearly
in the same mould. But, what would have been worst of all, the
numerous delays, uncertainties and perplexities to which we should
have been subjected, had we been under the necessity, every moment, of
distinguishing objects by trains of reasoning, and by circumstances
of time, place, and relative position? An artist, when commencing his
work in the morning, with a hundred tools of nearly the same size and
shape around him, would have spent a considerable portion of his time
before he could have selected those proper for his purpose, or the
objects to which they were to be applied; and in every department of
society, and in all our excursions from one place to another, similar
difficulties and perplexities would have occurred. The one half of our
time must thus have been employed in uncertain guesses, and perplexing
reasonings, respecting the real nature and individuality of objects,
rather than in a regular train of thinking and of employment; and after
all our perplexities and conjectures, we must have remained in the
utmost uncertainty, as to the thousands of scenes and objects, which
are now obvious to us, through the instrumentality of colours, as soon
as we open our eyes.

In short, without colour, we could have had no books nor writings:
we could neither have corresponded with our friends by letters, nor
have known any thing with certainty, of the events which happened in
former ages. No written revelation of the will of God, and of his
character, such as we now enjoy, could have been handed down to us
from remote periods and generations. The discoveries of science, and
the improvements of art, would have remained unrecorded. Universal
ignorance would have prevailed throughout the world, and the human mind
have remained in a state of demoralization and debasement. All these,
and many other inconveniences and evils would have inevitably followed,
had not God painted the rays of light with a diversity of colours,
And hence we may learn, that the most important scenes and events in
the universe, may depend upon the existence of a single principle in
nature, and even upon the most minute circumstances, which we may be
apt to overlook, in the arrangements of the material world.

In the existing state of things in the visible creation, we cannot but
admire the Wisdom and Beneficence of the Deity, in thus enabling us
to distinguish objects by so easy and expeditious a mode as _that of
colour_, which in a moment, discriminates every object and its several
relations. We rise in the morning to our respective employments,
and our food, our drink, our tools, our books, and whatever is
requisite for our comfort, are at once discriminated. Without the
least hesitation or uncertainty, and without any perplexing process
of reasoning, we can lay our hands on whatever articles we require.
Colour clothes every object with its peculiar livery, and infallibly
directs the hand in its movements, and the eye in its surveys and
contemplations. But, this is not the only end which the Divine
Being had in view, in impressing on the rays of light a diversity
of colours. It is evident, that he likewise intended to minister to
our _pleasures_, as well as to our wants. To every man of taste, and
almost to every human being, the combination of colours in flowers, the
delicate tints with which they are painted, the diversified shades of
green with which the hills and dales, the mountains and the vales are
arrayed; and that beautiful variety which appears in a bright summer
day, on all the objects of this lower creation--are sources of the
purest enjoyment and delight. It is colour, too, as well as magnitude,
that adds to the _sublimity_ of objects. Were the canopy of heaven of
one uniform hue, it would fail in producing those lofty conceptions,
and those delightful and transporting emotions, which a contemplation
of its august scenery is calculated to inspire. Colours are likewise of
considerable utility in the intercourse of general society. They serve
both for ornaments, and for distinguishing the different ranks and
conditions of the community: they add to the beauty and gracefulness
of our furniture and clothing. At a glance, they enable us at once to
distinguish the noble from the ignoble, the prince from his subjects,
the master from his servant, and the widow clothed with sable weeds
from the bride adorned with her nuptial ornaments.

Since colours, then, are of so much value and importance, they may
be reckoned as holding a rank among the noblest natural gifts of the
Creator. As they are of such essential service to the inhabitants of
our globe, there can be no doubt that they serve similar or analogous
purposes throughout all the worlds in the universe. The colours
displayed in the solar beams are common to all the globes which
compose the planetary system, and must necessarily be reflected, in
all their diversified hues, from objects on their surfaces. The light
which radiates from the fixed stars displays a similar diversity of
colours. Some of the double stars are found to emit light of different
hues;--the larger star exhibiting light of a ruddy or orange hue,
and the smaller one a radiance which approaches to blue or green.
There is therefore reason to conclude, that the objects connected
with the planets which revolve round such stars--being occasionally
enlightened by suns of different hues--will display a more variegated
and splendid scenery of colouring than is ever beheld in the world on
which we dwell; and that one of the distinguishing characteristics of
different worlds, in regard to their embellishments, may consist in
the splendour and variety of colours with which the objects on their
surfaces are adorned. In the metaphorical description of the glories
of the New Jerusalem, recorded in the Book of Revelation, one of the
chief characteristics of that city is said to consist in the splendour
and diversity of hues with which it is adorned. It is represented
as “coming down from heaven, _prepared as a bride adorned for her
husband_,” and as reflecting all the beautiful and variegated colours
which the finest gems on earth can exhibit; evidently indicating, that
splendour and variety of colouring are some of the grandest features of
celestial scenery.

On the whole, the subject of colours, when seriously considered,
is calculated to excite us to the adoration of the goodness and
intelligence of that Almighty Being whose wisdom planned all the
arrangements of the universe, and to inspire us with gratitude for the
numerous conveniences and pleasures we derive from those properties and
laws he has impressed on the material system. He might have afforded
us light, and even splendid illumination, without the pleasures
and advantages which diversified colours now produce, and man and
other animated beings might have existed in such a state. But, what
a very different scene would the world have presented from what it
now exhibits! Of how many thousands of pleasures should we have been
deprived! and to what numerous inconveniences and perplexities should
we have been subjected! The sublimity and glories of the firmament, and
the endless beauties and varieties which now embellish our terrestrial
system, would have been for ever unknown, and man could have had little
or no incitement to study and investigate the works of his Creator.
In this, as well as in many other arrangements in nature, we have a
sensible proof of the presence and agency of that Almighty Intelligence
“in whom we live, and move, and have our being.” None but an infinitely
Wise and Beneficent Being, intimately present in all places, could
thus so regularly create in us by means of colour, those exquisite
sensations which afford so much delight, and which unite us, as it
were, with every thing around us. In the diversity of hues spread
over the face of creation, we have as real a display of the Divine
presence as Moses enjoyed at the burning bush. The only difference
is, that the one was out of the common order of Divine procedure, and
the other in accordance with those permanent laws which regulate the
economy of the universe. In every colour, then, which we contemplate,
we have a sensible memorial of the presence of that Being “whose
Spirit garnished the heavens and laid the foundations of the earth,”
and whose “merciful visitation” sustains us every moment in existence.
But the revelation of God to our senses, through the various objects
of the material world, has become so familiar, that we are apt to
forget the Author of all our enjoyments, even at the moment when we
are investigating his works and participating of his benefits. “O that
men would praise Jehovah for his goodness, and for his wonderful works
towards the children of men.”




PART II.

ON TELESCOPES.




CHAPTER I.


HISTORY OF THE INVENTION OF TELESCOPES.

The telescope is an optical instrument for viewing objects at a
distance. Its name is compounded of two Greek words,--τηλε, which
signifies, _at a distance_, or _far off_, and σχοπειν, _to view_, or to
_contemplate_. By means of telescopes, remote objects are represented
as if they were near, small apparent magnitudes are enlarged, confused
objects are rendered distinct, and the invisible and obscure parts of
very distant scenes are rendered perceptible and clear to the organ
of vision. The telescope is justly considered as a grand and noble
instrument. It is not a little surprising that it should be in the
power of man to invent and construct an instrument by which objects,
too remote for the unassisted eye to distinguish, should be brought
within the range of distinct vision, as if they were only a few yards
from our eye, and that thousands of august objects in the heavens,
which had been concealed from mortals for numerous ages, should be
brought within the limits of our contemplation, and be as distinctly
perceived, as if we had been transported many millions of miles from
the space we occupy, through the celestial regions. The celebrated
Huygens remarks, in reference to this instrument, that, in his opinion,
‘the wit and industry of man has not produced any thing so noble and
so worthy of his faculties as this sort of knowledge; (namely of the
telescope) insomuch that if any particular person had been so diligent
and sagacious as to invent this instrument from the principles of
nature and geometry,--for my part, I should have thought his abilities
were more than human; but the case is so far from this, that the most
learned men have not yet been able sufficiently to explain the reason
of the effects of this casual invention.’

The persons who constructed the first telescopes, and the exact
period when they were first invented, are involved in some degree of
obscurity. It does not certainly appear that such instruments were
known to the ancients, although we ought not to be perfectly decisive
on this point. The cabinets of the curious contain some very ancient
gems, of admirable workmanship, the figures on which are so small,
that they appear beautiful through a magnifying glass, but altogether
confused and indistinct to the naked eye: and, therefore, it may
be asked, if they cannot be _viewed_, how could they _be wrought_,
without the assistance of glasses? And as some of the ancients have
declared that the moon has a form like that of the earth, and has
plains, hills, and valleys in it,--how could they know this--unless by
mere conjecture, without the use of a telescope? And how could they
have known that the _Milky Way_ is formed by the combined rays of an
infinite number of stars? For Ovid states, in reference to this zone,
‘its ground-work is of stars.’ But whatever knowledge the ancients may
have possessed of the telescope or other optical glasses, it is quite
evident that they never had telescopes of such size and power as those
which we now possess; and that no discoveries in the heavens, such as
are now brought to light, were made by any of the ancient astronomers;
otherwise some allusions to them must have been found in their writings.

Among the moderns, the illustrious Friar Bacon appears to have acquired
some rude ideas respecting the construction of telescopes. ‘Lenses and
specula’ says he, ‘may be so figured that one object may be multiplied
into many, that those which are situated at a great distance may be
made to appear very near, that those which are small may be made to
appear very large, and those which are obscure very plain; and we can
make stars to appear wherever we will.’ From these expressions, it
appears highly probable, that this philosopher was acquainted with
the general principle both of telescopes and microscopes, and that he
may have constructed telescopes of small magnifying power, for his
own observation and amusement, although they never came into general
use. He was a man of extensive learning, and made so rapid a progress
in the sciences, when attending the university of Paris, that he
was esteemed the glory of that seat of learning. He prosecuted his
favourite study of experimental philosophy with unremitting ardour; and
in this pursuit, in the course of twenty years, he expended no less
than £2000 in experiments, instruments, and in procuring scarce books.
In consequence of such extraordinary talents, and such astonishing
progress in the sciences, in that ignorant age, he was represented,
by the envy of his illiterate fraternity, as having dealings with
the devil; and, under this pretence, he was restrained from reading
lectures, and at length, in 1278, when sixty-four years of age, he was
imprisoned in his cell, where he remained in confinement for ten years.
He shone like a single bright star in a dark hemisphere--the glory of
our country--and died at Oxford, in the year 1294, in the eightieth
year of his age. ‘Friar Bacon,’ says the Rev. Mr. Jones, ‘may be
considered as the first of English philosophers; his profound skill in
mechanics, optics, astronomy, and chemistry, would make an honourable
figure in the present age. But he is entitled to further praise, as
he made all his studies subservient to theology, and directed all his
writings, as much as could be, to the glory of God. He had the highest
regard for the sacred scriptures, and was persuaded they contain the
principles of all true science.’

The next person who is supposed to have acquired a knowledge of
telescopes, was Joannes Baptista Porta, of Naples, who flourished
in the sixteenth century. He discovered the _Camera Obscura_--the
knowledge of which might naturally have led to the invention of the
telescope; but it does not appear that he ever constructed such an
instrument. Des Cartes considers James Metius, a Dutchman, as the
first constructor of a telescope, and says, that ‘as he was amusing
himself with making mirrors and burning-glasses, he casually thought
of looking through two of his lenses at a time, and found that distant
objects appeared very large and distinct.’ Others say that this great
discovery was first made by John Lippersheim, a maker of spectacles at
Middleburg, or rather by his children, who were diverting themselves
with looking through two glasses at a time, and placing them at
different distances from each other. But Borellus, who wrote a book ‘on
the invention of the telescope,’ gives this honour to Zacharias Jansen,
another spectacle-maker in the same town, who, he says, made the
first telescope in 1590. Jansen was a diligent inquirer into nature,
and, being engaged in such pursuits, he was trying what use could be
made of lenses for those purposes, when he fortunately hit upon the
construction. Having found the arrangement of glasses which produced
the effect desired, he enclosed them in a tube, and ran with his
instrument to prince Maurice, who, immediately conceiving that it might
be of use to him in his wars, desired the author to keep it a secret.
Such are the rude conceptions and selfish views of princely _warriors_,
who would apply every invention in their power for the destruction
of mankind. But the telescope was soon destined to more noble and
honourable achievements. Jansen, it is said, directed his instrument
towards celestial objects, and distinctly saw the spots on the surface
of the moon, and discovered many new stars, particularly seven pretty
considerable ones in the Great Bear. His son Joannes is said to have
noted the lucid circle near the lower limb of the moon, now named
_Tycho_, from whence several bright rays seem to dart in different
directions. In viewing Jupiter, he perceived two, sometimes three, and
at the most four small stars, a little above or below him, and thought
that they performed revolutions around him. This was, probably, the
first observation of the satellites of Jupiter, though the person who
made it was not aware of the importance of his discovery.[17]

It is not improbable that different persons about Middleburgh hit upon
the invention, in different modes, about the same time. Lippersheim
seems to have made his first rude telescope by adjusting two glasses
on a board, and supporting them on brass circles.[18] Other workmen,
particularly Metius and Jansen, in emulation of each other, seem to
have made use of that discovery, and by the new form they gave it, made
all the honour of it their own. One of them, considering the effects
of light as injurious to distinctness, placed the glasses in a tube
blackened within. The other, still more cautious, placed the same
glasses within tubes capable of sliding one in another, both to vary
the prospects, by lengthening the instrument, according to the pleasure
of the observer, and to render it portable and commodious. Thus, it
is probable that different persons had a share in the invention, and
jointly contributed to its improvement. At any rate, it is undoubtedly
to the Dutch that we owe the original invention. The first telescope
made by Jansen, did not exceed fifteen or sixteen inches in length, and
therefore its magnifying power could not have been very great.

The famous Galileo has frequently been supposed to have been the
inventor of the telescope, but he acknowledges that he had not the
honour of being the original inventor, having first learned from
a German, that such an instrument had already been made; although,
from his own account, it appears that he had actually re-invented
this instrument. The following is the account, in his own words, of
the circumstances which led him to construct a telescope. ‘Nearly
ten months ago (namely in April or May 1609) it was reported that a
certain Dutchman had made a perspective through which many distant
objects appeared distinct as if they were near: several effects of
this wonderful instrument were reported, which some believed and
others denied: but, having it confirmed to me a few days after by
a letter from the noble John Badoverie, at Paris, I applied myself
to consider the reason of it, and by what means I might contrive a
similar instrument, which I afterwards attained to by the doctrine of
refractions. And, first, I prepared a leaden tube, to whose extremities
I fitted two spectacle-glasses, both of them plain on one side, and
on the other side, one of them was spherically convex, and the other
concave. Then applying my eye to the concave, I saw objects appear
pretty large and pretty near me. They appeared three times nearer and
nine times larger in surface than to the naked eye: and soon after I
made another, which represented objects about sixty times larger, and
eight times nearer; and, at last, having spared no labour nor expense,
I made an instrument so excellent, as to show things almost a thousand
times larger, and above thirty times nearer, than to the naked eye.’
In another part of his writings, Galileo informs us that ‘he was at
Venice when he heard of Prince Maurice’s instrument, but nothing of
its construction; that the first night, after he returned to Padua,
he solved the problem, and made his instrument the next day; and soon
after, presented it to the Doge at Venice, who, to do him honour for
his grand invention, gave him the ducal letters which settled him for
life in his lectureship at Padua; and the Republic, on the twenty-fifth
of August in the same year (1610) more than tripled his salary as
professor.’

The following is the account which this philosopher gives of the
process of reasoning, which led him to the construction of a
telescope:--‘I argued in the following manner. The contrivance consists
either of one glass or more--one is not sufficient, since it must
be either convex, concave, or plane; the last does not produce any
sensible alteration in objects, the concave diminishes them; it is true
that the convex magnifies, but it renders them confused and indistinct;
consequently one glass is insufficient to produce the desired effect.
Proceeding to consider two glasses, and bearing in mind that the plane
glass causes no change, I determined that the instrument could not
consist of the combination of a plane glass with either of the other
two. I therefore applied myself to make experiments on combinations of
the two other kinds; and thus obtained that of which I was in search.’
If the true inventor is the person who makes the discovery by reasoning
and reflection, by tracing facts and principles to their consequences,
and by applying his invention to important purposes, then, Galileo may
be considered as the real inventor of the telescope. No sooner had he
constructed this instrument--before he had seen any similar one--than
he directed his tube to the celestial regions, and his unwearied
diligence and ardour were soon rewarded by a series of new and splendid
discoveries. He descried the four satellites of Jupiter, and marked the
periods of their revolutions; he discovered the phases of Venus, and
thus was enabled to adduce a new proof of the Copernican system, and
to remove an objection that had been brought against it. He traced on
the lunar orb, a resemblance to the structure of the earth, and plainly
perceived the outlines of mountains and vales, casting their shadows
over different parts of its surface. He observed, that when Mars was
in quadrature, his figure varied slightly from a perfect circle;
and that Saturn consisted of a triple body, having a small globe on
each side--which deception was owing to the imperfect power of his
telescope, which was insufficient to show him that the phenomenon was
in reality a ring. In viewing the sun, he discovered large dark spots
on the surface of that luminary, by which he ascertained that that
mighty orb performed a revolution round its axis. He brought to view
multitudes of stars imperceptible to the naked eye, and ascertained
that those nebulous appearances in the heavens which constitute the
Milky Way, consist of a vast collection of minute stars, too closely
compacted together to produce an impression on our unassisted vision.

The results of Galileo’s observations were given to the world in
a small work, entitled ‘_Nuncius Sidereus_,’ or, ‘News from the
starry regions,’ which produced an extraordinary sensation among
the learned. These discoveries soon spread throughout Europe, and
were incessantly talked of, and were the cause of much speculation
and debate among the circles of philosophers. Many doubted; many
positively refused to believe so novel and unlooked-for announcements,
because they ran counter to the philosophy of Aristotle, and all the
preconceived notions which then prevailed in the learned world. It
is curious, and may be instructive, to consider to what a length of
absurdity, ignorance and prejudice carried many of those who made
pretensions to learning and science. Some tried to reason against
the facts alleged to be discovered, others contented themselves, and
endeavoured to satisfy others, with the simple _assertion_ that such
things were not, and could not possibly be; and the manner in which
they supported themselves in their incredulity was truly ridiculous.
‘O my dear Kepler,’ says Galileo in a letter to that astronomer,
‘how I wish we could have one hearty laugh together. Here at Padua
is the principal professor of philosophy, whom I have repeatedly and
urgently requested to look at the moon and planets through my glass,
which _he pertinaciously refuses to do_, lest his opinions should be
overturned. Why are you not here? what shouts of laughter we should
have at this glorious folly! and to hear the professor of philosophy at
Pisa labouring with the Grand Duke with logical arguments, as if with
magical incantations, to charm the new planets out of the sky.’ Another
opponent of Galileo, one Christmann, says in a book he published, ‘We
are not to think that Jupiter has four satellites given him by nature,
in order, by revolving round him, to immortalize the Medici who first
had notice of the observation. These are the _dreams of idle men_,
who love ludicrous ideas better than our laborious and industrious
correction of the heavens. Nature abhors so horrible a chaos; and
to the truly wise, such vanity is detestable.’ One Martin Horky, a
would-be philosopher, declared to Kepler, ‘I will never concede his
four new planets to that Italian from Padua, _though I should die for
it_;’ and he followed up this declaration, by publishing a book against
Galileo, in which he examines four principal questions respecting the
alleged planets; 1. Whether they exist? 2. What they are? 3. What they
are like? 4. Why they are? The first question is soon disposed of by
declaring positively that he has examined the heavens with Galileo’s
own glass, and that no such thing as a satellite about Jupiter exists.
To the second, he declares solemnly that he does not more surely
know, that he has a soul in his body than that reflected rays are
the sole cause of Galileo’s erroneous observations. In regard to the
third question, he says, that these planets are like the smallest fly
compared to an elephant; and finally, concludes on the fourth, that
the only use of them is to gratify Galileo’s ‘thirst of gold,’ and to
afford himself a subject of discussion. Kepler, in a letter to Galileo,
when alluding to Horky, says, ‘He begged so hard to be forgiven, that I
have taken him again into favour upon this preliminary condition--that
I am to show him Jupiter’s satellites, AND HE IS TO SEE THEM,
and own that they are there.’

The following is a specimen of the reasoning of certain pretended
philosophers of that age against the discoveries of Galileo. Sizzi, a
Florentine astronomer, reasons in this strain: ‘There are seven windows
given to animals in the domicile of the head, through which the air
is admitted to the rest of the tabernacle of the body to enlighten,
to warm and to nourish it; two nostrils, two eyes, two ears, and a
mouth; so in the heavens, or the great world, there are two favourable
stars, two unpropitious, two luminaries, and Mercury alone undecided
and indifferent. From which and many other similar phenomena in nature,
such as the seven metals, &c., we gather that the number of planets
is _necessarily seven_. Moreover, the satellites are invisible to
the naked eye, and therefore can exert no influence on the earth, and
therefore would be useless, _and therefore do not exist_. Besides, as
well the Jews as other ancient nations have adopted the division of
the week into seven days, and have named them from the seven planets.
Now, if we increase the number of the planets, this whole system
falls to the ground.’ The opinions which then prevailed in regard to
Galileo’s observations on the moon, were such as the following:--Some
thought that the dark shades on the moon’s surface arose from the
interposition of opaque bodies floating between her and the sun, which
prevent his light from reaching those parts; others imagined that, on
account of her vicinity to the earth, she was partly tainted with the
imperfections of our terrestrial and elementary nature, and was not
of that entirely pure and refined substance of which the more remote
heavens consist: and a third party looked on her as a vast mirror, and
maintained that the dark parts of her surface were the reflected images
of our earthly forests and mountains.

Such learned nonsense is a disgrace to our species, and to the
rational faculties with which man is endowed, and exhibits, in a most
ludicrous manner, the imbecility and prejudice of those who made bold
pretensions to erudition and philosophy. The statement of such facts,
however, may be instructive, if they tend to guard us against those
prejudices and pre-conceived opinions, which prevent the mind from the
cordial reception of truth, and from the admission of improvements in
society which run counter to long-established customs. For the same
principles and prejudices, though in a different form, still operate
in society and retard the improvement of the social state, the march
of science, and the progress of Christianity. How ridiculous is it for
a man, calling himself a philosopher, to be afraid to look through a
glass to an existing object in the heavens, lest it should endanger
his previous opinions! And how foolish is it to resist any improvement
or reformation in society, because it does not exactly accord with
existing opinions, and with ‘the wisdom of our ancestors.’

It is not a little surprising, that Galileo should have first hit on
that construction of a telescope which goes by his name, and which
was formed with a _concave_ glass next the eye. This construction of
a telescope is more difficult to be understood, in theory, than one
which is composed solely of convex glasses; and its field of view is
comparatively very small, so that it is almost useless when attempted
to be made of a great length. In the present day, we cannot help
wondering that Galileo and other astronomers, should have made such
discoveries as they did with such an instrument, the use of which must
have required a great degree of patience and address. Galileo’s best
telescope, which he constructed ‘with great trouble and expense,’
magnified the diameters of objects only thirty-three times; but its
length is not stated--which would depend upon the focal distance of the
concave eye-glass. If the eye-glass was two inches focus, the length
of the instrument would be five feet four inches; if it was only one
inch, the length would be two feet eight inches, which is the least we
can allow to it--the object-glass being thirty-three inches focus, and
the eye-glass placed an inch within this focus. With this telescope,
Galileo discovered the satellites of Jupiter, the crescent of Venus,
and the other celestial objects to which we have already alluded.
The telescopes made in Holland, are supposed to have been constructed
solely of _convex_ glasses, on the principle of the astronomical
telescope; and, if so, Galileo’s telescope was in reality a new
invention.

Certain other claimants of the invention of the telescope, have
appeared, besides those already mentioned. Francis Fontana, in his
‘celestial observations,’ says, that he was assured by a Mr. Hardy,
advocate of the parliament of Paris, a person of great learning and
undoubted integrity, that on the death of his father, there was found
among his things an old tube, by which distant objects were distinctly
seen, and that it was of a date long prior to the telescope lately
invented, and had been kept by him as a secret. Mr. Leonard Digges,
a gentleman who lived near Bristol, in the seventeenth century, and
was possessed of great and various knowledge, positively asserts in
his ‘_Stratoticos_,’ and in another work, that his father, a military
gentleman, had an instrument which he used in the field, by which he
could bring distant objects near, and could know a man at the distance
of three miles. Mr. Thomas Digges, in the preface to his ‘Pantometria,’
published in 1591, declares, “My father, by his continual painful
practices, assisted by demonstrations mathematical, was able, and
sundry times hath by proportional glasses, duly situate in convenient
angles, not only discovered things far off, read letters, numbered
pieces of money, with the very coin and superscription thereof, cast by
some of his friends of purpose, upon downs in open fields, but also,
seven miles off, declared what hath been done that instant, in private
places. He hath also, sundry times, by the sun-beams, fired powder
and discharged ordnance half a mile and more distant, and many other
matters far more strange and rare, of which there are yet living divers
witnesses.”

It is by no means unlikely, that persons accustomed to reflection,
and imbued with a certain degree of curiosity, when handling
spectacle-glasses, and amusing themselves with their magnifying powers
and other properties, might sometimes hit upon the construction
of a telescope; as it only requires two lenses of different focal
distances to be held at a certain distance from each other, in order
to show distant objects magnified. Nay, even one lens, of a long
focal distance, is sufficient to constitute a telescope of a moderate
magnifying power, as I shall show in the sequel. But such instruments,
when they happened to be constructed accidentally, appear to have been
kept as secrets, and confined to the cabinets of the curious, so that
they never came into general use; and as their magnifying power would
probably be comparatively small, the appearance of the heavenly bodies
would not be much enlarged by such instruments--nor is it likely that
they would be often directed to the heavens. On the whole, therefore,
we may conclude that the period when instruments of this description
came into general use, and were applied to useful purposes, was when
Galileo constructed his first telescopes.




CHAPTER II.


OF THE CAMERA OBSCURA.

Before proceeding to a particular description of the different kinds
of telescopes, I shall first give a brief description of the Camera
Obscura, as the phenomena exhibited by this instrument tend to
illustrate the principle of a refracting telescope.

The term _Camera Obscura_ literally signifies a darkened vault or roof;
and hence it came to denote a chamber, or box, or any other place
made dark for the purpose of optical experiments. The camera obscura,
though a simple, is yet a very curious and noble contrivance; as it
naturally and clearly explains the manner in which vision is performed,
and the principle of the telescope, and entertains the spectator with
a most exquisite picture of surrounding objects, painted in the most
accurate proportions and colours by the hand of nature. The manner of
exhibiting the pictures of objects in a dark room is as follows:--In
one of the window-shutters of a room which commands a good prospect
of objects not very distant, a circular hole should be cut of four or
five inches diameter. In this hole an instrument should be placed,
called a _Scioptric ball_, which has three parts, a frame, a ball, and
a lens. The ball has a circular hole cut through the middle, in which
the lens is fixed, and its use is, to turn every way so as to take in
a view of objects on every side. The chamber should be made perfectly
dark; and a white screen, or a large sheet of elephant paper, should be
placed opposite to the lens, and in its focus, to receive the image.
If then, the objects without be strongly enlightened by the sun, there
will be a beautiful living picture of the scene delineated on the white
screen, where every object is beheld in its proportions, and with its
colours even more vivid than life; green objects appear in the picture
more intensely green, and yellow, blue, red or white flowers appear
much more beautiful in the picture than in nature; if the lens be a
good one, and the room perfectly dark, the perspective is seen in
perfection. The lights and shadows are not only perfectly just, but
also greatly heightened; and, what is peculiar to this delineation,
and which no other picture or painting can exhibit--the _motions_ of
all the objects are exactly expressed in the picture; the boughs of
the trees wave, the leaves quiver, the smoke ascends in a waving form,
the people walk, the children at their sports leap and run, the horse
and cart move along, the ships sail, the clouds soar and shift their
aspects, and all as natural as in the real objects; the motions being
somewhat quicker, as they are performed in a more contracted scene.

These are the _inimitable_ perfections of a picture, drawn by the rays
of light as the only pencil in nature’s hand, and which are finished
in a moment; for no sensible interval elapses before the painting is
completed, when the ground on which it is painted is prepared and
adjusted. In comparison of such a picture, the finest productions of
the most celebrated artists, the proportions of Raphael, the natural
tints and colouring of Titian, and the shadowing of the Venetians,
are but coarse and sorry daubings, when set in competition with what
nature can exhibit by the rays of light passing through a single lens.
The Camera obscura is at the same time the painter’s assistant, and
the painter’s reproach. From the picture it forms he receives his best
instructions, and is shown what he should endeavour to attain; and
hence, too, he learns the imperfections of his art, and what it is
impossible for him to imitate. As a proof of this, the picture formed
in the dark chamber will bear to be magnified to a great extent,
without defacing its beauty, or injuring the fineness of its parts; but
the finest painted landscape, if viewed through a high magnifier will
appear only as a coarse daubing.

The following scheme will illustrate what has been now stated
respecting the dark chamber. EF represents a darkened room, in the side
of which, IK, is made the circular hole V, in which, on the inside,
is fixed the scioptric ball. At some considerable distance from this
hole is exhibited a landscape of houses, trees, and other objects,
ABCD, which are opposite to the window. The rays which flow from the
different objects which compose this landscape, to the lens at V, and
which pass through it, are converged to their respective foci, on the
opposite wall of the chamber HG or on a white moveable screen placed
in the focus of the lens, where they all combine to paint a lively and
beautiful picture of the range of objects directly opposite, and on
each side, so far as the lens can take in.

Though I have said, that a scioptric ball and socket are expedient to
be used in the above experiment, yet where such an instrument is not
at hand, the lens may be placed in a short tube made of pasteboard or
any other material, and fixed in the hole made in the window shutter.
The only imperfection attending this method is, that the lens can
exhibit those objects only which lie directly opposite the window.

[Illustration: _figure 37._]

Some may be disposed to consider it as an imperfection in this picture,
that all the objects appear in an _inverted_ position; as they must
necessarily do, according to what we formerly stated respecting the
properties of convex lenses, (p. 72). There are, however, different
modes of viewing the picture as if it were erect. For, if we stand
before the picture, and hold a common mirror against our breast at
an acute angle with the picture, and look down upon it, we shall see
all the images of the objects as if restored to their erect position;
and by the reflection of the mirror, the picture will receive such a
lustre as will make it still more delightful. Or, if a large concave
mirror were placed before the picture at such a distance, that its
image may appear before the mirror, it will then appear erect and
pendulous in the air in the front of the mirror. Or, if the image be
received on a frame of paper, we may stand behind the frame, with our
face towards the window, and look down upon the objects, when they will
appear as if erect.

The experiment of the Camera Obscura may serve to explain and
illustrate the nature of a common refracting telescope. Let us suppose,
that the lens in the window-shutter represents the object-glass of a
refracting telescope. This glass forms an image in its focus, which
is in every respect an exact picture or representation of the objects
before it; and consequently the same idea is formed in the mind, of the
nature, form, magnitude, and colour of the object--whether the eye at
the centre of the glass views the object itself, or the image formed in
its focus. For, as formerly stated, the object and its image are both
seen under the same angles by the eye placed at the centre of the lens.
Without such an image as is formed in the camera obscura--depicted
either in the tube of a telescope or in the eye itself--no telescope
could possibly be formed. If we now suppose that, behind the image
formed in the dark chamber, we apply a convex lens of a short focal
distance to view that image, then the image will be seen distinctly,
in the same manner as we view common objects, such as a leaf or a
flower, with a magnifying glass; consequently, the object itself will
be seen distinct and magnified. And, as the same image is nearer to one
lens than the other, it will subtend a larger angle at the nearest
lens, and of course, will appear larger than through the other, and
consequently the object will be seen magnified in proportion. For
example, let us suppose the lens in the camera obscura, or the object
lens of a telescope, to be five feet, or sixty inches focal distance,
at this distance from the glass, an image of the distant objects
opposite to it will be formed. If now, we place a small lens two inches
focal distance beyond this point, or five feet two inches from the
object-glass, the objects, when viewed through the small lens, will
appear considerably magnified, and apparently much nearer than to the
naked eye. The degree of magnifying power is in proportion to the
focal distances of the two glasses; that is, in the present case, in
the proportion of two inches, the focus of the small lens, to sixty
inches, the focus of the object lens. Divide sixty by two, the quotient
is thirty, which gives the magnifying power of such a telescope, that
is, it represents objects thirty times nearer, or under an angle thirty
times larger than to the naked eye. If the eye-glass, instead of being
two inches, were only one and a half inch focus, the magnifying power
would be in the proportion of one and a half to sixty, or forty times.
If the eye-glass were three inches focus, the magnifying power would
be twenty times; and so on, with regard to other proportions. In all
cases, where a telescope is composed of only two convex lenses, the
magnifying power is determined, _by dividing the focal distance of the
object-glass, by the focal distance of the eye-glass_, and the quotient
expresses the number of times the object is magnified, in length
and breadth. This and various other particulars, will be more fully
illustrated in the sequel.

In performing experiments with the camera obscura in a darkened
chamber, it is requisite that the following particulars be attended
to:--1. That the lens be well figured, and free from any veins or
blemishes that might distort the picture. 2. That it be placed
_directly against_ the object whose image we wish to see distinctly
delineated. 3. The lens should be of a proper size both as to its
breadth and focal distance. It should not be less than three or four
feet focal distance, otherwise the picture will be too small, and the
parts of objects too minute to be distinctly perceived; nor should
it exceed fifteen or eighteen feet, as in this case the picture will
be faint, and of course not so pleasing. The best medium as to focal
distance, is from five to eight or ten feet. The aperture, too, or
breadth of the glass, should not be too small, otherwise the image
will be obscure, and the minute parts of it invisible for want of a
sufficient quantity of light. A lens of six feet focal distance, for
example, will require an aperture of at least two inches. Lenses of a
shorter focal distance require less apertures, and those of a longer
focal distance larger. But if the aperture be too large, the image
will be confused, and indistinct, by the admission of too much light.
4. We should never attempt to exhibit the images of objects, unless
when the sun is shining and strongly illuminating the objects, except
in the case of very near objects placed in a good light. As one of the
greatest beauties, in the phenomena of the dark chamber, consists in
the exquisite appearance and contrast of light and shadows, nothing of
this kind can be perceived but from objects directly illuminated by the
sun. 5. A south window should never be used in the forenoon, as the sun
cannot then enlighten the north side of an object; and besides, his
rays would be apt to shine upon the lens, which would make the picture
appear with a confused lustre. An east window is best in the afternoon,
and a western in the morning; but a north window is in most cases to
be preferred, especially in the forenoon, when the sun is shining with
his greatest strength and splendour. In general, that window ought to
be used which looks to the quarter opposite to that in which the sun is
shining.

The picture should be received upon a very white surface, as the finest
and whitest paper, or a painted cloth, bordered with black; as white
bodies reflect most copiously the incident rays, while black surfaces
absorb them. If the screen could be bent into the concave segment of
a sphere, of which the focal distance of the double convex lens which
is used, is the radius, the parts of the picture adjacent to the
extremities would appear most distinct. Sir D. Brewster informs us
that, having tried a number of white substances of different degrees
of smoothness, and several metallic surfaces, on which to receive the
image, he happened to receive the picture on the silvered back of a
looking-glass, and was surprised at the brilliancy and distinctness
with which external objects were represented. To remove the spherical
protuberances of the tin foil, he ground the surface very carefully
with a bed of hones which he had used for working the plane specula of
Newtonian telescopes. By this operation, which may be performed without
injuring the other side of the mirror, he obtained a surface finely
adapted for the reception of images. The minute parts of the landscape
were formed with so much precision, and the brilliancy of colouring
was so uncommonly fine, as to equal, if not exceed the images that are
formed in the air by means of concave specula.

The following additional circumstances may be stated respecting the
phenomena exhibited in the dark chamber. A more critical idea may
be formed of any _movement_ in the picture here presented than from
observing the motion of the object itself. For instance, a man walking
in a picture appears to have an undulating motion, or to rise up and
down every step he takes, and the hands seem to move almost exactly
like a pendulum; whereas scarcely any thing of this kind is observed
in the man himself, as viewed by the naked eye. Again, if an object be
placed just twice the focal distance from the lens without the room,
the image will be formed at the same distance from the lens within the
room, and consequently will be equal in magnitude to the object itself.
The recognition of this principle may be of use to those concerned in
drawing, and who may wish, at any time, to form a picture of the exact
size of the object. If the object be placed further from the lens than
twice its focal length, the image will be less than the object. If it
be placed nearer, the image will be greater than the life. In regard to
immoveable objects, such as houses, gardens, trees, &c., we may form
the images of so many different sizes, by means of different lenses,
the shorter focus making the lesser picture, and the longer focal
distance the largest.

The experiments with the camera obscura, may likewise serve to
illustrate the nature of vision, and the functions of the human eye.
The frame or socket of the scioptric ball may represent the _orbit_
of the natural eye. The ball, which turns every way, resembles the
_globe_ of the eye, moveable in its orbit. The hole in the ball may
represent the _pupil_ of the eye; the convex lens corresponds to the
_crystalline humour_, which is shaped like a lens, and contributes
to form the images of objects on the inner part of the eye. The dark
chamber itself, is somewhat similar to the _internal part of the eye_,
which is lined all around, and under the retina, with a membrane,
over which is spread a mucous of a very black colour. The white wall
or frame of white paper to receive the picture of objects, is a fair
representation of the _retina_ of the eye, on which all the images of
external objects are depicted. Such are some of the general points of
resemblance between the apparatus connected with the dark chamber, and
the organ of vision; but the human eye is an organ of such exquisite
construction, and composed of such a number and variety of delicate
parts, that it cannot be adequately represented by any artificial
contrivance.

The darkened chamber is frequently exhibited in a manner somewhat
different from what we have above described, as in the following
scheme, (fig. 38) which is termed the _revolving camera obscura_. In
this construction, KH represents a plane mirror or metallic reflector,
placed at half a right angle to the convex lens HI, by which, rays
proceeding from objects situated in the direction O are reflected to
the lens, which forms an image of the objects on a round white table
at T, around which several spectators may stand, and view the picture,
as delineated on a horizontal plane. The reflector, along with its
case, is capable of being turned round, by means of a simple apparatus
connected with it, so as to take in, in succession, all the objects
which compose the surrounding scene. But as the image here is received
on a flat surface, the rays _fm_, _en_, will have to diverge farther
than the central rays _dc_; and hence the representation of the
object, near the sides, will be somewhat distorted; to remedy which,
the image should be received on a concave surface, as _ab_ or PS. This
is the general plan of those Camera Obscuras, fitted up in large wooden
tents, which are frequently exhibited in our large cities, and removed
occasionally from one town to another. Were an instrument of this
kind fitted up on a _small scale_, a hole might be made in one of the
sides, as at E, where the eye could be applied to view the picture. The
focal distances of the lenses used in large instruments of this kind,
are generally from eight to twelve feet, in which case they produce
a telescopic effect upon distant objects, so as to make them appear
nearer than when viewed with the naked eye.

[Illustration: _figure 38._]

[Illustration: _figure 39._]

The camera obscura is frequently constructed in a _portable form_,
so as to be carried about for the purpose of delineating landscapes.
The following is a brief description of the instrument in this form.
AC is a convex lens placed near the end of a tube or drawer, which is
moveable in the side of a square box, within which is a plane mirror
DE, reclining backward in an angle of forty-five degrees from the
perpendicular _pn_. The pencils of rays flowing from the object OB,
and passing through the convex lens--instead of proceeding forward and
forming the image HI, are reflected upward by the mirror, and meet in
points as FG, at the same distance at which they would have met at H
and I, if they had not been intercepted by the mirror. At FG, the image
of the object OB is received either on a piece of oiled paper, or more
frequently on a plane _unpolished_ glass, placed in the horizontal
situation FG, which receives the images of all objects, opposite to the
lens, and on which, or on an oiled paper placed upon it, their outlines
may be traced by a pencil. The moveable tube on which the lens is
fixed, serves to adjust the focus for near and distant objects, till
their images appear distinctly painted on the horizontal glass at FG.
Above is shown the most common form of the box of this kind of Camera
Obscura. A is the position of the lens, BC, the position of the mirror,
D, the plane unpolished glass on which the images are depicted, GH a
moveable top or screen to prevent the light from injuring the picture,
and EF, the moveable tube.

[Illustration: _figure 40._]

_The Daguerreotype._--An important, and somewhat surprising discovery
has lately been made, in relation to the picture formed by the Camera
Obscura. It is found, that the images formed by this instrument are
capable of being indelibly fixed on certain surfaces previously
prepared for the purpose, so that the picture is rendered permanent.
When a Camera is presented to any object or landscape strongly
illuminated by the sun, and the prepared ground for receiving the
image is adjusted, and a certain time allowed to elapse till the
rays of light produce their due effect, in a few minutes or even
seconds, a picture of the objects opposite to the lens is indelibly
impressed upon the prepared plate, in all the accurate proportions
and perspective, which distinguish the images formed in a dark
chamber--which representations may be hung up in apartments, along
with other paintings and engravings; and will likely retain their
beauty and lustre for many years. These are pictures of nature’s own
workmanship finished in an extremely short space of time, and with the
most exquisite delicacy and accuracy. The effect is evidently owing to
certain chemical properties in the rays of light; and opens a new field
for experiment and investigation to the philosopher. The only defect
in the picture is, that it is not coloured; but, in the progress of
experiments on this subject, it is not unlikely that even this object
may be accomplished, in which case, we should be able to obtain the
most accurate landscapes and representations of all objects, which
can possibly be formed. This art or discovery goes by the name of the
_Daguerreotype_ from M. Daguerre, a Frenchman, who is supposed to have
been the first discoverer, and who received a large premium from the
French government for disclosing the process, and making the discovery
public. Several improvements and modifications, in reference to the
preparation of the plates, have been made since the discovery was first
announced, about the beginning of 1839; and the pictures formed on this
principle, are frequently distinguished by the name of _Photogenic_
drawings; and are now exhibited at most of our public scientific
institutions.

This new science or art, has been distinguished by different names.
It was first called _Photography_, from two Greek words, signifying
_writing by light_: it was afterwards called the art of _Photogenic
Drawing_, or drawing produced by light. M. Daguerre gave it the name
of _Heliography_, or _writing by the sun_, all which appellatives
are derived from the Greek, and are expressive, in some degree, of
the nature of the process. We shall, however, make use of the term
Daguerreotype, derived from the name of the inventor.

As it does not fall within our plan to give any minute descriptions of
the Daguerreotype process, we shall just give a few general hints in
reference to it, referring those who wish for particular details, to
the separate treatises which have been published respecting it. The
first thing necessary to be attended to in this art is, the preparation
of the plate on which the drawing is to be made. The plate consists
of a thin leaf of copper, plated with silver; both metals together,
not being thicker than a card. The object of the copper is simply to
support the silver, which must be the purest that can be procured. But
though the copper should be no thicker than to serve the purpose of
support, it is necessary that it should be so thick as to prevent the
plate from being warped, which would produce a distortion of the images
traced upon it. This plate must be polished;--and for this purpose, the
following articles are required--a phial of olive oil--some very fine
cotton--pumice-powder, ground till it is almost impalpable, and tied up
in a piece of fine muslin, thin enough to let the powder pass through
without touching the plate when the bag is shaken. A little nitric acid
diluted with sixteen times, by measure, its own quantity of water--a
frame of wire on which to place the plate, when being heated--a spirit
lamp to make the plate hot--a small box with inclined sides within, and
having a lid to shut it up close--and a square board large enough to
hold the drawing, and having catches at the side to keep it steady.

To the above prerequisites, a good _Camera Obscura_ is, of course,
essentially necessary. This instrument should be large enough to admit
the plate of the largest drawing intended to be taken. The lens which
forms the image of the object, should, if possible, be _achromatic_,
and of a considerable diameter. In an excellent instrument of this
description, now before me, the lens is an achromatic, about 3 inches
diameter, but capable of being contracted to a smaller aperture. Its
focal distance is about 17 inches; and the box, exclusive of the tube
which contains the lens, is 15 inches long, 13-1/2 inches broad, and
11 inches deep. It forms a beautiful and well-defined picture of every
well-enlightened object to which it is directed.

Before the plate is placed in the camera, there are certain operations
to be performed. 1. The surface of the plate should be made perfectly
smooth, or highly polished. For this purpose, it must be laid flat,
with the silver side upwards, upon several folds of paper for a
bedding; and having been well polished in the usual way, the surface
must be powdered equally and carefully with fine pumice enclosed in
the muslin bag. Then taking a little cotton wool, dipped in olive
oil, it must be rubbed over the plate with rounding strokes, and then
crossing them by others which commence at right angles with the first.
This process must be repeated frequently, changing the cotton, and
renewing the pumice powder every time. A small portion of cotton must
now be moistened with the diluted nitric acid, and applied equally
to the whole surface. The next thing to be done is to make the plate
thoroughly and equally hot, by holding the plate with a pair of
pincers, by the corner, over a charcoal fire, and when the plate is
sufficiently hot, a white coating will be observed on the silver, which
indicates that that part of the operation is finished. An even cold
surface is next wanted, such as a metallic plate cooled almost to the
freezing point by muriate of soda, and to this the heated plate must be
suddenly transferred.

2. The next operation is to give the plate a coating of _Iodine_. This
is accomplished by fixing the plate upon a board, and then putting it
into a box containing a little dish with iodine divided into small
pieces, with its face downward, and supported with small brackets at
the corners. In this position, the plate must remain till it assume
_a full gold colour_, through the condensation of the iodine on its
surface--which process should be conducted in a darkened apartment.
The requisite time for the condensation of the iodine varies from
five minutes to half an hour. When this process is satisfactorily
accomplished, the plate should be immediately fixed in a frame with
catches and bands, and placed in the Camera; and the transference from
one receptacle to another should be made as quickly as possible, and
with only so much light as will enable the operator to see what he is
doing.

3. The next operation is to obtain the drawing. Having placed the
Camera in front of the scene to be represented, and the lens being
adjusted to the proper focus, the ground-glass of the Camera is
withdrawn, and the prepared plate is substituted for it; and the
whole is left till the natural images are drawn by the natural light
from the object. The time necessary to leave the plate for a complete
delineation of the objects, depends upon the intensity of the light.
Objects in the shade will require more time for their delineation
than those in the broad light. The full clear light of the south of
Europe, Spain, Italy, and particularly, the more glowing brilliancy
of tropical countries, will effect the object much more speedily than
the duller luminosity of a northern clime. Some hours of the day are
likewise more favourable than others. Daguerre states, that ‘the most
favourable, is from 7 A.M. to 3 o’clock P.M., and
that a drawing could be effected in Paris in 3 or 4 minutes, in June
and July, which would require 5 or 6, in May and August, and 7 or 8 in
April and September.’ In the progress of this art, at the present time,
portraits and other objects are frequently delineated in the course of
a few seconds.

4. Immediately after removing the plate from the Camera, it is next
placed over the vapour of mercury, which is placed in a cup at the
bottom of a box, and a spirit lamp applied to its bottom, till the
temperature rise to 140 of Fahrenheit. This process is intended to
bring out the image, which is not visible when withdrawn from the
Camera; but in the course of a few minutes a faint tracery will
begin to appear, and in a very short time the figure will be clearly
developed.

5. The next operation is _to fix the impression_. In order to this, the
coating on which the design was impressed must be removed, to preserve
it from being decomposed by the rays of light. For this purpose, the
plate is placed in a trough containing common water, plunging, and
withdrawing it immediately, and then plunging it into a solution of
salt and water, till the yellow coating has disappeared.

Such is a very brief sketch of the _photogenic_ processes of Daguerre.
Other substances, however, more easily prepared, have been recommended
by Mr. Talbot, F.R.S., who appears, about the same time, to have
invented a process somewhat similar to that of Daguerre. The following
are his directions for the preparation of _Photogenic Paper_.

The paper is to be dipped into a solution of salt in water, in the
proportion of half an ounce of salt to half a pint of water. Let
the superfluous moisture drain off, and then, laying the paper upon
a clean cloth, _dab_ it gently with a napkin, so as to prevent the
salt collecting in one spot more than another. The paper is then to
be pinned down by two of its corners on a drawing board, by means
of common pins, and one side washed or wetted with the Photogenic
fluid, using the brush prepared for that purpose, and taking care to
distribute it equally. Next dry the paper as rapidly as you can at
the fire, and it will be fit for use for most purposes. If, when the
paper is exposed to the sun’s rays, it should assume an irregular tint,
a very thin extra wash of the fluid will render the colour uniform,
and at the same time somewhat darker. Should it be required to make a
more sensitive description of paper, after the first application of
the fluid, the solution of salt should be applied, and the paper dried
at the fire. Apply a second wash of the fluid, and dry it at the fire
again: employ the salt a third time, dry it,--and one application more
of the fluid will, when dried, have made the paper extremely sensitive.
When slips of such papers, differently prepared, are exposed to the
action of day light, those which are soonest affected by the light, by
becoming dark, are the best prepared.

When photogenic drawings are finished in a perfect way, the designs
then taken on the plate or paper are exceedingly beautiful and
correct, and will bear to be inspected with a considerable magnifying
power, so that the most minute portions of the objects delineated may
be distinctly perceived. We have seen portraits, finished in this way
by a London artist, with an accuracy which the best miniature painter
could never attempt--every feature being so distinct, as to bear being
viewed with a deep magnifier. And in landscapes and buildings, such
is the delicacy and accuracy of such representations, that the marks
of the chisel and the crevices in the stones may frequently be seen
by applying a magnifying lens to the picture; so that we may justly
exclaim, in the words of the Poet: ‘Who can paint like nature!.’ That
LIGHT--which is the first-born of Deity, which pervades all
space, and illuminates all worlds--in the twinkling of an eye, and with
an accuracy which no art can imitate, depicts every object in its exact
form and proportions, superior to every thing that human genius can
produce.

The Photogenic art, in its progress, will doubtless be productive of
many highly interesting and beneficial effects. It affords us the power
of representing, by an accurate and rapid process, all the grand and
beautiful objects connected with our globe--the landscapes peculiar
to every country--the lofty ranges of mountains which distinguish
Alpine regions--the noble edifices which art has reared--the monumental
remains of antiquity--and every other object which it would be
interesting for human beings to contemplate; so that in the course
of time, the general scenery of our world, in its prominent parts,
might be exhibited to almost every eye. The commission of the French
Chambers, when referring to this art, has the following remark, ‘To
copy the millions upon millions of hieroglyphics which cover even
the exterior of the great monuments of Thebes and Memphis, of Carnac,
&c., would require scores of years and legions of designers. By the
assistance of the Daguerreotype, a single man could finish that immense
work.’--This instrument lays down objects, which the visual organs
of man would overlook, or might be unable to perceive, with the same
minuteness and nicety, that it delineates the most prominent features
of a landscape. The time-stained excrescences on a tree, the blades
of grass, the leaf of a rose, the neglected weed, the moss on the
summit of a lofty tower, and similar objects, are traced with the same
accuracy as the larger objects in the surrounding scene.

It is not improbable, likewise, that this art (still in its
infancy) when it approximates to perfection, may enable us to take
representations of the sublime objects in the heavens. The sun affords
sufficient light for this purpose; and there appears no insurmountable
obstacle in taking, in this way, a highly magnified picture of that
luminary, which shall be capable of being again magnified by a powerful
microscope. It is by no means improbable, from experiments that have
hitherto been made, that we may obtain an accurate delineation of
the lunar world from the moon herself. The plated disks prepared by
Daguerre receive impressions from the action of the lunar rays to such
an extent as permits the hope that photographic charts of the moon
may soon be obtained; and, if so, they will excel in accuracy all the
delineations of this orb that have hitherto been obtained; and if they
should bear a microscopic power, objects may be perceived on the lunar
surface which have hitherto been invisible. Nor is it impossible that
the planets Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn, may be delineated in
this way, and objects discovered which cannot be descried by means of
the telescope. It might perhaps be considered as beyond the bounds of
probability to expect that even distant _Nebulæ_, might thus be fixed,
and a delineation of their objects produced which shall be capable of
being magnified by microscopes. But we ought to consider that the art
is yet only in its infancy--that plates of a more delicate nature than
those hitherto used, may yet be prepared, and that other properties of
light may yet be discovered, which shall facilitate such designs. For,
we ought now to set no boundaries to the discoveries of science, and to
the practical applications of scientific discovery which genius and art
may accomplish.

In short, this invention leads to the conclusion, that we have
not yet discovered all the wonderful properties of that Luminous
Agent which pervades the universe, and which unveils to us its
beauties and sublimities--and that thousands of admirable objects
and agencies may yet be disclosed to our view through the medium of
light, as philosophical investigators advance in their researches
and discoveries. In the present instance, as well as in many others,
it evidently appears, that the Creator intends, in the course of his
providence, by means of scientific researches, gradually to open to the
view of the inhabitants of our world the wonders, the beauties and the
sublimities of his vast creation, to manifest his infinite wisdom, and
his superabundant goodness, and to raise our souls to the contemplation
and the love of Him who is the original source of all that is glorious
and beneficent in the scene of nature.




CHAPTER III.


ON THE OPTICAL ANGLE, AND THE APPARENT MAGNITUDE OF OBJECTS.

In order to understand the principle on which telescopes represent
distant objects as magnified, it may be expedient to explain what is
meant by the angle of vision, and the apparent magnitudes under which
different objects appear, and the same object, when placed at different
distances.

[Illustration: _figure 40_*.]

The optical angle is the angle contained under two right lines drawn
from the extreme points of an object to the eye. Thus AEB or CED (fig.
40.) is the optical or visual angle, or the angle under which the
object AB or CD, appears to the eye at E. These two objects, being at
different distances, are seen under the same angle, although CD is
evidently larger than AB. On the retina of the eye, their images are
exactly of the same size, and so is the still larger object FG.

[Illustration: _figure 41._]

The _apparent magnitude_ of objects denotes their magnitude as they
appear to us, in contradistinction from their real or true magnitude,
and it is measured by the visual angle; for whatever objects are seen
under the same or equal angles _appear_ equal, however different their
real magnitudes. If a half-crown or half-dollar be placed at about 120
yards from the eye, it is just perceptible as a visible point, and its
apparent magnitude, or the angle under which it is seen, is very small.
At the distance of thirty or forty yards, its bulk appears sensibly
increased, and we perceive it to be a round body; at the distance
of six or eight yards, we can see the king or queen’s head engraved
upon it; and at the distance of eight or ten inches from the eye it
will appear so large, that it will seem to cover a large building
placed within the distance of a quarter of a mile, in other words, the
apparent magnitude of the half-crown held at such a distance, will more
than equal that of such a building, in the picture on the retina, owing
to the increase of the optical angle. If we suppose A (fig. 41.) to
represent the apparent size of the half-crown at nine yards distance,
then we say it is seen under the small angle FED. B will represent its
apparent magnitude at 4-1/2 yards distant under the angle HEG, and the
circle C, its apparent magnitude at 3 yards distant, under the large
angle KEI.

[Illustration: _figure 42._]

This may be otherwise illustrated by the following figure. Let AB (fig.
42.) be an object viewed directly by the eye QR. From each extremity A
and B draw the lines AN,BM, intersecting each other in the crystalline
humour in I: then is AIB the optical angle which is the measure of the
apparent magnitude or length of the object AB. From an inspection of
this figure, it will evidently appear that the apparent magnitudes of
objects will vary according to their distances. Thus AB, CD, EF, the
real magnitudes of which are unequal, may be situated at such distances
from the eye, as to have their _apparent_ magnitudes all equal, and
occupying the same space on the retina MN, as here represented. In like
manner, objects of equal magnitude, placed at unequal distances, will
appear unequal. The objects AB and GH which are equal, being situated
at different distances from the eye, GH will appear under the large
angle TIV, or as large as an object TV, situated at the same place as
the object AB, while AB appears under the smaller angle AIB. Therefore
the object GH is _apparently_ greater than the object AB, though it is
only equal to it. Hence it appears that we have no certain standard of
the _true magnitude_ of objects, by our visual perception abstractly
considered, but only of the _proportions_ of magnitude.

In reference to apparent magnitudes, we scarcely ever judge any object
to be so great or so small as it appears to be, or that there is so
great a disparity in the visible magnitude of two equal bodies at
different distances from the eye. Thus, for example, suppose two men,
each six feet 3 inches high, to stand directly before us, one at the
distance of a pole, or 5-1/2 yards, and the other at the distance of
100 poles, or 550 yards--we should observe a considerable difference in
their apparent size, but we should scarcely suppose, at first sight,
that the one nearest the eye appeared a hundred times greater than the
other, or that, while the nearest one appeared 6 feet 3 inches high,
the remote one appeared only about _three fourths of an inch_. Yet
such is in reality the case; and not only so, but the visible bulk
or area of the one is to that of the other, as the square of these
numbers, namely as 10,000 to 1; the man nearest us presenting to the
eye a magnitude or surface ten thousand times greater than that of the
other. Again, suppose two chairs standing in a large room, the one
21 feet distance from us, and the other 3 feet--the one nearest us
will appear 7 times larger both in length and breadth, than the more
distant one, and consequently, its visible area 49 times greater. If
I hold up my finger at 9 inches distant from my eye, it seems to cover
a large town a mile and a half in extent, situated at 3 miles distant;
consequently, the apparent magnitude of my finger, at 9 inches distant
from the organ of vision, is greater than that of the large town at 3
miles distance, and forms a larger picture on the retina of the eye.
When I stand at the distance of a foot from my window, and look through
one of the panes to a village less than a quarter of a mile distant,
I see, through that pane, nearly the whole extent of the village,
comprehending two or three hundred houses; consequently, the apparent
magnitude of the pane is equal to nearly the extent of the village,
and all the buildings it contains do not appear larger than the pane
of glass in the window, otherwise, the houses and other objects which
compose the village could not be seen through that single pane. For, if
we suppose a line drawn from one end of the village, passing through
the one side of the pane, and another line drawn from the other end,
and passing through the other side of the pane to the eye, these lines
would form the optical angle under which the pane of glass and the
village appears. If the pane of glass be fourteen inches broad, and
the length of the village 2640 yards, or half a mile--this last lineal
extent is 6,788 times greater than the other, and yet they have the
same _apparent_ magnitude in the case supposed.

Hence we may learn the absurdity and futility of attempting to
describe the extent of spaces in the heavens, by saying, that a
certain phenomenon was two or three feet or yards distant from
another, or that the tail of a comet appeared several yards in length.
Such representations can convey no definite ideas in relation to
such magnitudes, unless it be specified at what distance from the
eye, the foot or yard is supposed to be placed. If a rod, a yard
in length, be held at nine inches from the eye, it will subtend an
angle, or cover a space in the heavens, equal to more than one fourth
of the circumference of the sky, or about one hundred degrees. If
it be eighteen inches from the eye, it will cover a space equal to
fifty degrees; if at three feet, twenty-five degrees, and so on in
proportion to the distance from the eye; so that we can form no correct
conceptions of apparent spaces or distances in the heavens, when we
are merely told that two stars, for example, appear to be three yards
distant from each other. The only definite measure we can use, in such
cases, is that of degrees. The sun and moon are about half a degree
in apparent diameter, and the distance between the extreme stars in
_Orion’s belt_, three degrees, which measures being made familiar
to the eye, may be applied to other spaces of the heavens, and an
approximate idea conveyed of the relative distances of objects in the
sky.

From what has been stated above, it is evident that the magnitude
of objects may be considered in different points of view. The true
dimensions of an object, considered in itself, give what is called its
_real_ or _absolute magnitude_; and the opening of the visual angle
determines the _apparent magnitude_. The real magnitude, therefore, is
a constant quantity; but the apparent magnitude varies continually with
the distance, real or imaginary; and therefore, if we always judged
of the dimensions of an object from its apparent magnitude, every
thing around us would, in this respect, be undergoing very sensible
variations, which might lead us into strange and serious mistakes. A
fly, near enough to the eye, might appear under an angle as great as
an elephant at the distance of twenty feet, and the one be mistaken for
the other. A giant eight feet high, seen at the distance of twenty-four
feet, would not appear taller than a child two feet in height, at the
distance of six feet; for both would be seen nearly under the same
angle. But our experience generally prevents us from being deceived by
such illusions. By the help of touch, and by making allowance for the
different distances at which we see particular objects, we learn to
correct the ideas we might otherwise form from attending to the optical
angle alone, especially in the case of objects that are near us. By the
sense of touch we acquire an impression of the distance of an object;
this impression combines itself with that of the apparent magnitude,
so that the impression which represents to us the real magnitude is
the product of these two elements. When the objects, however, are at
a great distance, it is more difficult to form a correct estimate
of their true magnitudes. The visual angles are so small, that they
prevent comparison; and the estimated bulks of the objects depend in
a great measure upon the _apparent_ magnitudes; and thus an object
situated at a great distance, appears to us much smaller than it is
in reality. We also estimate objects to be nearer or farther distant
according as they are more or less clear, and our perception of them
more or less distinct and well defined; and likewise, when several
objects intervene between us and the object we are particularly
observing. We make a sort of addition of all the estimated distances
of intermediate objects, in order to form a total distance of the
remote object, which in this case appears to be farther off than if the
intervening space were unoccupied. It is generally estimated that no
terrestrial object can be distinctly perceived, if the visual angle it
subtends be less than _one minute of a degree_; and that most objects
become indistinct, when the angle they subtend at the pupil of the eye
is less than six minutes.

We have deemed it expedient to introduce the above remarks on the
apparent magnitude of objects, because the principal use of a telescope
is to increase the angle of vision, or to represent objects under a
larger angle than that under which they appear to the naked eye, so as
to render the view of distant objects more distinct, and to exhibit to
the organ of vision those objects which would otherwise be invisible.
A telescope may be said to enlarge an object just as many times as the
angle under which the instrument represents it, is greater than that
under which it appears to the unassisted eye. Thus the moon appears to
the naked eye under an angle of about half a degree; consequently a
telescope magnifies 60 times if it represents that orb under an angle
of 30 degrees; and if it magnified 180 times, it would exhibit the moon
under an angle of 90 degrees, which would make her appear to fill half
of the visible heavens, or the space which intervenes from the horizon
to the zenith.




CHAPTER IV.


ON THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF REFRACTING TELESCOPES.

There are two kinds of telescopes, corresponding to two modes of
vision, namely, those which perform their office by _refraction_
through lenses, and those which magnify distant objects by _reflection_
from mirrors. The telescope which is constructed with lenses, produces
its effects solely by refracted light, and is called a Dioptric, _or
refracting telescope_. The other kind of telescope produces its effects
partly by reflection, and partly by refraction, and is composed both
of mirrors and lenses; but the mirrors form the principal part of the
telescope; and therefore such instruments are denominated _reflecting
telescopes_. In this chapter I shall describe the various kinds of
_refracting_ telescopes.


SECT 1.--THE GALILEAN TELESCOPE.

This telescope is named after the celebrated Galileo, who first
constructed, and probably _invented_ it in the year 1609. It consists
of only two glasses, a _convex_ glass next the object, and a _concave_
next the eye. The convex is called the _object-glass_, and the concave
to which the eye is applied, is called the _eye-glass_. Let C (fig.
43.) represent the convex object-glass, presented to any object in the
direction DEI, so that the rays fall parallel upon it;--if these rays,
after passing through it, were not intercepted by the concave lens
K, they would pass on, and cross each other in the focus F, where an
inverted image of the object would be formed. But the concave lens K,
the virtual focus of which is at F, being interposed, the rays are not
suffered to converge to that point, but are made less convergent,[19]
and enter the pupil almost parallel, as GH, and are converged by the
humours of the eye to their proper foci on the retina. The object,
through this telescope, is seen upright, or in its natural position,
because the rays are not suffered to come to a focus, so as to form an
inverted picture. The concave eye-glass is placed as far within the
focus of the object-glass, as is equal to its own virtual focus; and
the magnifying power is as the focal length of the object-glass to
that of the eye-glass, that is, as CF to BF. Thus, suppose the focus of
the object-glass to be 10 inches, and the focus of the eye-glass to be
1 inch, the magnifying power will be 10 times--which is always found by
dividing the focal length of the object-glass by that of the eye-glass.
The interval between the two glasses, in this case, will be 9 inches,
which is the length of the telescope, and the objects seen through it
will appear under an angle ten times greater than they do to the naked
eye. These propositions might be proved mathematically; but the process
is somewhat tedious and intricate, and might not fully be understood
by general readers. I shall therefore only mention some of the general
properties of this telescope, which is now seldom used, except for the
purpose of _opera-glasses_.

[Illustration: _figure 43_]

1. The focal distance of the object-glass must be greater than that of
the eye-glass, otherwise it would not magnify an object: if the focal
distance of the eye-glass were greater than that of the object-glass,
it would diminish objects, instead of magnifying them. 2. The visible
area of the object is greater, the nearer the eye is to the glass; and
it depends on the diameter of the pupil of the eye, and on the breadth
of the object-glass; consequently the field of view in this telescope
is very small. 3. The distinctness of vision in this construction
of a telescope exceeds that of almost any other. This arises from
the rays of light proceeding from the object directly through the
lenses, _without crossing_ or intersecting each other; whereas in the
combination of convex lenses, they intersect one another to form an
image in the focus of the object-glass, and this image is magnified by
the eye-glass with all its imperfections and distortions. The thinness
of the centre of the concave lens also contributes to distinctness.
4. Although the field of view in this telescope is very small, yet
where no other telescope can be procured, it might be made of such a
length as to show the spots on the Sun, the crescent of Venus, the
satellites of Jupiter, and the ring of Saturn; and, requiring only two
glasses, it is the cheapest of all telescopes. It has been found that
an object-lens 5 feet focal distance, will bear a concave eye-glass of
only 1 inch focal distance, and will consequently magnify the diameters
of the planets 60 times, and their surfaces 3600 times, which is
sufficient to show the phenomena now stated. And, although only a small
portion of the sun and moon can be seen at once, yet Jupiter and all
his satellites may sometimes be seen at one view; but there is some
difficulty in finding objects with such telescopes. 5. Opera-glasses,
which are always of this construction, have the object-lens generally
about 6 inches focus and 1 inch diameter, with a concave eye-glass of
about 2 inches focus. These glasses magnify about 3 times in diameter,
have a pretty large field, and produce very distinct vision. When
adjusted to the eye, they are about 4 inches in length. To the object
end of an opera-glass there is sometimes attached a plane mirror,
placed at an angle of 45 degrees, for the purpose of viewing objects on
either side of us. By this means, in a theatre or assembly, we can take
a view of any person without his having the least suspicion of it, as
the glass is directed in quite a different direction. The instrument
with this appendage is sometimes called a _Polemoscope_.


SECT. 2.--THE COMMON ASTRONOMICAL REFRACTING TELESCOPE.

The astronomical telescope is the most simple construction of a
telescope, composed of convex lenses only, of which there are but
two essentially necessary, though a third is sometimes added to
the eye-piece for the purpose of enlarging the field of view. Its
construction will be easily understood from a description of the
following figure. Its two essential parts are, an object-glass AD,
and an eye-glass EY, so combined in a tube that the focus F of the
object-glass is exactly coincident with the focus of the eye-glass.
Let OB (fig. 44.) represent a distant object, from which rays nearly
parallel proceed to the object-lens AD. The rays passing through this
lens will cross at F, and form an image of the object at IM. This image
forms as it were an object to the eye-glass EY, which is of a short
focal distance, and the eye is thus enabled to contemplate the object
as if it were brought much nearer than it is in reality. For the rays,
which after crossing proceed in a divergent state, fall upon the lens
EY, as if they proceeded from a real object situated at F. All that
is effected therefore, by such a telescope is, to form an image of
a distant object by means of the object-lens, and then to give the
eye such assistance as is necessary for viewing that image as near as
possible, so that the angle it shall subtend at the eye shall be very
large compared with the angle which the object itself would subtend in
the same situation.

[Illustration: _figure 44._]

Here it may be expedient to explain, 1. how this arrangement of glasses
shows distant objects distinctly, and 2. the reason why objects appear
magnified when seen through it. As to the first particular, it may be
proved as follows:--The rays OA and BD, which are parallel before they
fall upon the object-glass, are by this glass refracted and united
at its focus: In order, then, to distinct vision, the eye-glass must
re-establish the parallelism of the rays,--which is effected by placing
the eye-glass so that its focus may be at F, and consequently the rays
will proceed from it parallel to each other and fall upon the eye in
that direction. For distinct vision is produced by _parallel_ rays. 2.
The reason why the object appears magnified will appear, if we consider
that, if the eye viewed the object from the centre of the object-glass,
it would see it under the angle OCB; let OC and BC then be produced
to the focus of the glass, they will then limit the image IM formed
in the focus. If then, two parallel rays are supposed to proceed to
the eye-glass EY, they will be converged to its focus H, and the eye
will see the image under the angle EHY. The apparent magnitude of the
object, therefore, as seen by the naked eye, is to the magnitude of the
image as seen through the telescope, as OCB to EHY, or as the distance
CF to the distance FG, in other words, _as the focal length of the
object-glass to that of the eye-glass_.

It is obvious from the figure, that, through this telescope, all
objects will appear _inverted_; since the object OB is depicted by the
object-glass in an inverted position at IM, and in this position is
viewed by the eye-glass EY; and, therefore this kind of telescope is
not well adapted for viewing terrestrial objects, since it exhibits
the tops of trees, houses, and other objects as undermost, and the
heads of people as pointing downwards. But this circumstance is of
no consequence with respect to the heavenly bodies, since they are
round, and it can make little difference to an observer which side
of a globular body appears uppermost or undermost. All astronomical
refracting telescopes invert objects; but they are preferred to any
other telescopes, because they have few glasses, and consequently more
light. This telescope however, can be transformed into a common day
telescope for land objects, by the addition of two other eye-glasses,
as we shall afterwards explain; but in this case a quantity of light is
lost by refraction at each lens; for there is scarcely any transparent
substance that transmits all the rays of light that fall upon it.

The _magnifying power_ of this telescope is found _by dividing the
focal distance of the object-glass by the focal distance of the
eye-glass_: the quotient gives the magnifying power, or the number of
times that the object seen through the telescope, appears larger or
nearer than to the naked eye. Thus, for example, if the focal distance
of the object-glass be 28 inches, and the focal distance of the
eye-glass 1 inch, the magnifying power will be 28 times. If we would
enlarge the telescope and select an object-glass 10 feet, or 120 inches
focus, an eye-glass of 2 inches focal length might be applied, and
then the diameter of objects would be magnified 60 times, and their
surfaces 3600 times. If we would use an object-glass of 100 feet, it
would be necessary to select an eye-glass about 6 inches focus, and
the magnifying power would be 200 times, equal to 1200 inches divided
by 6. Since, then, the power of magnifying depends on the proportion
of the focal length of the object and eye-glasses, and this proportion
may be varied to any degree, it may seem strange to some that a short
telescope of this kind will not answer that purpose as well as a long
one. For instance, it may be asked why an object-glass of 10 feet
focus, may not be made to magnify as much, as one of 100 feet focal
length, by using an eye-glass of half an inch focus, in which case,
the magnifying power would be 240 times? But it is to be considered,
that if the power of magnifying be increased, while the length of the
telescope remains the same, it is necessary to diminish the focal
length of the eye-glass in the same proportion, and this cannot be
done on account of the great distortion and colouring which would then
appear in the image, arising both from the deep convexity of the lens
and the different refrangibility of the rays of light. It is found
that the length of common refracting telescopes must be increased in
proportion to the square of the increase of their magnifying power; so
that in order to magnify twice as much as before, with the same light
and distinctness, the telescope must be lengthened four times; to
magnify 3 times as much, 9 times; and to magnify four times as much,
sixteen times; that is--suppose a telescope of 3 feet to magnify 33
times,--in order to procure a power four times as great, or 132 times,
we must extend the telescope to the length of 48 feet, or 16 times the
length of the other. Much likewise depends upon the breadth or aperture
of the object-glass. If it be too small, there will not be sufficient
light to illuminate the object; and if it be too large, the redundance
of light will produce confusion in the image.

The following table, constructed originally by Huygens, and which I
have re-calculated and corrected, shows the linear aperture, the focal
distance of the eye-glass, and the magnifying power of astronomical
telescopes of different lengths, which may serve as a guide to those
who wish to construct telescopes of this description.

In the above table, the first column expresses the focal length of
the object-glass in feet; the second column, the diameter of the
aperture[20] of the object-glass, the third column, the focal distance
of the eye-glass, and the fourth, the magnifying power, which is found
by reducing the feet in the first column to inches, and dividing by the
numbers in the third column. From this table it appears that, in order
to obtain a magnifying power of 168 times, by this kind of telescope,
it is requisite to have an object-glass of 70 feet focal distance,
and an eye-glass five inches focus, and that the aperture of the
object-glass ought not to be more than about 4-1/2 inches diameter. To
obtain a power of 220 times requires a length of 120 feet.

The following is a summary view of the properties of this telescope. 1.
The object is always inverted. 2. The magnifying power is always in the
proportion of the focal distance of the object-glass to the eye-glass.
3. As the rays emerging from the eye-glass, should be rendered parallel
for every eye, there is a small sliding tube next the eye, which should
be pushed out or in till the object appears distinct. When objects
are pretty near, this tube requires to be pulled out a little. These
circumstances require to be attended to in all telescopes. 4. The
apparent magnitude of an object is the same wherever the eye be placed,
but the visible area, or field of view, is the greatest when the eye
is nearly at the focal distance of the eye-glass. 5. The visual angle
depends on the breadth of the eye-glass; for it is equal to the angle
which the eye-glass subtends at the object-glass; but the breadth of
the eye-glass cannot be increased beyond a certain limit, without
producing colouring and distortion.

If the general principles on which this telescope is constructed
be thoroughly understood, it will be quite easy for the reader to
understand the construction of all the other kinds of telescopes,
whether refracting or reflecting. A small astronomical telescope can be
constructed in a few moments, provided one has at hand the following
lenses:--1. A common reading-glass, eight or ten inches focal distance;
2. A common magnifying lens, such as watchmakers or botanists use, of
about 1-1/2 or 2 inches focus. Hold the reading-glass--suppose of ten
inches focus--in the left hand opposite any object, and the magnifying
lens of two inches focus, in the right hand near the eye, at twelve
inches distance from the other in a direct line, and a telescope is
formed which magnifies five times. I have frequently used this plan,
when travelling, when no other telescope was at hand.


SECT. 3.--THE AERIAL TELESCOPE.

The Aerial is a refracting telescope of the kind we have now described,
intended to be used without a tube in a dark night; for the use of a
tube is not only to direct the glasses, but to make the place dark
where the images are formed. It appears from the preceding table
inserted above, that we cannot obtain a high magnifying power, with
the common astronomical telescope, without making it of an extreme
length, in which case the glasses are not manageable in tubes--which
are either too slight and apt to bend, or too heavy and unwieldy if
made of wood, iron or other strong materials. The astronomers of the
seventeenth century, feeling such inconveniences in making celestial
observations with long tubes, contrived a method of using the glasses
without tubes. Hartsocker, an eminent optician, contrived to fix
them at the top of a tree, a high wall, or the roof of a house; but
the celebrated Huygens, who was not only an astronomer, but also an
excellent mechanic, made considerable improvements in the method of
using an object-glass without a tube. He placed it at the top of a
very long pole, having previously enclosed it in a short tube, which
was made to turn in all directions by means of a ball and socket. The
axis of this tube he could command with a fine silken string, so as
to bring it into a line with the axis of another short tube which he
held in his hand, and which contained the eye-glass. The following is
a more particular description of one of these telescopes. On the top
of a long pole or mast _ab_ (fig. 45), is fixed a board moveable up
and down in the channel _cd_: _e_ is a perpendicular arm fixed to it,
and _ff_ is a transverse board that supports the object glass enclosed
in the tube _i_, which is raised or lowered by means of the silk cord
_rl_; _gg_ is an endless rope with a weight _h_, by which the apparatus
of the object-glass is counterpoised; _kl_ is a stick fastened to the
tube _i_; _m_ the ball and socket, by means of which the object-glass
is moveable every way: and to keep it steady, there is a weight _n_
suspended by a wire; _l_ is a short wire to which the thread _rl_ is
tied; _o_ is the tube which holds the eye-glass; _q_ the stick fixed
to this tube, _s_ a leaden bullet, and _t_ a spool to wind the thread
on; _u_ is pins for the thread to pass through; _x_ the rest for the
observer to lean upon, and _y_ the lantern. Fig. 46 is an apparatus
contrived by M. de la Hire for managing the object-glass; but which it
would be too tedious particularly to describe. To keep off the dew from
the object-glass, it was sometimes included in a pasteboard tube, made
of spongy paper, to absorb the humidity of the air. And to find an
object more readily, a broad annulus of white pasteboard was put over
the tube that carried the eye-glass; upon which the image of the object
being painted, an assistant who perceived it, might direct the tube of
the eye-glass into its place.

[Illustration: _figure 45._]

[Illustration: _fig 46._]

Such was the construction of the telescopes with which Hevelius,
Huygens, Cassini, and other eminent astronomers of the seventeenth
century made their principal discoveries. With such telescopes,
Huygens discovered the fourth satellite of Saturn, and determined
that this planet was surrounded with a ring; and with the same kind
of instrument Cassini detected the first, second, third, and fifth,
satellites of Saturn, and made his other discoveries. When the night
was very dark, they were obliged to make the object-glass visible,
by means of a lantern so constructed as to throw the rays of light
up to it in a parallel direction. In making such observations, they
must have taken incredible pains, endured much cold and fatigue,
and subjected themselves to very great labour and expense--which
almost makes us wonder at the discoveries they were instrumental in
bringing to light--and should make modern philosophers sensible of the
obligations they are under to such men as Newton and Dollond, through
whose inventions such unwieldy instruments are no longer necessary.
Telescopes of the description now stated were made of all sizes,
from 30 to above 120 feet in length. Divini at Rome, and Campani at
Bologna, were famed as makers of the object-glasses of the long focal
distance to which we have alluded, who sold them for a great price,
and took every method to keep the art of making them a secret. It was
with telescopes made by Campani, that Cassini made his discoveries.
They were made by the express order of Louis XIV, and were of 86, 100,
and 136 Paris feet in focal length. M. Auzout made one object-glass
of 600 feet focus; but he was never able to manage it, so as to make
any practical observations with it. Hartsocker is said to have made
some of a still greater focal length. The famous aerial telescope of
Huygens was 123 feet in focal length, with six inches of aperture. At
his death, he bequeathed it to the Royal Society of London, in whose
possession it still remains. It required a pole of more than a hundred
feet high, on which to place the object-glass for general observations.
It was with this glass, that Dr. Derham made the observations to which
he alludes in his preface to his ‘Astro-Theology.’ When this glass
was in the possession of Mr. Cavendish, it was compared with one of
Mr. Dollond’s forty-six inch treble object-glass Achromatics, and the
gentlemen who were present at the trial, said that ‘the Dwarf was
fairly a match for the Giant.’ It magnified 218 times, and the trouble
of managing it, was said to be extremely tiresome and laborious.


SECT. 4.--THE COMMON REFRACTING TELESCOPE FOR TERRESTRIAL OBJECTS.

[Illustration: _figure 47._]

This telescope is constructed on the same principle as the astronomical
telescope already described, with the addition of two or three glasses.
In fig. 47, OB represents a distant object, LN, the object glass, which
forms the image IM in its focus, which is, of course, in an inverted
position, and, if the eye were applied at the lens EE, the object would
appear, exactly as through the astronomical telescope, every object
being apparently turned upside down. To remedy this inconvenience,
there are added two other glasses FF and GG, by which a second image is
formed from the first, in the same position as the object. In order to
effect this, the first of these two glasses, namely FF, is placed at
twice its focal distance from the former glass EE, and the other lens
GG, next the eye, is placed at the same distance from FF. For all the
three glasses are supposed to be of the same focal distance. Now, the
lens FF, being placed at twice the focal distance for parallel rays
from EE, receives the pencils of parallel rays after they have crossed
each other at X, and forms an image at _i m_ similar to that at IM and
equal to it, but contrary in position, and consequently erect; which
last image is viewed by the lens GG, in the same manner as the first
image IM would be viewed by the lens EE. In this case, the image IM is
considered as an object to the lens FF of which it forms a picture in
its focus, in a reverse position from that of the first image, and of
course, in the same position as the object.

The magnifying power of this telescope is determined precisely in
the same way as that of the astronomical telescope. Suppose the
object-glass to be thirty inches focal distance, and each of the
eye-glasses 1-1/2 inch focal distance, the magnifying power is in the
proportion of 30 to 1-1/2, or 20 times, and the instrument is, of
course, considerably longer than an astronomical telescope of the same
power. The distance, in this case, between the object-glass and the
first eye-glass EE is 31-1/2 inches; the distance between EE, and the
second glass FF, is 3 inches, and the distance between FF and the glass
GG next the eye, 3 inches; in all 37-1/2 inches, the whole length of
the telescope. Although it is usual to make use of three eye-glasses in
this telescope, yet two will cause the object to appear erect, and of
the same magnitude. For suppose the middle lens FF taken away, if the
first lens EE be placed at X, which is double its focal distance from
the image IM, it will at the same distance X _m_, on the other side,
form a secondary image _i m_ equal to the primary image IM, and also in
a contrary position. But such a combination of eye-glasses produces a
great degree of colouring in the image, and therefore is seldom used.
Even the combination now described, consisting of three lenses of equal
focal distances, is now almost obsolete, and has given place to a much
better arrangement consisting of _four_ glasses, of different focal
distances--which shall be afterwards described.

The following figures, 48, 49, 50 represent the manner in which the
rays of light are refracted through the glasses of the telescopes we
have now described. Fig. 48 represents the rays of light as they pass
from the object to the eye in the Galilean telescope. After passing in
a parallel direction to the object-glass, they are refracted by that
glass, and undergo a slight convergence in passing towards the concave
eye-glass, where they enter the eye in a parallel direction, but no
image is formed previous to their entering the eye, till they arrive
at the retina. Fig. 49 represents the rays as they pass through the
glasses of the astronomical telescope. The rays, after entering the
object-glass, proceed in a converging direction, till they arrive at
its focus, about A, where an image of the object is formed; they then
proceed diverging to the eye-glass, where they are rendered parallel,
and enter the eye in that direction. Fig. 50 represents the rays as
they converge and diverge in passing through the four glasses of
the common day-telescope described above. After passing through the
object-glass, they converge towards B, where the first image is formed.
They then diverge towards the first eye-glass where they are rendered
parallel; and passing through the second eye-glass, they again converge
and form a second image at C; from which point they again diverge,
and passing through the first eye-glass enter the eye in a parallel
direction. If the glasses of these telescopes were fixed on long pieces
of wood, at their proper distances from each other, and placed in a
darkened room, when the sun is shining, the beam of the sun’s light
would pass through them in the same manner as here represented.

SECT. 5.--TELESCOPE FORMED BY A SINGLE LENS.

This is a species of telescope altogether unnoticed by optical writers,
so far as I know; nor has the property of a single lens in magnifying
distant objects been generally adverted to or recognised. It may not
therefore be inexpedient to state a few experiments which I have made
in relation to this point. When we hold a spectacle-glass of a pretty
long focal distance--say, from 20 to 24 inches--close to the eye, and
direct it to distant objects, they do not appear sensibly magnified.
But if we hold the glass about 12 or 16 inches from our eye, we shall
perceive a sensible degree of magnifying power, as if distant objects
were seen at less than half the distance at which they are placed. This
property of a spectacle-glass I happened to notice when a boy, and, on
different occasions since that period have made several experiments on
the subject, some of which I shall here relate.

With the object-glass of a common refracting telescope 4-1/2 feet focal
distance, and 2-1/2 inches diameter, I looked at distant objects--my
eye being at about 3-1/2 feet from the lens, or about 10 or 12 inches
within its focus--and it produced nearly the same effect as a telescope
which magnifies the diameters of objects 5 or 6 times. With another
lens 11 feet focal distance and 4 inches diameter--standing from it at
the distance of about 10 feet, I obtain a magnifying power of about 12
or 14 times, which enables me to read the letters on the sign-posts
of a village half a mile distant. Having some time ago procured a
very large lens 26 feet focal distance, and 11-1/2 inches diameter,
I have tried with it various experiments of this kind upon different
objects. Standing at the distance of about 25 feet from it, I can see
distant objects through it magnified about 26 times in diameter, and
consequently 676 times in surface, and remarkably clear and distinct,
so that I can distinguish the hour and minute hands of a public clock
in a village two miles distant. This single lens, therefore answers the
purpose of an ordinary telescope with a power of 26 times. In making
such experiments our eye must always be _within_ the focus of the
lens, at least 8 or 10 inches. The object will, indeed, be seen at any
distance from the glass within this limit; but the magnifying power is
diminished in proportion as we approach nearer to the glass. Different
eyes, too, will require to place themselves at different distances, so
as to obtain the greatest degree of magnifying power with distinctness,
according as individuals are long or short-sighted.

This kind of telescope stands in no need of a tube, but only of a small
pedestal on which it may be placed on a table, nearly at the height
of the eye, and that it be capable of a motion in a perpendicular
or parallel direction, to bring it in a line with the eye and the
object. The principle on which the magnifying power, in this case, is
produced, is materially the same as that on which the performance of
the Galilean telescope depends. The eye of the observer serves instead
of the concave lens in that instrument; and as the concave lens is
placed as much within the focus of the object-glass, as is equal to
its own focal distance, so the eye, in these experiments, must be
placed at least its focal distance within the focus of the lens with
which we are experimenting; and the magnifying power will be nearly
in the proportion of the focal distance of the lens to the focal
distance of the eye. If, for example, the focal distance of the eye,
or the distance at which we see to read distinctly, be 10 inches, and
the focal distance of the lens, 11 feet, the magnifying power will
be as 11 feet, or 132 inches to 10, that is, about 13 times. Let A
(fig. 51.) represent the lens placed on a pedestal; the rays of light
passing through this lens from distant objects will converge towards a
focus at F. If a person then, place his eye at E, a certain distance
within the focal point, he will see distant objects magnified nearly in
the proportion of the focal distance of the lens to that of the eye;
and when the lens is very broad--such as the 26 feet lens mentioned
above--two or three persons may look through it at once, though they
will not all see the same object. I have alluded above to a lens made
by M. Azout of 600 feet focal distance. Were it possible to use such a
lens for distant objects, it might represent them as magnified 5 or 600
times, without the application of any eye-glass. In this way the aerial
telescope of Huygens would magnify objects above 100 times, which is
about half the magnifying power it produced with its eye-piece. Suppose
Azout’s lens had been fitted up as a telescope, it would not have
magnified above 480 times, as it would have required an eye-glass of 14
or 15 inches focal distance, whereas, without an eye-glass, it would
have magnified objects considerably above 500 times. It is not unlikely
that the species of telescope to which I have now adverted, constituted
one of those instruments for magnifying distant objects which were said
to have been in the possession of certain persons long before their
invention in Holland, and by Galileo in Italy--to which I have referred
in p. 182. Were this kind of telescope to be applied to the celestial
bodies, it would require to be elevated upon a pole in the manner
represented, fig. 45, p. 226.

[Illustration: _figure 51._]


SECT. 6.--THE ACHROMATIC TELESCOPE.

This telescope constitutes the most important and useful improvement
ever made upon telescopic instruments; and, it is probable, it will,
ere long, supersede the use of all other telescopes. Its importance and
utility will at once appear when we consider, that a good achromatic
telescope of only 4 or 5 feet in length will bear a magnifying power
as great, as that of a common astronomical telescope 100 feet long,
and even with a greater degree of distinctness, so that they are now
come into general use both for terrestrial and celestial observations.
There are, indeed, certain obstructions which prevent their being made
of a very large size; but from the improvement in the manufacture
of achromatic glass which is now going forward, it is to be hoped
that the difficulties which have hitherto impeded the progress of
opticians will soon be removed. In order to understand the nature
of this telescope, it will be necessary to advert a little to the
_imperfections_ connected with common refracting telescopes.

[Illustration: _figure 52._]

The first imperfection to which I allude is this, that _spherical
surfaces do not refract the rays of light accurately to a point_;
and hence the image formed by a single convex lens is not perfectly
accurate and distinct. The rays which pass near the extremities of such
a lens meet in foci nearer to the lens than those which pass nearly
through the centre, which may be illustrated by the following figure.
Let PP (fig. 52) be a convex lens and E_e_ an object, the point E of
which corresponds with the axis, and sends forth the rays EM, EN, EA,
&c., all of which reach the surface of the glass, but in different
parts. It is manifest that the ray EA which passes through the middle
of the glass, suffers no refraction. The rays EM, EM, likewise, which
pass through near to EA, will be converged to a focus at F, which we
generally consider as the focus of the lens. But the rays EN, EN, which
are nearer to the edge of the glass will be differently refracted, and
will meet about G, nearer to the lens, where they will form another
image G_g_. Hence, it is evident, that the first image F_f_, is formed
only by the union of those rays which pass very near the centre of the
lens; but as the rays of light proceeding from every point of an object
are very numerous, there is a succession of images formed, according
to the parts of the lens where they penetrate, which necessarily
produces indistinctness and confusion. This is the imperfection which
is distinguished by the name of _spherical aberration_, or the error
arising from the spherical form of lenses.

The second and most important imperfection of single lenses, when used
for the object-glasses of telescopes, is, that the rays of compounded
light being differently refrangible, come to their respective foci at
different distances from the glass; the more refrangible rays, as the
_violet_, converging sooner than those which are less refrangible, as
the _red_. I have had occasion to illustrate this circumstance, when
treating on the colours produced by the prism, (see p. 128, and figures
32 and 33,) and it is confirmed by the experiment of a paper painted
red, throwing its image, by means of a lens, at a greater distance
than another paper painted blue. From such facts and experiments, it
appears, that the image of a white object consists of an indefinite
number of coloured images, the violet being nearest, and the red
farthest from the lens, and the images of intermediate colours at
intermediate distances. The aggregate, or image itself, must therefore
be in some degree confused; and this confusion being much increased
by the magnifying power, it is found necessary to use an eye glass of
a certain limited convexity to a given object glass. Thus, an object
glass of 34 inches focal length will bear an eye-glass of only 1 inch
focus, and will magnify the diameters of objects 34 times; one of 50
feet focal distance will require an eye-glass of 4-1/2 inches focus,
and will magnify only 142 times; whereas, could we apply to it an
eye-glass of only 1 inch focus, as in the former case, it would magnify
no less than 600 times. And were we to construct an object-glass of 100
feet focal length, we should require to apply an eye-glass, not less
than 6 inches focus, which would produce a power of about 200 times;
so that there is no possibility of producing a great power by single
lenses, without extending the telescope to an immoderate length.

Sir Isaac Newton, after having made his discoveries respecting the
colours of light, considered the circumstance we have now stated as
an insuperable barrier to the improvement of refracting telescopes;
and therefore turned his attention to the improvement of telescopes
by _reflection_. In the telescopes which he constructed and partly
invented, the images of objects are formed by reflection from speculums
or mirrors; and being free from the irregular convergency of the
various coloured rays of light, will admit of a much larger aperture
and the application of a much greater degree of magnifying power. The
reflector which Newton constructed was only 6 inches long, but it was
capable of bearing a power equal to that of a 6 feet refractor. It was
a long time, however, after the invention of these telescopes before
they were made of a size fitted for making celestial observations.
After reflecting telescopes had been some time in use, Dollond made his
famous discovery of the principle which led him to the construction
of the _achromatic_ telescope. This invention consists of a compound
object glass formed of two different kinds of glass, by which both
the spherical aberration and the errors arising from the different
refrangibility of the rays of light are, in a great measure corrected.
For the explanation of the nature of this compound object glass and of
the effects it produces; it may be expedient to offer the following
remarks respecting the dispersion of light and its refraction by
different substances.

The _dispersion_ of light is estimated by the variable angle formed by
the red and violet rays which bound the solar spectrum;--or rather,
it is the excess of the refraction of the most refrangible ray above
that of the least refrangible ray. The dispersion is not proportional
to the refraction--that is, the substances which have an equal mean
refraction, do not _disperse_ light in the same ratio. For example,
if we make a prism with plates of glass, and fill it with oil of
Cassia, and adjust its refracting angle ACB, (fig. 31, p. 127,) so
that the middle of the spectrum which it forms falls exactly at the
same place where the green rays of a spectrum formed by a glass prism
would fall--then we shall find that the spectrum formed by the _oil
of Cassia_ prism will be two or three times _longer_ than that of the
_glass_ prism. The oil of Cassia, therefore, is said to _disperse_ the
rays of light more than the glass, that is, to separate the extreme
red and violet rays at O and P more than the mean ray at _green_, and
to have a greater _dispersive power_. Sir I. Newton appears to have
made use of prisms composed of different substances, yet, strange to
tell, he never observed that they formed spectrums, whose lengths were
different, when the refraction of the green ray was the same; but
thought that the dispersion was proportional to the refraction. This
error continued to be overlooked by philosophers for a considerable
time, and was the cause of retarding the invention of the achromatic
telescope for more than 50 years.

Dollond was among the first who detected this error. By his experiments
it appears, that the different kinds of glass differ extremely with
respect to the divergency of colours produced by equal refractions.
He found that two prisms, one of white flint glass, whose refracting
angle was about 25 degrees, and another of crown glass whose refracting
angle was about 29 degrees, refracted the beam of light nearly alike;
but that the divergency of colour in the white flint was considerably
more than in the crown glass; so that when they were applied together,
to refract contrary ways, and a beam of light transmitted through
them, though the emergent continued parallel to the incident part,
it was, notwithstanding, separated into component colours. From this
he inferred, that, in order to render the emergent beam white, it is
necessary that the refracting angle of the prism of crown glass should
be _increased_, and by repeated experiments he discovered the exact
quantity. By these means he obtained a theory in which refraction was
performed without any separation or divergency of colour; and thus the
way was prepared for applying the principle he had ascertained to the
construction of the object glasses of refracting telescopes. For the
edges of a convex and concave lens, when placed in contact with each
other, may be considered as two prisms which refract contrary ways;
and if the excess of refraction in the one be such as precisely to
destroy the divergency of colour in the other, a colourless image will
be formed. Thus, if two lenses are made of the same focal length, the
one of flint glass and the other of crown, the length or diameter of
the coloured image in the first will be to that produced by the crown
glass, as 3 to 2 nearly. Now, if we make the focal lengths of the
lenses in this proportion, that is, as 3 to 2, the coloured spectrum
produced by each will be equal. But if the flint lens be concave, and
the crown convex--when placed in contact--they will mutually correct
each other, and a pencil of white light refracted by the compound lens
will remain colourless.

[Illustration: _figure 53._]

The following figure may perhaps illustrate what has been now stated.
Let LL (fig. 53.) represent a convex lens of _crown glass_, and _ll_
a concave lens of _flint glass_. A ray of the sun S, falls at F on
the convex lens which will refract it exactly as the prism ABC, whose
faces touch the two surfaces of the lens at the points where the ray
enters and quits it. The solar ray, SF, thus refracted by the lens LL,
or prism ABC, would have formed a spectrum PT on the wall, had there
been no other lens, the violet ray F crossing the axis of the lens
at V, and going to the upper end P of the spectrum; and the red ray
FR, going to the lower end T. But as the flint-glass lens _ll_, or the
prism A_a_C which receives the rays FV, FR, at the same points, is
interposed, these rays will be united at _f_, and form a small circle
of white light; the ray SF of the sun being now refracted without
colour from its primitive direction SFY into the new direction F_f_.
In like manner the corresponding ray SM will be refracted to _f_,
and a white and colourless image of the sun will be there formed by
the two lenses. In this combination of lenses it is obvious that the
spherical aberration of the flint lens corrects to a considerable
degree that of the crown-glass, and by a proper adjustment of the radii
of the surfaces, it may be almost wholly removed. This error is still
more completely corrected in the _triple_ achromatic object-glass,
which consists of three lenses--a concave flint lens placed between
convexes of crown glass. Fig. 54 shows the _double_ achromatic lens,
and fig. 55, the _triple_ object-glass, as they are fitted up in their
cells, and placed at the object end of the telescope. In consequence
of their producing a focal image free of colour they will bear a
much larger aperture and a much greater magnifying power than common
refracting telescopes of the same length. While a common telescope
whose object-glass is 3-1/2 feet focal distance will bear an aperture
of scarcely 1 inch, the 3-1/2 feet Achromatic will bear an aperture
of 3-1/4 inches, and consequently transmits 10-1/2 times the quantity
of light. While the one can bear a magnifying power of only about 36
times, the other will bear a magnifying power for celestial objects of
more than 200 times.

The theory of the achromatic telescope is somewhat complicated and
abstruse, and would require a more lengthened investigation than my
limits will permit. But what has been already stated may serve to
give the reader a general idea of the _principle_ on which it is
constructed, which is all I intended. The term _achromatic_ by which
such instruments are now distinguished was first given to them by Dr.
Bevis. It is compounded of two Greek words which signify, ‘free of
colour.’ And, were it not that even philosophers are not altogether
free of that pedantry which induces us to select Greek words which
are unintelligible to the mass of mankind, they might have been
contented with selecting the plain English word _colourless_, which
is as significant and expressive as the Greek word _achromatic_. The
_crown-glass_, of which the convex lenses of this telescope are made,
is the same as good common window-glass; and the _flint-glass_ is that
species of glass of which wine-glasses, tumblers, decanters and similar
articles are formed, and is sometimes distinguished by the name of
crystal-glass. Some opticians have occasionally formed the concave
lens of an achromatic object-glass from the bottom of a broken tumbler.

This telescope was invented and constructed by Mr. John Dollond, about
the year 1758. When he began his researches into this subject, he was
a silk weaver in Spitalfields, London. The attempt of the celebrated
Euler to form a colourless telescope, by including water between two
meniscus glasses, attracted his attention, and, in the year 1753, he
addressed a letter to Mr. Short, the optician, which was published in
the Philosophical Transactions of London, ‘concerning a mistake in
Euler’s theorem for correcting the aberrations in the object glasses
of refracting telescopes.’ After a great variety of experiments on
the refractive and dispersive powers of different substances, he
at last constructed a telescope in which an exact balance of the
opposite dispersive powers of the crown and flint lenses made the
colours disappear, while the predominating refraction of the crown
lens disposed the achromatic rays to meet at a distant focus. In
constructing such object glasses, however, he had several difficulties
to encounter. In the first place, the focal distance as well as the
particular surfaces must be very nicely proportioned to the densities
or refractive powers of the glasses, which are very apt to vary in the
same sort of glass made at different times. In the next place, the
centers of the two glasses must be placed truly in the common axis of
the telescope, otherwise the desired effect will be in a great measure
destroyed. To these difficulties is to be added--that there are four
surfaces (even in double achromatic object glasses) to be wrought
perfectly spherical; and every person practised in optical operations
will allow, that there must be the greatest accuracy throughout the
whole work. But these and other difficulties were at length overcome by
the judgment and perseverance of this ingenious artist.

It appears, however, that Dollond was not the only person who had
the merit of making this discovery--a private gentleman, Mr. Chest,
of Chest-hall, a considerable number of years before, having made a
similar discovery, and applied it to the same purpose. This fact was
ascertained in the course of a process raised against Dollond at the
instance of Watkins, optician at Charing-cross, when applying for a
patent. But as the other gentleman had kept his invention a secret,
and Dollond had brought it forth for the benefit of the public, the
decision was given in his favour. There was no evidence that Dollond
borrowed the idea from his competitor, and both were, to a certain
extent, entitled to the merits of the invention.

One of the greatest obstructions to the construction of large
achromatic telescopes is, the difficulty of procuring large discs of
flint glass of an uniform refractive density--of good colour, and free
from veins. It is said that, fortunately for Mr. Dollond, this kind
of glass was procurable when he began to make achromatic telescopes,
though the attempts of ingenious chemists have since been exerted to
make it without much success. It is also said, that the glass employed
by Dollond in the fabrication of his best telescopes, was of the same
melting, or made at the same time, and that, excepting this particular
treasure, casually obtained, good dense glass for achromatic purposes,
was always as difficult to be procured as it is now. The dispersion of
the flint glass, too, is so variable, that, in forming an achromatic
lens, trials on each specimen require to be made before the absolute
proportional dispersion of the substances can be ascertained. It is
owing, in a great measure, to these circumstances, that a large and
good achromatic telescope cannot be procured unless at a very high
price. Mr. Tulley of Islington--who has been long distinguished as a
maker of excellent achromatic instruments--showed me, about six years
ago, a rude piece of flint glass about five inches diameter, intended
for the concave lens of an achromatic object glass, for which he paid
eight guineas. This was before the piece of glass was either figured
or polished, and, consequently, he had still to perform the delicate
operation of figuring, polishing, and adjusting this concave to the
convex lenses with which it was to be combined; and during the process
some veins or irregularities might be detected in the flint glass which
did not then appear. Some years before, he procured a disc of glass
from the continent about seven or eight inches diameter, for which he
paid about thirty guineas, with which an excellent telescope, twelve
feet focal length, was constructed for the Astronomical Society of
London. It is obvious therefore, that large achromatic telescopes must
be charged at a pretty high price.

In order to stimulate ingenious chemists and opticians to make
experiments on this subject, the Board of Longitude, more than half
a century ago, offered a considerable reward for bringing the art
of making good flint glass for optical purposes to the requisite
perfection. But considerable difficulties arise in attempting
improvements of this kind; as the experiments must all be tried on a
very large scale, and are necessarily attended with a heavy expence.
And although government has been extremely liberal in voting money for
warlike purposes, and in bestowing pensions on those who stood in no
need of them, it has hitherto thrown an obstruction in the way of such
experiments, by the heavy duty of excise, which is rigorously exacted,
whether the glass be manufactured into saleable articles or not; and
has thus been instrumental in retarding the progress of improvement
and discovery. It would appear that experiments of this kind have
been attended with more success in France, Germany, and other places
on the continent, than in Britain; as several very large achromatic
telescopes have been constructed in those countries by means of flint
glass which was cast for the purpose in different manufactories, and
to which British artists have been considerably indebted; as the
London opticians frequently purchase their largest discs of flint
glass from Parisian agents. Guinaud, a continental experimenter, and
who was originally a cabinet maker, appears to have had his labours
in this department of art crowned with great success. Many years were
employed in his experiments, and he too frequently, notwithstanding all
his attention, discovered his metal to be vitiated by striæ, spects
or grains, with cometic tails. He constructed a furnace capable of
melting two _cwt_ of glass in one mass, which he sawed vertically,
and polished one of the sections, in order to observe what had taken
place during the fusion. From time to time, as he obtained blocks,
including portions of good glass, his practice was to separate them by
sawing the blocks into horizontal sections, or perpendicular to their
axes. A fortunate accident conducted him to a better process. While
his men were one day carrying a block of this glass, on a hand-barrow,
to a saw mill which he had erected at the Fall of the Doubs, the
mass slipped from its bearers, and, rolling to the bottom of a steep
and rocky declivity, was broken to pieces. Guinaud having selected
those fragments which appeared perfectly homogeneous, softened them
in circular moulds, in such a manner, that on cooling, he obtained
discs that were afterwards fit for working. To this method he adhered,
and contrived a way for clearing his glass while cooling, so that the
fractures should follow the most faulty parts. When flaws occurred in
the large masses, they were removed by cleaving the pieces with wedges;
then smelting them again in moulds, which give them the form of discs.
The Astronomical Society of London have made trial of discs made by
Guinaud, and have found them entirely homogeneous and free from fault.
Of this ingenious artist’s flint glass, some of the largest achromatic
telescopes on the continent have been constructed. But, it is more
than twenty years since this experimenter took his flight from this
terrestrial scene, and it is uncertain whether his process be still
carried on with equal success.


_Notices of some large Achromatic telescopes on the Continent and in
Great Britain._

1. _The Dorpat Telescope._--This is one of the largest and most
expensive Refracting telescopes ever constructed. It was made by
the celebrated Fraunhofer of Munich for the observatory of the
Imperial University of Dorpat, and was received into the observatory
by Professor Struve in the year 1825. The aperture of the object
glass of this telescope is 9-1/2 English inches, and its solar focal
length about fourteen feet, the main tube being thirteen French feet
exclusive of the tube which holds the eye pieces. The smallest of the
four magnifying powers it possesses, is 175, and the largest 700,
which, in favourable weather, is said to present the object with the
utmost precision. ‘This instrument,’ says Struve, ‘was sold to us by
Privy-Counsellor VON UTZCHNEIDER, the chief of the optical
establishment at Munich, for 10,500 florins, (about £950 sterling), a
price which only covers the expenses which the establishment incurred
in making it.’ The frame work of the stand of this telescope is of oak
inlaid with pieces of mahogany in an ornamental manner, and the tube is
of deal veneered with mahogany and highly polished. The whole weight
of the telescope and its counterpoises is supported at one point, at
the common center of gravity of all its parts; and though these weigh
3000 Russian pounds, yet, we are told that this enormous telescope may
be turned in every direction towards the heavens with more ease and
certainty than any other hitherto in use. When the object end of the
telescope is elevated to the zenith, it is sixteen feet four inches,
Paris measure, above the floor, and its eye end in this position is
two feet nine inches high. This instrument is mounted on an Equatorial
stand, and clock work is applied to the Equatorial axis, which gives it
a smooth and regular sidereal motion, which, it is said, keeps a star
in the exact center of the field of view, and produces the appearance
of a state of rest in the starry regions, which motion can be made
solar, or even lunar, by a little change given to the place of a
pointer, that is placed as an index on the dial plate. Professor Struve
considers the optical powers of this telescope superior to those of
Schröeter’s twenty-five feet reflector, from having observed σ Orionis
with fifteen companions, though Schröeter observed only twelve, that
he could count with certainty. Nay, he seems disposed to place it in
competition with the late Sir W. Herschel’s forty feet reflector. The
_finder_ of this telescope has a focal distance of 30 French inches,
and 2-42 aperture.

2. _Sir James South’s Telescope._--About the year 1829, Sir J.
South, President of the London Astronomical Society, procured of M.
Cauchoix of Paris, an achromatic object glass of 11-2/10 inches, clear
aperture, and of 19 feet focal length. The flint glass employed in its
construction was the manufacture of the late Guinaud le Pere, and was
found to be absolutely perfect. The first observation was made with
this telescope, while on a temporary stand, on Feb. 13, 1830, when Sir
J. Herschel discovered with it a _sixth_ star in the trapezium in the
nebula of Orion, whose brightness was about one third of that of the
fifth star discovered by Struve, which is as distinctly seen as the
companion to Polaris is in a five feet achromatic. Sir James gives the
following notices of the performance of this instrument on the morning
of May 14, 1830. ‘At half past two, placed the 20 feet achromatic on
the Georgium Sidus, saw it with a power of 346, a beautiful planetary
disc; not the slightest suspicion of any ring, either perpendicular or
horizontal; but the planet three hours east of the meridian, and the
moon within three degrees of the planet.’ At a quarter before three,
viewed _Jupiter_ with 252 and 346, literally covered with belts, and
the diameters of his satellites might have been as easily measured
as himself. One came from behind the body, and the contrast of the
colour with that of the planet’s limb was striking. At three o’clock
viewed _Mars_. The contrast of light in the vicinity of the poles very
decided. Several spots on his body well and strongly marked--that about
the south pole seems to overtake the body of the planet, and gives an
appearance not unlike that afforded by the new moon, familiarly known
as ‘the old moon in the new moon’s arms.’ _Saturn_ has been repeatedly
seen with powers from 130 to 928 under circumstances the most
favourable; but not any thing anomalous about the planet or its ring
could even be suspected. This telescope is erected on an Equatorial
stand at Sir J. South’s observatory, Kensington.

3. _Captain Smyth’s Telescope in his private observatory at
Bedford._--This Achromatic telescope is 8-1/2 feet focal length, with a
clear aperture of 5-9/10 inches worked by the late Mr. Tulley, Senior,
from a disk purchased by Sir James South at Paris. It is considered
by Captain Smyth to be the finest specimen of that eminent optician’s
skill, and, it is said, will bear with distinctness, a magnifying
power of 1200. Its distinctness has been proved by the clear vision
it gives of the obscure nebulæ, and of the companions of Polaris,
Rigel, α Lyræ, and the most minute double stars---the lunar mountains,
cavities and shadows under all powers--the lucid polar regions of
Mars--the sharpness of the double ring of Saturn--the gibbous aspect
of Venus--the shadows of Jupiter’s satellites across his body, and
the splendid contrast of colours in α Hercules, γ Andromedæ and other
superb double stars.

_Other large Achromatics._--Besides the above, the following, belonging
to public observatories and private individuals, may be mentioned. In
the Royal observatory at Greenwich, there is an Achromatic of 10 feet
focal distance, having a double object glass 5 inches diameter, which
was made by Mr. Peter Dollond, and the only one of that size he ever
constructed. There is also a 46 inch achromatic, with a triple object
glass 3-3/4 inches aperture, which is said to be the most perfect
instrument of the kind ever produced. It was the favourite instrument
of Dr. Maskelyne, late Astronomer Royal, who had a small room fitted
up in the observatory for this telescope. The observatory, some years
ago erected near Cambridge, is perhaps the most splendid structure of
the kind in Great Britain. It is furnished with several very large
achromatic telescopes on Equatorial machinery: but the Achromatic
telescope, lately presented to it by the Duke of Northumberland, is
undoubtedly the largest instrument of this description which is to be
found in this country. The object glass is said to be 25 feet focal
distance, and of a corresponding diameter, but as there was no access
to this instrument at the time I visited this observatory, nearly six
years ago, I am unable to give a particular description of it. In
the Royal Observatory at Paris, which I visited in 1837, I noticed,
among other instruments, two very large Achromatic telescopes which,
measuring them rudely by the eye--I estimated to be from 15 to 18
feet long, and the aperture at the object end, from 12 to 15 inches
diameter. They were the largest achromatics I had previously seen; but
I could find no person in the observatory at that time, who could give
me any information as to their history, or to their exact dimensions,
or powers of magnifying.[21]

The Rev. Dr. Pearson, Treasurer to the Astronomical Society of London,
is in possession of the telescope formerly alluded to, made by Mr.
Tulley, of twelve feet focal distance and seven inches aperture, which
is said to be a very fine one. The small star which accompanies the
pole star, with a power of a 100, appears through this telescope, as
distinct and steady as one of Jupiter’s satellites. With a single lens
of 6 inches focus, which produced a power of 24 times, according to
the testimony of an observer who noticed it--the small star appeared
as it does in an achromatic of 3 inches aperture, which shows the
great effect of illuminating power in such instruments. Mr. Lawson, a
diligent astronomical observer in Hereford, possesses a most beautiful
achromatic telescope of about 7 inches aperture, and 12 feet focal
distance, which was made by one of the Dollonds, who considered it
as his _chief d’oeuvre_. It is said to bear powers as high as 1100
or 1400; and has been fitted up with mechanism devised by Mr. Lawson
himself, so as to be perfectly easy and manageable to the observer,
and which displays this gentleman’s inventive talent. In several of
his observations with this instrument, he is said to have had a view
of some of the more minute subdivisions of the ring of Saturn. A very
excellent achromatic telescope was fitted up some years ago by my
worthy friend William Bridges, Esq., Blackheath. Its object glass is
5-1/2 inches diameter, and about 5-1/2 feet focal length. It is erected
upon Equatorial machinery, and placed in a circular observatory which
moves round with a slight touch of the hand. The object glass of this
instrument cost about 200 Guineas, the equatorial machinery on which it
is mounted cost 150 Guineas, and the circular observatory in which it
is placed about 100 Guineas; in all 450 Guineas. Its powers vary from
50 to 300 times.[22]


_Achromatic telescopes of a moderate size._

Such telescopes as I have alluded to above, are among the largest which
have yet been made on the achromatic principle; they are, of course,
comparatively rare, and can be afforded only at a very high price. Few
of the _object glasses_ in the telescopes to which I have referred,
would be valued at less than 200 Guineas, independently of the tubes,
eye pieces and other apparatus with which they are fitted up. It is so
difficult to procure large discs of flint glass for optical purposes,
to produce the requisite curves of the different lenses, and to combine
them together with that extreme accuracy which is requisite, that when
a good compound lens of this description is found perfectly achromatic,
the optician must necessarily set a high value upon it; since it may
happen that he may have finished half a dozen before he has got one
that is nearly perfect. The more common sizes of achromatic telescopes
for astronomical purposes, which are regularly sold by the London
opticians, are the following:--

1. _The 2-1/2 feet Achromatic._--This telescope has an object glass 30
inches in focal length, and 2 inches clear aperture. It is generally
furnished with two eye pieces, one for terrestrial objects, magnifying
about 30 or 35 times, and one for celestial objects with a power of 70
or 75 times. It might be furnished with an additional astronomical
eye-piece--if the object glass be a good one, so as to produce a power
of 90 or 95 times. With such a telescope, the belts and satellites of
Jupiter, the phases of Venus and the ring of Saturn may be perceived;
but not to so much advantage as with larger telescopes. It is generally
fitted up either with a mahogany or a brass tube, and is placed upon a
tripod brass stand, with a universal joint which produces a horizontal
and vertical motion. It is packed, along with the eye-pieces, and
whatever else belongs to it, in a neat mahogany box. Its price varies,
according as it is furnished with an elevating rack or other apparatus.

The following are the prices of this instrument as marked in the
catalogue of Mr. Tulley, Terrett’s Court, Islington, London.

                                                                £  s. d.
  2-1/2 feet telescopes, brass mounted on plain pillar and claw
  stand, with one eye piece for astronomical purposes, and
  one for land objects, to vary the magnifying power,

  Ditto, ditto, brass mounted on pillar and claw stand, with

The following prices of the same kind of telescope are from the
catalogue of Messrs. W. and, S. Jones, 30, Lower Holborn, London.

                                                                £  s. d.
  The improved 2-1/2 feet achromatic refractor, on a brass
  stand, mahogany tube, with three eye pieces, two magnifying
  about 40 and 50 times for terrestrial objects, and the
  other about 75 times for astronomical purposes, in a
  mahogany case                                                  10 10 0

  Ditto, ditto, the tube all brass, with three eye pieces        11 11 0

  motions                                                        15 15 0

2. _The 3-1/2 feet Achromatic Telescope._--The object glass of this
telescope is from 44 to 46 inches focal length, and 2-3/4 inches
diameter. It is generally furnished with four eye-pieces, two for
terrestrial and two for celestial objects. The lowest power for land
objects is generally about 45, which affords a large field of view, and
exhibits the objects with great brilliance. The other terrestrial power
is usually from 65 to 70. The astronomical powers are about 80 and 130;
but such a telescope should always have another eye-piece, to produce
a power of 180 or 200 times, which it will bear with distinctness,
in a serene state of the atmosphere, if the object glass be truly
achromatic. The _illuminating power_ in this telescope is nearly double
that of the 2-1/2 feet telescope, or in the proportion of 7, 56 to
4; and therefore it will bear about double the magnifying power with
nearly equal distinctness. This telescope is fitted up in a manner
somewhat similar to the former, with a tripod stand which is placed
upon a table. Sometimes, however, it is mounted on a long mahogany
stand which rests upon the floor, (as in fig. 58.), and is fitted with
an equatorial motion; and has generally a small telescope fixed near
the eye end of the large tube, called a _finder_, which serves to
direct the telescope to a particular object in the heavens when the
higher powers are applied. It is likewise eligible that it should have
an elevating rack and sliding tubes, for supporting the eye end of the
instrument, to keep it steady during astronomical observations, and it
would be an advantage, for various purposes which shall be afterwards
described, to have fitted to it a _Diagonal Eye Piece_ magnifying 40
times or upwards.

The prices of this instrument, as marked in Mr. Tulley’s Catalogue, are
as follows:--

                                                                £  s. d.

  Ditto, ditto, with elevating rack and achromatic finder,

The following are the prices as marked in Messrs. W. and S. Jones’
Catalogue.

                                                                £   s.  d.

  Ditto, ditto, brass tube                                       21   0  0

  Ditto, all in brass, with rack work motions, &c.               26   5  0

  Ditto, the object glass of the largest aperture, and the
  rack motions on an improved principle      _from_ 37l. 16s. to 42   0  0

  Ditto, fitted up with Equatorial motion, framed mahogany
  stand, divided altitude, and azimuth arches, or declination
  and right ascension circles, &c. &c.             _from_ 60l to 80   0  0

This is the telescope which I would particularly recommend to
astronomical amateurs, whose pecuniary resources do not permit them
to purchase more expensive instruments. When fitted up with the eye
pieces and powers already mentioned, and with a finder and elevating
rack,--price 25 guineas--it will serve all the purposes of general
observation. By this telescope, satisfactory views may be obtained of
most of the interesting phenomena of the heavens, such as the spots of
the sun--the mountains, vales, and caverns on the lunar surface--the
phases of Mercury and Venus--the spots on Mars--the satellites and
belts of Jupiter--the ring of Saturn--many of the more interesting
nebulæ, and most of the double stars of the second and third classes.
When the object glass of this telescope is accurately figured and
perfectly achromatic, a power of from 200 to 230 maybe put upon it, by
which the division of Saturn’s ring might occasionally be perceived. It
is more easily managed and represents objects considerably brighter
than reflecting telescopes of the same price and magnifying power,
and it is not so apt to be deranged as reflectors generally are. A
telescope of a less size would not in general be found satisfactory for
viewing the objects I have now specified, and for general astronomical
purposes. It may not be improper for the information of some readers,
to explain what is meant in Mr. Tulley’s catalogue, when it is stated
that this instrument has ‘one eye piece for day objects, _to vary the
magnifying power_.’ The eye piece alluded to is so constructed, that
by drawing out a tube next the eye, you may increase the power at
pleasure, and make it to vary, say from 40 to 80 or 100 times; so that
such a construction of the terrestrial eye piece (to be afterwards
explained) serves in a great measure, the purpose of separate
eye-pieces. The whole length of the 3-1/2 feet telescope, when the
terrestrial eye piece is applied, is about 4-1/2 feet from the object
glass to the first eye glass.

When the aperture of the object glass of this telescope exceeds 2-3/4
inches its price rapidly advances.

The following is Mr. Tulley’s scale of prices, proportionate to the
increase of aperture:--

                                                                  £  s. d.
  3-1/2 feet telescopes 3-1/4 inches aperture, with vertical and
  horizontal rack work motions, achromatic finder, 3 eye
  pieces for astronomical purposes, and one for day objects
  to vary the magnifying power, packed in a mahogany box         42  0  0

  Ditto, ditto, 3-3/4 inches diameter, mounted as above          68  5  0

  Ditto, with universal Equatorial, instead of pillar and
  claw stand                                                     84  0  0

Here, in the one case, the increase of half an inch in the diameter
of the object-glass, adds about £16. to the expense; and in the
other case no less than £26. 5s. The proportion of light in those
two telescopes, compared with that of 2-3/4 inches aperture, is as
follows:--The square of the 2-3/4 object-glass is 7.56; that of 3-1/4,
10.56, and that of the 3-3/4, 14.06; so that the light admitted by
the 3-1/4 compared with the 2-3/4 aperture, is nearly as 10 to 7; and
the light admitted by the 3-3/4 object-glass is nearly double that of
the 2-3/4 aperture, and will bear nearly a proportional increase of
magnifying power.

3. _The 5 feet Achromatic telescope._ The focal length of the
object-glass of this telescope is 5 feet 3 inches, and the diameter
of its aperture 3-8/10 inches. The usual magnifying powers applied
to it are, for land objects 65 times; and for celestial objects,
110, 190, 250, and sometimes one or two higher powers. The quantity
of light it possesses is not much larger than that of the 3-1/2 feet
telescope, with 3-3/4 inches aperture; but the larger focal length of
this telescope is considered to be an advantage; since the longer the
focus of the object-glass, the less will be its chromatic and spherical
aberrations, and the larger may be the eye-glasses, and the flatter the
field of view.

The following are the prices of these telescopes as marked in Mr.
Tulley’s catalogue.

                                                               £   s. d.
  5 feet telescopes 3-3/4 inches aperture, on an universal
  equatorial stand, with achromatic finder, 4 eye pieces for
  astronomical purposes, and 1 for day objects to vary the
  power, packed in a mahogany box               100 guineas to 157 10  0

  7 feet ditto, 5 inches aperture, on a newly improved
  universal equatorial stand, 6 eye pieces for astronomical
  purposes, and 1 for day objects to vary the magnifying
  power, with achromatic finder, and Troughton’s Micrometer     207 5  0

The above are all the kinds of achromatic telescopes _generally_
made by the London opticians. Those of the larger kind, as 5 and 7
feet telescopes, and the 3-1/2 feet with 3-3/4 inches aperture,
are generally made to order, and are not always to be procured. But
the 2-1/2 and 3-1/2 feet achromatics of 2-3/4 inches aperture, are
generally to be found ready-made at most of the optician’s shops in the
metropolis. The prices of these instruments are nearly the same in most
of the optician’s shops in London. Some of them demand a higher price,
but few of them are ever sold lower than what has been stated above,
unless in certain cases, where a discount is allowed.

[Illustration: _figure 57._]

The stands for these telescopes, and the manner in which they are
fitted up for observation are represented in figures 57, 58, and 59.
Fig. 57 represents either the 2-1/2 or the 3-1/2 feet telescopes
mounted on a plain brass stand, to be placed on a table. A is the long
eye-piece for land objects, and B the small eye-piece for astronomical
observation, which is composed of two lenses, and represents the object
in an inverted position. These eye-pieces are screwed on, as occasion
requires, at E, the eye-end of the telescope. The shorter of the two
astronomical eye-tubes which accompany this telescope, produces the
highest magnifying power. For adjusting the telescope to distinct
vision, there is a brass knob or button at _a_, which moves a piece of
rack-work connected with the eye-tube, which must be turned either one
way or the other till the object appears distinctly; and different eyes
frequently require a different adjustment.

Fig. 58, represents a 5 feet telescope fitted up for astronomical
observations. It is mounted on a mahogany stand, the three legs of
which are made to close up together by means of the brass frame _aaa_,
which is composed of three bars, connected with three joints in the
centre, and three other joints, connected with the three mahogany bars.
It is furnished with an apparatus for equatorial motions. The brass pin
is made to move round in the brass socket _b_, and may be tightened by
means of the finger screw _d_, when the telescope is directed nearly to
the object intended to be viewed. This socket may be set perpendicular
to the horizon, or to any other required angle; and the quantity of
the angle is ascertained by the divided arc, and the instrument made
fast in that position by the screw _e_. If this socket be set to the
latitude of the place of observation, and the plane of this arc be
turned so as to be in the plane of the meridian, the socket _b_ being
fixed to the inclination of the pole of the earth, the telescope
when turned in this socket, will have an equatorial motion, so that
celestial objects may be always kept in view, when this equatorial
motion is performed. The two handles at _k_ are connected with
rack-work, intended to move the telescope in any required direction.
The two sets of brass sliding rods _ii_ are intended to render the
telescope as steady as possible, and to elevate and depress it at
pleasure, and are so constructed as to slide into each other with the
utmost ease.

[Illustration: _figure 58._]

The _Finder_ is placed at AE, either on the top or the left side of
the tube of the telescope. When high magnifying powers are applied to
any telescope, it is sometimes difficult, on account of the smallness
of the field of view, to direct the main tube of the telescope to the
object. But the Finder, which is a telescope with a small power, and
consequently has a large field of view--when directed to any object, it
is easily found, and being brought to the centre of the field, where
two cross hairs intersect each other, it will then be seen in the
larger telescope. B is the eye-tube for terrestrial objects, containing
4 glasses, and C, one of the astronomical eye-pieces. A socket is
represented at _g_, containing a stained glass, which is screwed to any
of the eye-pieces, to protect the eye from the glare of light, when
viewing the spots of the sun. The brass nut above _f_, is intended for
the adjustment of the eye-piece to distinct vision. The 3-1/2 feet
telescope is sometimes mounted in this form.

Fig. 59, represents a 5 or 6 feet telescope, mounted on a stand of a
new construction by Dollond. It possesses the advantage of supporting
the telescope in two places, which renders it extremely steady--a
property of great importance when viewing celestial objects with high
magnifying powers. It possesses likewise, the advantage of enabling the
observer to continue seated at the same height from the floor, although
the telescope be raised to any altitude--_the elevation being entirely
at the object end_, although it may be changed from the horizon to
the zenith. The frame-work is composed of bars of mahogany, and rests
on three castors, two of which are made fast to their respective legs
in the usual way, and the third stands under the middle of the lower
horizontal bar that connects the two opposite legs, so that the frame
has all the advantages of a tripod. As it becomes very inconvenient to
stoop to the eye end of a telescope, when the altitude of an object is
considerable, and the centre of motion at the middle of the tube, this
construction of a stand serves to remedy such inconvenience.

_Proportions of curvature of the lenses which form an achromatic
object-glass._

As some ingenious mechanics may feel a desire to attempt the
construction of a compound achromatic object-glass, I shall here state
some of the proportions of curvature of the concave and convex lenses,
which serve to guide opticians in their construction of achromatic
instruments. These proportions are various; and even when demonstrated
to be mathematically correct, it is sometimes difficult to reduce them
to practice, on account of the different powers of refraction and
dispersion possessed by different discs of crown and flint-glass, and
of the difficulty of producing by mechanical means, the exact curves
which theory requires. The following table shows the radii of curvature
of the different surfaces of the lenses necessary to form _a double
achromatic object-glass_--it being supposed that the sine of refraction
in the crown-glass is as 1.528 to 1, and in the flint as 1.5735 to 1;
the ratio of their dispersive powers being as 1 to 1.524. It is also
assumed that the curvatures of the concave lens are as 1 to 2, that
is, that the one side of this lens is ground on a tool, the radius
of which is double that of the other. The 1st column expresses the
compound focus of the object-glass in _inches_; the 2nd column states
the radius of the _anterior_ surface of the _crown_, and column 3rd,
its _posterior_ side. Column 4th expresses the radius of the anterior
surface of the _concave_ lens, and column 5th its posterior surface,
which, it will be observed, is exactly double that of the other.

   120   | 30        | 46.   520 | 41.   712 | 83.   424

From the above table it will be seen, that to construct, for example,
a 30 inch compound object-glass, the radius of the anterior side of
the crown must be 7-1/2 inches, and that of the posterior side 11.63
inches; the radius of the anterior surface of the concave 10.428, and
that of the posterior 20.856 inches. It may be proper to observe,
that in these computations, the radius of the anterior surface of the
concave is less than the posterior side of the convex, and consequently
admits of its approach, without touching in the centre--a circumstance
which always requires to be guarded against in the combination of
achromatic glasses. The following table shows the radii of curvature of
the lenses of a _triple_ object-glass, calculated from formula deduced
by Dr. Robison of Edinburgh.

From this table it appears, that the two convex lenses, have the same
radii of their respective sides and that the concave flint lens has
its two surfaces equally concave, so that a triple object-glass formed
according to these proportions, would require only three pair of
grinding tools. The following are the curves of the lenses of one of
the best of Dollond’s achromatic telescopes, the focal length of the
compound object-glass being 46 inches. Reckoning from the surface next
the object--the radii of the crown-glass were 28 and 40 inches: the
concave lens 20.9 inches, and the inner crown-glass lens, 28.4 and 28.4
inches. This telescope carried magnifying powers of from 100 to 200
times.

Although I have inserted the above tables, which might in some measure
guide an ingenious artist, yet on the whole, a private amateur has
little chance in succeeding in such attempts. The diversity of glasses,
and the uncertainty of an unpractised workman’s producing the precise
curvatures he intends, is so great, that the object-glass, for the
most part, turns out different from his expectations. The great
difficulty in the construction is to find the exact proportion of the
dispersive powers of the crown and flint glass. The crown is pretty
constant, but there are hardly two pots of flint glass which have the
same dispersive power. Even if constant, it is difficult to measure
it accurately; and an error in this greatly affects the instrument;
because the focal distances of the lenses must be nearly as their
dispersive powers. In the two preceding tables, the sine of incidence,
in the crown glass, is supposed to be to the sine of refraction as
1.526 to 1; and in the flint glass, as 1.604 to 1. Opticians who make
great numbers of lenses both of flint and crown glass, acquire, in
time, a pretty good guess of the nature of the errors which may remain
after they have finished an object-glass; and having many lenses
intended to be of the same form, but unavoidably differing a little
from it, they try several of the concaves with the two convexes, and
finding one better than the rest, they make use of it to complete the
set. In this way some of the best achromatic telescopes are frequently
formed. I have sometimes found, when supplying a concave flint glass
to a telescope where it happened to be wanting, that, of four or five
concave lenses which appeared to be the same as to curvature and other
properties, only one was found to produce a distinct and colourless
image. Should any one, however, wish to attempt the construction of
an achromatic lens, the best way for preventing disappointments in
the result is, to procure a _variety_ of tables of the respective
curvatures founded on _different conditions_, and which, of course,
require the surfaces of the several lenses to be of different curves.
Having lenses of different radii at his command, and having glass of
different refractive or dispersive powers, when one combination does
not exactly suit, he may try another, and ultimately may succeed in
constructing a good achromatic telescope; for, in many cases, it has
been found that chance, or a happy combination of lenses by trial, has
led to the formation of an excellent object-glass.


_Achromatic telescopes composed of fluid lenses._

The best achromatic telescopes, when minutely examined, are found to be
in some respects defective, on account of that slight degree of colour
which, by the aberration of the rays, they give to objects, unless
the object-glass be of small diameter. When we examine with attention
a good achromatic telescope we find that it does not show white or
luminous objects perfectly free from colour, their edges being tinged
on one side with a claret-coloured fringe, and on the other with a
green fringe. This telescope, therefore, required farther improvement,
to get rid of these secondary colours, and Father Boscovich, to whom
every branch of optics is much indebted, displayed much ingenuity in
his attempts to attain this object. But it is to Dr. Blair, professor
of astronomy in Edinburgh, that we are chiefly indebted for the first
successful experiments by which this end was accomplished. By a
judicious set of experiments, he proved that the quality of dispersing
the rays in a greater degree than crown-glass, is not confined to a few
mediums; but is possessed by a great variety of fluids, and by some of
these in a most extraordinary degree. Having observed that when the
extreme red and violet rays were perfectly united, the green were left
out, he conceived the idea of making an achromatic concave lens which
should refract the green less than the united red and violet, and an
achromatic convex lens which should do the same, and as the concave
lens refracted the outstanding green _to_ the axis, while the concave
one refracted them _from_ the axis, it followed, that, by a combination
of these two opposite effects, the green would be united with the red
and violet.

By means of an ingenious prismatic apparatus, he examined the optical
properties of a great variety of fluids. The solutions of metals and
semi-metals proved in all cases more dispersive than crown glass. Some
of the salts, such as sal-ammoniac, greatly increased the dispersive
power of water. The marine acid disperses very considerably, and this
quality increases with its strength. The most dispersive fluids were
accordingly found to be those in which this acid and the metals were
combined. The chemical preparation called _causticum antimoniale_, or
butter of antimony, in its most concentrated state, when it has just
attracted sufficient humidity to render it fluid, possesses the quality
of dispersing the rays in an astonishing degree. The great quantity
of the semi-metal retained in solution, and the highly concentrated
state of the marine acid, are considered as the cause of this striking
effect. Corrosive sublimate of mercury, added to a solution of
_sal-ammoniacum_ in water, possesses the next place to the butter of
antimony among the dispersive fluids, which Dr. Blair examined. The
essential oils were found to hold the next rank to metallic solutions,
among fluids which possess the dispersive quality, particularly those
obtained from bituminous minerals, as native petrolea, pit coal, and
amber. The dispersive power of the essential oil of sassafras, and
the essential oil of lemons, when genuine, were found to be not much
inferior to any of these. But of all the fluids fitted for optical
purposes, Dr. Blair found that _the muriatic acid mixed with a metallic
solution_, or, in other words, a fluid in which the marine acid and
metalline particles, hold a due proportion, most accurately suited his
purpose. In a spectrum formed by this fluid the green were among the
most refrangible rays, and when its dispersion was corrected by that
of glass, there was produced an inverted secondary spectrum, that is,
one in which the green was above, when it would have been below with a
common medium. He therefore placed a concave lens of muriatic acid with
a metallic solution between the two lenses, as in fig. 60, where AB is
the concave fluid lens, CF a plano-convex lens, with its plane side
next the object, and ED, a meniscus. With this object-glass the rays of
different colours were bent from their rectilineal course with the same
equality and regularity as in reflection.

[Illustration: _figure 60._]

Telescopes constructed with such object-glasses were examined by the
late Dr. Robison and professor Playfair. The focal distance of the
object-glass of one of these did not exceed 17 inches, and yet it
bore an aperture of 3-1/2 inches. They viewed some single and double
stars and some common objects with this telescope; and found, that,
in magnifying power, brightness, and distinctness, it was manifestly
superior to one of Mr. Dollond of 42 inches focal length. They had
most distinct vision of a star, _when using an erecting eye-piece_,
which made this telescope magnify more than a 100 times; and they found
the field of vision as uniformly distinct as with Dollond’s 42 inch
telescope magnifying 46 times; and were led to admire the nice figuring
and centering of the very deep eye-glasses which were necessary for
this amplification. They saw double stars with a degree of perfection
which astonished them. These telescopes, however, have never yet come
into general use; and one reason perhaps, is, that they are much more
apt to be deranged, than telescopes constructed of object-glasses
which are solid. If any species of glass, or other solid transparent
substance could be found with the same optical properties, instruments
might perhaps be constructed of a larger size, and considerably
superior to our best achromatic telescopes.[23] It is said that Mr.
Blair, the son of Dr. Blair, some years ago, was engaged in prosecuting
his father’s views, but I have not heard any thing respecting the
result of his investigations.


_Barlow’s refracting telescope with a fluid concave lens._

Professor Barlow, not many years ago, suggested a new fluid telescope,
which is deserving of attention; and, about the year 1829 constructed
one of pretty large dimensions. The fluid he employs for this purpose
is the _sulphuret of Carbon_, which he found to be a substance which
possessed every requisite he could desire. Its index is nearly the
same as that of the best flint glass, with a dispersive power more
than double. It is perfectly colourless, beautifully transparent,
and although very expansible, possesses the same, or very nearly
the same optical properties under all circumstances to which it is
likely to be exposed in astronomical observations--except perhaps,
direct observations on the solar disc, which will probably be found
inadmissible. Mr. Barlow first constructed an object-glass with this
fluid of 3 inches aperture, with which he could see the small star in
Polaris with a power of 46, and with the higher powers several stars
which are considered to require a good telescope, for example 70, ρ
Ophinchi, 39 Bootis, the quadruple star ε Lyræ, ζ Aquarii, α Herculis,
&c. He next constructed a 6 inch object-glass. With this instrument
the small star in Polaris is so distinct and brilliant, with a power
of 143, that its transit might be taken with the utmost certainty. As
the mode of constructing these telescopes is somewhat novel, it may be
expedient to enter somewhat into detail.

In the usual construction of achromatic telescopes, the two or three
lenses composing the object-glass are brought into immediate contact;
and in the fluid telescope of Dr. Blair, the construction was the same,
the fluid having been enclosed in the object-glass itself. But in Mr.
Barlow’s telescope, the fluid correcting lens is placed at a distance
from the plate lens equal to half its focal length; and it might be
carried still farther back, and yet possess dispersive power to render
the object-glass achromatic. By this means the fluid lens--which is the
most difficult part of the construction--is reduced to one half or
to less than one half of the size of the plate lens; consequently, to
construct a telescope of 10 or 12 inches aperture involves no greater
difficulty in the manipulation, than in making a telescope of the usual
description of 5 or 6 inches aperture, except in the simple plate lens
itself; and, hence, a telescope of this kind, of 10 or 12 feet length,
will be equivalent in its focal power to one of 16 or 20 feet. By this
means, the tube may be shortened several feet and yet possess a focal
power more considerable than could be conveniently given to it on the
usual principle of construction. This will be better understood from
the annexed diagram. (fig. 61.)

[Illustration: _figure 61._]

In this figure ABCD represent the tube of the 6 inch telescope, CD, the
plate object-glass, F the first focus of rays, _de_ the fluid concave
lens, distant from the former 24 inches. The focal length MF being
48, and consequently, as 48 : 6 :: 24 : 3 inches, the diameter of the
fluid lens. The resulting compound focus is 62.5 inches. It is obvious,
therefore, that the rays _df_, _ef_, arrive at the focus under the same
convergency, and with the same light as if they proceeded from a lens
of 6 inches diameter, placed at a distance beyond the object-glass
CD (as GH,) determined by producing those rays till they meet the
sides of the tube in GH, namely at 62.5 inches beyond the fluid lens.
Hence, it is obvious, the rays will converge as they would do from an
object-glass GH of the usual kind with a focus of 10 feet 5 inches. We
have thus, therefore, shortened the tube 38.5 inches, or have at least
the advantage of a focus 38.5 inches longer than our tube; and the
same principle may be carried much farther, so as to reduce the usual
length of refracting telescopes nearly one half without increasing
the aberration in the first glass beyond the least that can possibly
belong to a telescope of the usual kind of the whole length. It should
likewise be observed that the adjustment for focus may be made either
in the usual way, or by a slight movement of the fluid lens, as in the
Gregorian Reflectors, by means of the small speculum.

Mr. Barlow afterwards constructed another and a larger telescope on the
same principle, the clear aperture of which is 7.8 inches. Its tube is
11 feet, which, together with the eye-piece, makes the whole length
12 feet, but its effective focus is on the principle stated above, 18
feet. It carries a power of 700 on the closest double stars in South’s
and Herschel’s catalogue, and the stars are, with that power, round
and defined, although the field is not then so bright as could be
desired. The telescope is mounted on a revolving stand, which works
with considerable accuracy as an azimuth and altitude instrument. To
give steadiness to the stand it has been made substantial and heavy;
its weight by estimation being 400 pounds, and that of the telescope
130 pounds, yet its motions are so smooth, and the power so arranged,
that it may be managed by one person with the greatest ease, the star
being followed by a slight touch, scarcely exceeding that of the keys
of a piano-forte. The focal length of the plate lens is 78 inches,
and of the fluid lens 59.8 inches--which at the distance of 40 inches
produce a focal length of 104 inches, a total length of 12 feet, and
an equivalent focus of 18 feet. The curves of the parallel meniscus
checks for containing the fluid are--30 inches, and 144 inches, the
latter towards the eye. The curves for the plate lens are 56.4 and
144. There is an interior tube 5 inches diameter, and 3 feet 6 inches
long, which carries the cell in which the fluid is enclosed, and an
apparatus by which it may be moved backwards and forwards, so that
the proper adjustment may be made for colour, in the first instance,
and afterwards the focus is obtained by the usual rack-work motion.
The following is the mode by which the fluid was enclosed. After the
best position has been determined practically for the checks forming
the fluid lens, these, with the ring between them ground and polished
accurately to the same curves, are applied together, and taken into
an artificial high temperature, exceeding the greatest at which the
telescope is ever expected to be used. After remaining here with the
fluid some time, the space between the glasses is completely filled,
immediately closed, cooled down by evaporation, and removed into a
lower temperature. By this means a sudden condensation takes place, an
external pressure is brought on the checks, and a bubble formed inside,
which is of course filled with the vapour of the fluid; the excess of
the atmospheric pressure beyond that of the vapour being afterwards
always acting externally to prevent contact. The extreme edges are then
sealed with the serum of human blood, or by strong fish-glue, and some
thin pliable metal surface. By this process, Mr. Barlow says, ‘I have
every reason to believe the lens becomes as durable as any lens of
solid glass. At all events I have the satisfaction of stating, that my
first 3 inch telescope has now been completed more than fifteen months,
and that no change whatever has taken place in its performance, nor the
least perceptible alteration either in the quantity or the quality of
the fluid.’

The following are some of the observations which have been made with
this telescope, and the tests to which it has been subjected. The very
small star which accompanies the pole-star is generally one of the
first tests applied to telescopes. This small point of light appeared
brilliant and distinct; it was best seen with a power of 120, but was
visible with a power of 700. The small star in Aldebaran was very
distinct with a power of 120. The small star α Lyræ was distinctly
visible with the same power. The small star called by Sir J. Herschel
_Debilissima_, between 4 ε and 5 Lyræ, whose existence, he says, could
not be suspected in either the 5 or 7 feet equatorial, and invisible
also with the 7 and 10 feet reflectors of six and 9 inches aperture,
but seen double with the 20 feet reflector, is seen very satisfactorily
double with this telescope. η Persei, marked as double in South and
Herschel’s catalogue, at the distance of 28´´, with another small star
at the distance of 3´ 67´´, is seen distinctly sixfold, four of the
small stars being within a considerably less distance than the remote
one of η marked in the catalogue. And, rejecting the remote star, the
principal, and the four other stars, form a miniature representation
of Jupiter and his satellites, three of them being nearly in a line
on one side, and the other on the opposite. _Castor_, is distinctly
double with 120, and well opened and stars perfectly round with 360
and 700: γ Leonis and α Piscium are seen with the same powers equally
round and distinct. In ε Bootis, the small star is well separated
from the larger, and its blue colour well marked with a power of 360.
η Coronæ Borealis is seen double with a power of 360 and 700. 52
Orionis, ζ Orionis, and others of the same class are also well defined
with the same powers. In regard to the planets which happened to be
visible--Venus appeared beautifully white and well defined with a power
of 120, but showed some colour with 360. Saturn with the 120 power,
is a very brilliant object, the double ring and belts being well and
satisfactorily defined, and with the 360 power, it is still very fine.
The moon also is remarkably beautiful, the edges and the shadows being
well marked, while the quantity of light is such as to bring to view
every minute distinction of figure and shade.

The principal objections that may be made to this construction of a
telescope are such as these:--Can the fluid be permanently secured?
Will it preserve its transparency and other optical properties? Will
it not act upon the surface of the glass and partially destroy it? &c.
To such enquiries Mr. Barlow replies, that experience is the only test
we have; our spirit levels, spirit thermometers, &c., show that some
fluids at least may be preserved for many years, without experiencing
any change, and without producing any in the appearance of the glass
tubes containing them. But should any of these happen, except the last,
nothing can be more simple than to supply the means of replacing the
fluid at any time, and by any person, without disturbing the adjustment
of the telescope. He expresses his hope that, should these experiments
be prosecuted, an achromatic telescope may ultimately be produced
which shall exceed in aperture and power, any instruments of the kind
hitherto attempted. If the prejudice against the use of fluids could be
removed, he feels convinced that well-directed practice would soon lead
to the construction of the most perfect instruments, on this principle,
at a comparatively small expense. ‘I am convinced,’ he says, ‘judging
from what has been paid for large object-glasses, that my telescope,
telescope stand, and the building for observation, with every other
requisite convenience, have been constructed for a less sum than would
be demanded for the object-glass only, if one could be produced of the
same diameter of plate and flint-glass; and this is a consideration
which should have some weight, and encourage a perseverance in the
principle of construction.’[24]


ROGERS’ ACHROMATIC TELESCOPE ON A NEW PLAN.

The object of this construction is to render a small disc of
flint-glass available to perform the office of compensation to a much
larger one of crown-glass, and thus to render possible the construction
of telescopes of much larger aperture than are now common, without
hindrance from the difficulty at present experienced in procuring large
discs of flint-glass. It is well known to those who are acquainted
with telescopes, that in the construction of an ordinary achromatic
object-glass, in which a single crown lens is compensated by a single
one of flint, the two lenses admit of being separated only by an
interval too small to afford any material advantage, _in diminishing
the diameter of the flint lens_, by placing it in a narrower part
of the cone of rays--the actual amount of their difference in point
of dispersive power being such as to render the correction of the
chromatic aberration impossible, when their mutual distance exceeds
a certain limit. This inconvenience Mr. Rogers proposes to obviate,
by employing, as a correcting lens--not a single lens of flint, but a
compound one consisting of a convex crown and concave flint, whose foci
are such as to cause their combination to act as a plain glass on the
mean refrangible rays. Then it is evident, that by means of the greater
dispersive power of flint than of crown glass, this will act as a
concave on the violet, and as a convex on the red rays, and _that_ the
more powerfully, according as the lenses separately have greater powers
or curvature. If then, such a compound lens be interposed between the
object-glass of a telescope--supposed to be a single lens of plate or
crown-glass--and its focus, it will cause no alteration in the focus
for mean rays, while it will lengthen the focus for violet, and shorten
it for red rays. Now this is precisely what is wanted to produce an
achromatic union of all the rays in the focus; and as nothing in this
construction limits the powers of the individual correcting lenses,
they may therefore be applied any where that convenience may dictate;
and thus, theoretically speaking, a disc of flint-glass, however small,
may be made to correct the colour of one of crown however large.

This construction, likewise, possesses other and very remarkable
advantages. For, first, when the correcting lens is approximately
constructed on a calculation founded on its intended aperture, and on
the refractive and dispersive indices of its materials, the final and
complete dispersion of colour may be effected, not by altering the
lenses by grinding them anew, but by shifting the combination nearer
to, or farther from, the object-glass, as occasion may require, along
the tube of a telescope, by a screw motion, till the condition of
achromaticity is satisfied in the best manner possible. And secondly,
the spherical aberration may in like manner be finally corrected, by
slightly separating the lenses of the correcting glass, whose surfaces
should for this purpose be figured to curvatures previously determined
by calculation, to admit of this mode of correction--a condition which
Mr. Rogers finds to be always possible. The following is the rule
he lays down for the determination of the foci of the lenses of the
correcting glass:--‘The focal length of either lens of the correcting
lens is to that of the object-glass, in a ratio compounded of the ratio
of the square of the aperture of the correcting lens to that of the
object-glass, and of the ratio of the difference of the dispersive
indices of the crown and flint glass, to the dispersive index of
crown.’ For example, to correct the colour of a lens of crown or plate
glass of 9 inches aperture, and 14 feet focal length (the dimensions
of the telescope of Fraunhofer at Dorpat) by a disc of flint glass 3
inches in diameter, the focus of either lens of the correcting lens
will require to be about 9 inches. To correct it by a 4 inch disc will
require a focus of about 16 inches each.

Mr. Rogers remarks, that it is not indispensable to make the
correcting glass act as a plane lens. It is sufficient if it be so
adjusted as to have a shorter focus for red rays than for violet.
If, preserving this condition, it be made to act as a concave lens,
the advantage procured by Mr. Barlow’s construction of reducing the
length of the telescope with the same focal power, is secured, and he
considers, moreover, that by a proper adaptation of the distances,
foci, &c., of the lenses, we might hope to combine with all these
advantages that of the destruction of the secondary spectrum, and thus
obtain a perfect telescope.

The above is an abstract of a paper read to the ‘Astronomical Society
of London’ in April 1828, by A. Rogers, Esq.

The reader will easily perceive that the principle on which Mr.
Rogers proposes to construct his telescope is very nearly similar
to that of professor Barlow, described above, with this difference,
that the correcting lens of the Professor’s telescope is composed of
a transparent _fluid_, while that of Mr. Rogers is a _solid_ lens
consisting of a convex crown and concave flint. The general object
intended to be accomplished by both is the same, namely, to make a
correcting lens of a comparatively small diameter serve the purpose of
a large disc of flint glass, which has hitherto been very expensive,
and very difficult to be procured; and likewise to reduce the length of
the telescope while the advantage of a long focal power is secured.--A
telescope, on this principle, was constructed 7 or 8 years ago by
Mr. Wilson, lecturer on Philosophy and Chemistry, Glasgow, before he
was aware that Mr. Rogers had proposed a similar plan. I have had an
opportunity of particularly inspecting Mr. Wilson’s telescope, and
trying its effects on terrestrial objects with high powers, and was on
the whole highly pleased with its performance. It appeared to be almost
perfectly achromatic, and produced a distinct and _well-defined_ image
of minute distant objects, such as small letters on sign-posts, at 2,
3 and 4 miles distant. But I had no opportunity of trying its effects
on double stars or any other celestial objects. The instrument is above
6 feet long; the object lens is a plano-convex of crown glass 4 feet
focal distance, and 4 inches diameter, the plain side next the object.

At 26 inches distant from the object lens is the compound lens of 2
inches in diameter; and the two lenses of which it is composed are
both ground to a radius of 3-3/4 inches. That made of crown glass is
_plano-convex_, the other, made of flint glass, is plano-concave, and
are placed close together, the convex side being next the object, and
the concave side next the eye. The greater refractive power of the
flint glass renders the compound one slightly concave in its effect
(although the radius of curvature is similar in both), and lengthens
the focus to 6 feet from the object-glass; and this is consequently the
length of the instrument. The compound corrector so placed intercepts
all those rays which go to form the image in the field of view,
producing there an achromatic image. The concave power of the corrector
renders the image larger than if directly produced by a convex lens
of the same focus. The concavity of the corrector is valuable also in
this respect, that a very slight alteration in its distance from the
object-glass, changes the focal distance much more than if it were
plain, and enables us to adjust the instrument to perfect achromatism
with great precision.




CHAPTER V.


ON REFLECTING TELESCOPES.

SECT. 1.--HISTORY OF THE INVENTION, AND A GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF THE
CONSTRUCTION OF THESE INSTRUMENTS.

Reflecting telescopes are those which represent the images of distant
objects by reflection, chiefly from concave mirrors.

Before the achromatic telescope was invented, there were two glaring
imperfections in refracting telescopes, which the astronomers of
the 17th century were anxious to correct. The first was its very
great length when a high power was to be applied, which rendered it
very unwieldy and difficult to use. The second imperfection was the
incorrectness of the image as formed by a single lens. Mathematicians
had demonstrated that a pencil of rays could not be collected in a
single point by a spherical lens, and also that the image transmitted
by such a lens would be in some degree incurvated. After several
attempts had been made to correct this imperfection by grinding lenses
to the figure of one of the conic sections, Sir I. Newton happened to
commence an examination of the colours formed by a prism; and having,
by the means of this simple instrument, discovered the different
refrangibility of the rays of light--to which we have several times
adverted in the preceding descriptions--he then perceived that the
errors of telescopes, arising from that cause alone, were some hundred
times greater than such as were occasioned by the spherical figure
of lenses; which induced this illustrious philosopher to turn his
attention to the improvement of telescopes by reflection.

It is generally supposed that Mr. James Gregory--a son of the Rev. John
Gregory, minister of Drumoak in the county of Aberdeen--was the first
who suggested the construction of a reflecting telescope. He was a
young man of uncommon genius, and an eminent mathematician; and in the
year 1663, at the age of only 24, he published in London, his treatise
entitled ‘Optica Promota,’ in which he explained the theory of that
species of reflecting telescope which still bears his name, and which
he stated as being his own invention. But as Gregory, according to his
own account, was endowed with no mechanical dexterity, and could find
no workman capable of realizing his invention--after some fruitless
attempts to form proper specula, he was obliged to give up the pursuit;
so that this telescope remained for a considerable time neglected.
It was several years after Gregory suggested the construction of
reflecting telescopes, till Newton directed his attention fully to the
subject. In a letter addressed to the secretary of the Royal Society,
dated in February, 1672, he says, ‘Finding reflections to be regular,
so that the angle of reflection of all sorts of rays was equal to
the angle of incidence, I understood that, by their mediation, optic
instruments might be brought to any degree of perfection imaginable,
providing a reflecting substance could be found which would polish as
finely as glass, and reflect as much light as glass transmits, and the
art of communicating to it a parabolic figure be also obtained. Amidst
these thoughts I was forced from Cambridge by the intervening plague,
and it was more than two years before I proceeded further.’

It was towards the end of 1668, or in the beginning of the following
year, when Newton, being obliged to have recourse to reflectors, and
not relying on any artificer for making the specula, set about the work
himself, and early in the year 1672, completed two small reflecting
telescopes. In these he ground the great speculum into a spherical
concave, although he approved of the parabolic form, but found himself
unable to accomplish it. These telescopes were of a construction
somewhat different from what Gregory had suggested, and though only 6
inches long, were considered as equal to a 6 feet common refracting
telescope. It is not a little singular, however, that we hear no more
about the construction of reflectors till more than half a century
afterwards. It was not till the year 1723, that any reflectors were
known to have been made, adapted to celestial observations. In that
year, Mr. Hadley, the inventor of the reflecting quadrant, which goes
by his name, published in No. 376 of the Philosophical Transactions, an
account of a large reflector on Newton’s plan, which he had just then
constructed, the performance of which left no room to doubt that this
invention would remain any longer in obscurity. The large speculum of
this instrument was 62-5/8 inches focal distance and 5 inches diameter,
was furnished with magnifying powers of from 190 to 230 times, and
equalled in performance the famous aerial telescope of Huygens of 123
feet in length.[25] Since this period, the reflecting telescope has
been in general use among astronomers in most countries of Europe,
and has received numerous improvements, under the direction of Short,
Mudge, Edwards and Herschel--the last of whom constructed reflectors
of 7, 10, 20, and even 40 feet in focal length, which far surpassed,
in brightness and magnifying power, all the instruments of this
description, which had previously been attempted.

I shall now proceed to give a brief sketch of the nature of a
reflecting telescope, and the different forms in which they have been
proposed to be constructed.

Fig. 62 represents the reflecting telescope as originally proposed
by Gregory. ABEF represents a tube open at AF towards the object; at
the other end is placed a concave speculum BE, with a hole CD in its
centre, the focus of which is at _e_. A little beyond this focus,
towards the object end of the telescope AF, is placed another small
concave mirror G, having its polished face turned towards the great
speculum, and is supported by an arm GH fastened to a slider connected
with the tube. At the end of the great tube BE is screwed in a small
tube CDKI, containing a small plano-convex lens IK. Such are the
essential parts of this instrument and their relative positions. It
will be recollected in our description of the properties of concave
mirrors (see page 92), that, when rays proceed from a distant object,
and fall upon a concave-speculum, they paint an image or representation
of the object in its focus before the speculum. Now suppose two
parallel rays _ab_ falling on the speculum BE, in _cd_; they are
reflected to its focus _e_ where an inverted image of the object is
formed. This image is formed at a little more than the focal distance
of the small speculum from its surface, and serves as it were for an
object on which the small mirror may act. By the action of this mirror
this first image is reflected to a point about _f_, where a second
image is formed very large and erect. This image is magnified in the
proportion of _f_G to _e_G, the rays from which are transmitted to the
eye glass IK, through which the eye perceives the object clear and
distinct, after the proper adjustments have been made.

[Illustration: _fig. 62._]

[Illustration: _fig. 63._]

[Illustration: _fig. 64._]

[Illustration: _fig. 65._]

[Illustration: _figure 66._]

Suppose the focal distance of the great mirror was 9 inches, and the
focal distance of the small mirror 1-1/2 inch--were we to remove the
eye piece of this telescope, and look through the hole of the great
mirror, we should see the image of the object depicted upon the face of
the small speculum, and magnified, in the proportion of 9 to 1-1/2, or,
6 times, on the same principle as a common convex object glass 9 inches
focal length, with an eye glass whose focus is 1-1/2 inch magnifies 6
times. This may be regarded as the first part of the magnifying power.
If now, we suppose the small speculum placed a little more than 1-1/2
inch from the image formed by the great speculum, a second image is
formed about _f_, as much exceeding the first in its dimensions as it
exceeds it in distance from the small speculum, on the principle on
which the object glass of a compound microscope forms a large image
near the eye glass. Suppose this distance to be 9 times greater, then
the whole magnifying power will be compounded of 6 multiplied by 9, or
54 times. As a telescope it magnifies 6 times, and in the microscope
part 9 times.--Such is a _general_ idea of the Gregorian telescope, the
minute particulars and structure of which can only be clearly perceived
by a direct inspection of the instrument.

_The Newtonian Reflector._--This instrument is somewhat different
both in its form and in its mode of operation from that of Gregory.
It is represented in fig. 63, where BAEF is the tube, and BE, the
object concave mirror, which reflects the parallel rays _ab_ to a
_plane_ speculum G, placed 45°, or half a right angle to the axis of
the concave speculum. This small plane reflector must be of an oval
form, the length of the oval should be to the breadth as 7 to 5, on
account of the obliquity of its position. It is supported on an arm
fixed to the side of the tube; an eye-glass is placed in a small tube,
moveable in the larger tube, so as to be perpendicular to the axis of
the large reflector, the perpendicular line passing through the centre
of the small mirror. The small mirror is situated between the large
mirror and its focus, that its distance from this focal point may be
equal to the distance from the centre of the mirror to the focus of the
eye-glass. When the rays _ab_ from a distant object fall upon the large
speculum at _cd_, they are reflected towards a focus at _h_; but being
intercepted by the plane mirror G, they are reflected perpendicularly
to the eye-glass at I, in the side of the tube, and the image formed
near that position at _e_ is viewed through a small plano-convex lens.
The magnifying power of this telescope is in the proportion of the
focal distance of the speculum to that of the eye-glass. Thus, if the
focal distance of the speculum be 36 inches, and that of the eye-glass
1/3 of an inch, the magnifying power will be 108 times. It was this
form of the reflecting telescope, that Newton invented, which Sir. W.
Herschel adopted, and with which he made most of his observations and
discoveries.

_The Cassegrainian Reflector._--This mode of the reflecting telescope,
suggested by M. Cassegrain, a Frenchman, is represented in fig. 64. It
is constructed in the same way as the Gregorian, with the exception of
a small _convex_ speculum G being substituted in the room of the small
concave in Gregory’s construction. As the focus of a convex mirror is
negative, it is placed at a distance from the large speculum equal to
the difference of their foci, that is, if the focal length of the large
speculum be 18 inches, and that of the small convex 2 inches, they are
placed at 16 inches distant from each other, on a principle similar
to that of the Galilean telescope, in which the concave eye-glass is
placed within the focus of the object-glass by a space equal to the
focal length of the eye-glass. In this telescope, likewise, instead
of two there is only _one image_ formed, namely that in the focus
of the eye-glass; and, on this account some are of opinion that the
distinctness is considerably greater than in the Gregorian. Mr. Ramsden
was of opinion that this construction is preferable to either of the
former reflectors, because the aberrations of the two metals have a
tendency to correct each other, whereas in the Gregorian both the
metals being concave, any error in the specula will be doubled. It is
his opinion that the aberrations in the Cassegrainian construction
to that of the Gregorian is as 3 to 5. The length of this telescope
is shorter than that of a Gregorian of equal focal length, by twice
the focal length of the small mirror, and it shows every thing in
an _inverted_ position, and consequently is not adapted for viewing
terrestrial objects.

_Dr. Hook’s Reflector._--Before the reflecting telescope was much
known, Dr. Hook contrived one, the form of which is represented, fig.
65, which differs in little or nothing from the Gregorian, except that
the eye-glass I is placed in the hole of the great speculum BE.

_Martin’s Reflector._--Mr. Bengamin Martin, a distinguished writer on
optical and philosophical science, about a century ago, described a
new form of the reflecting telescope, approximating to the Newtonian
structure, which he contrived for his own use. It is represented in
fig. 66. ABEF is the tube, in which there is an opening or aperture OP,
in the upper part. Against this hole within the tube is placed a large
plane speculum GH, at half a right angle with the axis or sides of the
tubes, with a hole CD perforated through its middle. The parallel rays
_a b_ falling on the inclined plane GH are reflected perpendicularly
and parallel on the great speculum BE in the bottom of the tube. From
thence they are reflected converging to a focus _e_ through the hole of
the plane mirror CD, which being also the focus of the eye-glass IK,
the eye will perceive the object magnified and distinct.

In the figures referred to in the above descriptions, only one
eye-glass is represented to avoid complexity; but in most reflecting
telescopes, the eye-piece consists of a combination of two plano-convex
glasses, as in fig. 67, which produces a more correct and a larger
field of view than a single lens. This combination is generally known
by the name of the _Huygenian eye-piece_ which shall be described in
the section on the _eye-pieces_ of telescopes.

The following rule has been given for finding the magnifying power of
the Gregorian telescope:--Multiply the focal distance of the great
mirror by the distance of the small mirror from the image next the
eye; and multiply the focal distance of the small mirror by the focal
distance of the eye-glass; then divide the product of the former
multiplication by the product of the latter, and the quotient will
express the magnifying power. The following are the dimensions of one
of the reflecting telescopes constructed by Mr. Short--who was long
distinguished as the most eminent maker of such instruments, on a large
scale, and whose large reflectors are still to be found in various
observatories throughout Europe.

The focal distance of the great mirror 9.6 inches; or P _m_, fig. 67,
its breadth FD 2.3; the focal distance of the small mirror L _n_
1.5--or 1-1/2 inch--its breadth _g h_ 0.6--or 6/10 of an inch; the
breadth of the hole in the great mirror UV, 0.5--or half an inch--the
distance between the small mirror and the next eye-glass LR, 14.2; the
distance between the two eye-glasses SR, 2.4; the focal distance of the
eye-glass next the metal, 3.8.; and the focal distance of the eye-glass
next the eye, S _a_ 1.1, or one inch and one tenth. The magnifying
power of this telescope was about 60 times. Taking this telescope as a
standard, the following table of the dimensions and magnifying powers
of Gregorian reflecting telescopes, as constructed by Mr. Short, has
been computed.

Mr. Short--who was born in Edinburgh in 1710, and died near London,
1768--was considered as the most accurate constructor of reflecting
telescopes, during the period which intervened from 1732, to 1768. In
1743, he constructed a reflector for Lord Thomas Spencer, of 12 feet
focal length, for which he received 600 guineas. He made several other
telescopes of the same focal distance, with greater improvements and
higher magnifiers; and in 1752, finished one for the king of Spain, for
which, with its whole apparatus, he received £1200. This was considered
the noblest instrument of its kind that had then been constructed, and
perhaps it was never surpassed, till Herschel constructed his twenty
and forty feet reflectors. High as the prices of large telescopes now
are, Mr. Short charged for his instruments at a much higher rate than
opticians now do, although the price of labour, and every other article
required in the construction of a telescope, is now much dearer. But
he had then scarcely any competitor, and he spared neither trouble nor
expense to make his telescopes perfect, and put such a price upon them
as properly repaid him. The following table contains a statement of the
apertures, powers, and prices of Gregorian telescopes, as constructed
by Mr. James Short.[26]

From this table, it appears that Mr. Short charged 75 guineas for a 3
feet reflector, whereas such an instrument is now marked in the London
opticians’ catalogues at £23, when mounted on a common brass stand, and
£39. 18s., when accompanied with rack-work motions and other apparatus.
It is now generally understood that in the above table, Short always
greatly _overrated_ the higher powers of his telescopes. By experiment
they were generally found to magnify _much less_ than here expressed.

_General remarks on Gregorian Reflectors._--1. In regard to the hole
UV, of the great speculum--its diameter should be equal, or nearly
so, to that of the small speculum L, fig. 67. For if it be less, no
more parallel rays will be reflected than if it were equal to _g h_,
and it may do harm in contracting the visible area within too narrow
limits. Nor must it be larger than the mirror L, because some parallel
rays will then be lost, and those of most consequence as being nearest
the centre. 2. The small hole at _e_ to which the eye is applied,
must be nicely adjusted to the size of the cone of rays proceeding
from the nearest lens S. If it be larger, it will permit the foreign
light of the sky or other objects to enter the eye, so as to prevent
distinct vision; for the eye should receive no light, but what comes
from the surface of the small mirror L. If the hole be smaller than
the cylinder of rays at _e_ then some of the necessary light will be
excluded, and the object rendered more obscure. The diameter of this
hole may be found by dividing the aperture of the telescope in inches
by its magnifying power. Thus, if we divide the diameter of one of
Short’s telescopes, the diameter of whose large speculum is 2.30, by
60, the magnifying power, the quotient will be .0383, which is nearly
the 1/25 of an inch. Sometimes this hole is made so small as the 1/50
of an inch. When this hole is, by any derangement, shifted from its
proper position, it sometimes requires great nicety to adjust it, and,
before it is accurately adjusted, the telescope is unfit for accurate
observation. 3. It is usual to fix a plate with a hole in it, at _a b_,
the focus of the eye glass S, of such a diameter as will circumscribe
the image, so as to exhibit only that part of it which appears
distinct, and to exclude the superfluous rays. 4. There is an adjusting
screw on the outside of the great tube, connected with the small
speculum, by which that speculum may be pushed backwards or forwards to
adjust the instrument to distinct vision. The hand is applied for this
purpose at T.

_Newtonian Telescopes._--These telescopes are now more frequently
used for celestial observations than during the last century, when
Gregorian reflectors were generally preferred. Sir W. Herschel was
chiefly instrumental in introducing this form of the reflecting
telescope to the more particular attention of astronomers, by the
splendour and extent of the discoveries which it enabled him to make.
In this telescope there is no hole required in the middle of the great
speculum, as in the Gregorian construction, which circumstance secures
the use of all the rays which flow from the central parts of the mirror.

The following table contains a statement of the apertures and
magnifying powers of Newtonian Telescopes, and the focal distances of
their eye-glasses. The first column contains the focal length of the
great speculum in feet; the second, its linear aperture in inches;
the third, the focal distance of the single glass in decimals, or in
1000ths of an inch, and the fourth column, contains the magnifying
power. This portion of the table was constructed by using the
dimensions of Mr. Hadley’s Newtonian Telescope, formerly referred to,
as a standard--the focal distance of the great mirror being 62-1/2
inches, its medium aperture 5 inches, and power 208. The fifth, sixth,
and seventh columns contains the apertures of the concave speculum,
the focal lengths of the eye-glasses and the magnifying powers, as
calculated by Sir D. Brewster, from a telescope of Mr. Hauksbee, taken
as a standard; whose focal length was 3 feet 3 inches, its aperture
about 4 inches, and magnifying power 226 times.

  A: Focal distance  of concave metal.
  B: Aperture of concave metal.
  C: Focal distance of single eye-glass.
  D: Magnifying power.
  E: Aperture of the concave speculum.

One great advantage of reflecting telescopes above common refractors,
is, that they will admit of eye glasses of a much shorter focal
distance, and consequently, will magnify so much the more, for the
rays are not coloured by reflection from a concave mirror, if it be
ground to a true figure, as they are by passing through a convex
glass though figured and polished with the utmost exactness. It will
be perceived from the above table, that the focal length of the eye
glasses is very small, the lowest there stated being only about 1/10
of an inch, and the highest little more than 1/4 of an inch focal
distance. Sir W. Herschel obtained the high powers which he sometimes
put upon his telescopes, by using small double convex lenses for eye
glasses, some of which did not exceed the _one fiftieth of an inch_ in
focal length. When the focal length of the concave speculum, and that
of the eye glass are given, the magnifying power is found by dividing
the former by the latter, after having reduced the focal length of the
concave speculum to inches. Thus the 6 feet speculum, multiplied by 12,
produces 72 inches, which, divided by Brewster’s number for the focus
of the eye glass = 200, or 1/5 of an inch, produces a quotient of 360
as the magnifying power. It has been calculated that, if the metals
of a Newtonian telescope be worked as exquisitely as those in Sir W.
Herschel’s 7 feet reflector, the highest power that such a telescope
should bear with perfect distinctness, will be found by multiplying the
diameter of the great speculum in inches, by 74, and the focal distance
of the single eye glass may be found by dividing the focal distance of
the great mirror by the magnifying power. Thus 6.25--the aperture in
inches of Herschel’s 7 feet Newtonian--multiplied by 74 is 462-1/2, the
magnifying power; and 7 multiplied by 12, and divided by 462.5 is 0.182
of an inch, the focal distance of the single eye glass required. But
it is seldom that more than one half of this power can be applied with
effect to any of the planetary bodies. For general purposes the power
produced by multiplying the diameter of the speculum by 30, or 40, will
be found most satisfactory.

The following are the general prices of reflecting telescopes as made
by the London opticians.

_Comparative brightness of achromatic and reflecting telescopes._ The
late astronomer royal, Dr. Maskelyne, from a comparison of a variety of
telescopes, was led to the following conclusion,--‘that the aperture
of a common reflecting telescope, in order to show objects as bright
as the achromatic must be to that of an achromatic telescope as 8 to
5,’--in other words, an achromatic whose object glass is 5 inches
diameter, will show objects with as great a degree of brightness as a
reflector whose large speculum is 8 inches in diameter. This result,
if correct, must be owing to the small number of rays reflected from
a speculum compared with the number transmitted through an achromatic
object glass.


SECT. 2.--THE HERSCHELIAN TELESCOPE.

Soon after Sir William Herschel commenced his astronomical career, he
introduced a new era in the history of reflecting telescopes. After he
had cast and polished an immense variety of specula for telescopes of
different sizes-he, at length, in the year 1782, finished a 20 feet
reflector with a large aperture. Being sensible of the vast quantity
of light which is lost by a second reflection from the small speculum,
he determined to throw it aside altogether, and mounted this 20 feet
reflector on a stand that admitted of being used without a small
speculum in making _front observations_--that is, in sitting with his
back to the object, and looking directly towards the surface of the
speculum. Many of his discoveries and measurements of double stars were
made with this instrument, till, at length, in the year 1785 he put
the finishing hand to that gigantic speculum, which soon became the
object of universal astonishment, and which was intended for his _forty
feet_ reflecting telescope; he had succeeded so well in constructing
reflecting telescopes of comparatively small aperture, that they would
bear higher magnifying powers than had ever previously been applied;
but he found that a deficiency of light could only be remedied by an
increased diameter of the large speculum, which therefore was his main
object, when he undertook to accomplish a work which to a man less
enterprising, would have appeared impracticable. The difficulties he
had to overcome were numerous; particularly in the operative department
of preparing, melting, annealing, grinding, and polishing a mass of
metal that was too unwieldly to be moved without the aid of mechanical
powers. At length, however, all difficulties having been overcome,
this magnificent instrument was completed with all its complicated
apparatus, and erected for observation, on the 28th of August, 1789,
and on the same day the sixth satellite of Saturn was detected, as a
prelude of still farther discoveries which were afterwards made by this
instrument, in the celestial regions.

It would be too tedious to attempt a description of all the machinery
and apparatus connected with this noble instrument. The reader
who wishes to peruse a minute description of the stairs, ladders,
platform, rollers, and of every circumstance relating to joiner’s work,
carpenter’s work, smith’s work, and other particulars connected with
the formation and erection of this telescope, will find the details
recorded in the 85th volume of the Philosophical Transactions of the
Royal Society of London, for 1795, in which there are sixty-three pages
of letter press, and eighteen plates illustrative of the subject. I
shall content myself with giving a short outline of the essential parts
belonging to this instrument.

The _tube_ of this telescope is made of rolled or sheet iron, joined
together without rivets; the thickness of the sheets is somewhat less
than 1/36 part of an inch, or 14 pounds weight for a square foot;
great care was taken that the cylindrical form should be secured, and
the whole was coated over three or four times with paint, inside and
outside, to secure it against the damp. This tube was removed from
the place in which it was formed by twenty-four men, divided into six
sets; so that two men on each side, with a pole of 5 feet long in
their hands, to which was affixed a piece of course cloth, 7 feet long
going under the tube, and joined to a pole 5 feet long, in the hands
of two other men, assisted in carrying the tube. The _length_ of this
tube is 39 feet 4 inches, the diameter 4 feet 10 inches; and, on a
moderate computation, it was ascertained, that a wooden tube of proper
dimensions would have exceeded an iron one in weight by at least 3000
pounds. Reckoning the circumference of the tube 15 feet, its length
39-1/3 feet, and 14 lib. for the weight of a square foot, it must have
contained 590 square feet, and weighed 8,260 pounds. Various hoops were
fixed within the tube, and longitudinal bars of iron connecting some of
them are attached to the two ends of the tube, by way of bracing the
sheets, and preserving the shape perfect, when the pulleys are applied
to give the necessary elevation at the upper end, and that the speculum
may be kept secure at the lower end. The lower end of the tube is
firmly supported on rollers that are capable of being moved forwards or
backwards by a double rack, connected with a set of wheels and pinions.
By an adjustment at the lower extremity of the tube, the speculum is
turned to a small inclination, so that the line of collimation may not
be coincident with the longitudinal axis of the tube, but may cross the
tube diagonally, and meet the eye in the air at about two inches from
the edge of the tube, which is the peculiarity of the construction,
that supersedes the necessity of applying a second reflector. Hence no
part of the head of the observer intercepts the incident rays, and the
observation is taken with the face looking at the speculum, the back
being turned to the object to be observed.

The large speculum is enclosed in a strong iron ring, braced across
with bars of iron, and an enclosure of iron and ten sheets makes a case
for it. It is lifted by three handles of iron attached to the sides of
the ring, and is put into and taken out of its proper place in the tube
by the help of a moveable crane, running on a carriage, which operation
requires great care. The speculum is made of a metallic composition,
and is 49-1/2 inches in diameter; but the concave polished surface is
only 48 inches, or 4 feet in diameter. Its thickness is 31 inches; and
when it came from the cast its weight was 2118 pounds. The metals for
its formation were procured at a warehouse in Thames Street, London,
where they kept ingots of two kinds ready made, one of white, and the
other of bell-metal; and it was composed of two ingots of bell-metal
for one of white. It was not to be expected that a speculum of such
large dimensions, could have a perfect figure imparted to its surface,
nor that the curve, whatever it might be, would remain identically the
same in changes of temperature; therefore we are not surprised when we
are told, that the magnifying powers used with this telescope seldom
exceeded 200; the quantity of light collected by so large a surface
being the principal aim of the maker. The raising of the balcony, on
which the observer stands, and the sliding of the lower end of the
tube, in which the speculum rests, are effected by separate tackles,
and require only occasional motions; but the elevation of the telescope
requires the main tackle to be employed, and the motion usually given
in altitude at once was two degrees; the breadth of the zone in which
the observations were made, as the motion of the sphere in right
ascension brought the objects into view. A star, however, could be
followed for about a quarter of an hour. Three persons were employed
in using this telescope, one to work the tackle, another to observe,
and a third to mark down the observations. The elevation was pointed
out by a small quadrant fixed to the main tube, near the lower end, but
the polar distance was indicated by a piece of machinery, worked by a
string, which continually indicated the degree and minute on a dial in
the small house adjoining, while the time was shown by a clock in the
same place, Miss Herschel performing the office of Registrar.

At the upper end the tube is open, and directed to the part of the
heavens intended for observation, and the observer, standing on the
foot board, looks down the tube, and perceives the object by rays
reflected from the speculum, through the eye glass at the opening
of the tube. When the telescope is directed to any objects near the
zenith, the observer is necessarily at an elevation at least 40 feet
from the ground. Near the place of the eye glass is the end of a tin
pipe, into which a mouth-piece may be placed, so that, during an
observation, a person may direct his voice into this pipe, while his
eye is at the glass. This pipe, which is 1-1/2 inch in diameter runs
down to the bottom of the tube, where it goes into a turning joint,
thence into a drawing tube, and out of this into another turning joint,
from whence it proceeds, by a set of sliding tubes towards the front of
the foundation timber. Its use is to convey the voice of the observer
to his assistants, for at the last place, it divides itself into two
branches, one going into the observatory, the other into the workman’s
room, ascending in both places through the floor, and terminates in
the usual shape of speaking trumpets. Though the voice passes in this
manner through a tube, with many inflections, and through not less than
115 feet, it requires very little exertion to be well understood.

To direct so unwieldy a body to any part of the heavens at pleasure,
many mechanical contrivances were evidently necessary. The whole
apparatus rests upon rollers, and care was previously taken of the
foundation in the ground. This consists of concentrical brick walls,
the outermost 42 feet, the innermost 21 feet in diameter, 2 feet 6
inches deep under ground, 2 feet 3 inches broad at the bottom, and 1
foot 2 inches at the top, capped with paving stones 3 inches thick, and
12-3/4 inches broad.

In the centre is a large post of oak, framed together with braces under
ground, and walled fast to brick-work to make it steady. Round this
centre the whole frame is moved horizontally by means of 20 rollers,
12 upon the outer, and 8 upon the inner wall. The vertical motion is
given to the instrument by means of ropes and pullies, passing over the
main beam supported by the ladders. These ladders are 49 feet long,
and there is a moveable gallery with 24 rollers to ease its motion.
There is a stair-case intended for persons who wish to ascend into the
gallery, without being obliged to go up the ladder. The ease with which
the horizontal and vertical motions may be communicated to the tube
may be conceived, from a remark of Sir W. Herschel, that, in the year
1789, he several times observed Saturn, two or three hours before and
after its meridian passage with one single person to continue, at his
directions, the necessary horizontal and vertical motions.

By this telescope the sixth and seventh satellites of Saturn were
discovered, only one of which is within the reach of the 20 feet
reflector, or even of a 25 feet instrument. The discovery of the
satellites of the planet Uranus, however, was made by the 20 feet
reflector, but only after it had been converted from the Newtonian to
the Herschelian construction--which affords a proof of the superiority
of the latter construction over the former when the same speculum is
used. Never had the heavens before been observed with so extraordinary
an instrument as the forty feet reflector. The nebulosities which
are found among the fixed stars, in various regions of the heavens,
appeared almost all to resolve themselves into an innumerable
multitude of stars; others, hitherto imperceptible, seemed to have
acquired a distinct light. On the entrance of Sirius into the field
of the telescope, the eye was so violently affected, that stars of
less magnitude could not immediately after be perceived; and it was
necessary to wait for 20 minutes before these stars could be observed.
The ring of Saturn had always before ceased to be visible when its
plane was directed towards the earth; but the feeble light which it
reflects in that position was enough for Herschel’s instrument, and the
ring, even then, still remained visible to him.

It has been generally considered that this telescope was capable of
carrying a power of 6000 times; and perhaps for the purpose of an
experiment, and for trying its effect on certain objects, such a power
may have been applied,--in which case the eye-glass must have been
only 2/25 of an inch focal distance, or somewhat less than one twelfth
of an inch. But such a power could not be generally applied, with any
good effect, to the planetary bodies; and I question much whether any
power above 1000 times was ever generally used. For, it is the quantity
of light which the telescope collects, more than the magnifying power,
that enables us to penetrate, with effect, into the distant spaces of
the firmament: and hence, as above stated, the power seldom exceeded
200, which on account of the large diameter of the speculum, would
enable the instrument to penetrate into the distant celestial spaces
perhaps further than if a power of as many thousands of times had been
applied.

Sir John Herschel, who inherits all the science, skill, and industry of
his father, some time ago ground and polished a new speculum for the 20
feet tube, formerly noticed, which is connected with a stand, pulleys
and other appendages, similar to those above described, though of
smaller dimensions. This telescope shows the double stars exceedingly
well defined, and was one of the principal instruments used in forming
his catalogue of these objects which was presented to the Royal
Society, in conjunction with that of Sir James South, about the year
1828. I suppose, it is likewise the same telescope with which Sir John
lately made his Sidereal observations at the Cape of Good Hope.


SECT. 3.--RAMAGE’S LARGE REFLECTING TELESCOPE.

The largest _front view_ reflecting telescope in this country--next
to Herschel’s 40 feet instrument--is that which was erected at the
Royal Observatory at Greenwich, in the year 1820, by Mr. Ramage of
Aberdeen. The diameter of the concave reflector is 15 inches, and its
focal length 25 feet. It is erected on machinery which bears a certain
resemblance to that of Herschel’s, which we have now described; but the
mechanical arrangements are greatly simplified, so that the instrument
is manageable by an observer without an assistant. The tube is composed
of a twelve-sided prism of deal 5/8 inch thick. At the mouth is a
double cylinder of different diameters on the same axis; around this a
cord is wound by a winch, and passes up from the small cylinder, over
a pulley, and down through another pulley on to the large cylinder.
When the winch, therefore, is turned to raise the telescope, the
endless cord is unwound from the smaller cylinder, and wound on to the
larger, the difference of the size of the two cylinders will be double
the quantity raised, and a mechanical force to any extent may thus be
obtained, by duly proportioning the diameters of the two cylinders: by
this contrivance the necessity of an assistant is superseded. The view
through this instrument first astonished those observers who had not
been accustomed to examine a heavenly body with a telescope possessing
so much light; and its performance was deemed quite extraordinary. But
when the first impression had subsided, and different trials had been
made in different states of the atmosphere, it was discovered that the
central portion of the speculum was more perfectly figured than the
ring bordering on the extreme edges. When the aperture was limited to
ten or twelve inches, the performance as to the distinctness in its
defining power, was greatly improved, and the light was so brilliant,
that the Astronomer Royal was disposed to entertain an opinion, that it
might equal that of a good achromatic refractor of the same dimensions.
When, however, very small and obscure objects are to be observed,
the whole light of the entire aperture may be used with advantage on
favourable evenings.

The eye-pieces adapted to this telescope have powers which magnify
the object linearly from 100 to 1500 times, which are competent to
fulfil all the purposes of vision when cleared of aberration. When the
telescope is placed in the plane of the meridian and elevated together
with the gallery, into any required altitude, the _meridional sweeps_,
formerly practised by Sir W. Herschel, and continued by Sir John with
great success, in the examination of double stars and nebula, may be
managed with great ease.

Mr. Ramage had a telescope of about the same size, erected in an open
space in Aberdeen, which I had an opportunity of inspecting when I
paid a visit to that gentleman in 1833; but cloudy weather prevented
my obtaining a view of any celestial bodies through it. He showed me
at that time two or three large speculums, from 12 to 18 inches in
diameter, which he had finished some time before, and which appeared
most beautifully polished. He told me, too, that he had ground and
polished them simply with his hand, without the aid of any machinery
or mechanical power--a circumstance which, he said, astonished the
opticians of London, when it was stated, and which they considered as
almost incredible. His experience in casting and polishing metals of
various sizes, during a period of 15 or 16 years, qualified him to
prepare specula of great lustre, and with an unusually high polish. It
has been asserted that a fifty feet telescope by Ramage of 21 inches
aperture was intended to be substituted for the 25 feet instrument
erected at Greenwich, and the speculum it is understood, was prepared,
and ready for use, provided the Navy Board was disposed to defray the
expense of carrying the plan into execution. But, unfortunately, this
ingenious artist was unexpectedly cut off in the midst of his career,
about the year 1835.


SECT. 4.--THE AERIAL REFLECTOR--CONSTRUCTED BY THE AUTHOR.

A particular description of this telescope was given in the ‘Edinburgh
New Philosophical Journal’ for April--July, 1826, conducted by
Professor Jameson, the greater part of which was copied in the ‘London
Encyclopedia,’ ] under the article _Telescope_. From this description I
shall endeavour to condense a brief account of this instrument with a
few additional remarks.

About the year 1822, an old speculum 27 inches in focal length, very
imperfectly polished happened accidentally to come into my possession;
and feeling no inclination to fit it up in the Gregorian form, I formed
the resolution of throwing aside the small speculum, and attempting
the _front view_ notwithstanding the uniform assertion of opticians,
that such an attempt in instruments of a small size is impracticable.
I had some ground for expecting success in this attempt, from several
experiments I had previously made, particularly from some modifications
I had made in the construction of astronomical eye-pieces, which have
a tendency to correct the aberration of the rays of light, when they
proceed somewhat obliquely from a lens or speculum. In the first
instance, I placed the speculum at the one end of a tube of the form
of a segment of a cone--the end next the eye being somewhat wider
than that at which the speculum was fixed, and its length about an
inch shorter than the focal distance of the mirror. A small tube for
receiving the different eye-pieces was fixed in the inside of the large
tube at the end next the eye, and connected with an apparatus by which
it could occasionally be moved either in a vertical or horizontal
direction. With the instrument fitted up in this manner, I obtained
some interesting views of the moon, and of terrestrial objects. But
finding that one side of the tube intercepted a considerable portion of
light from the object, I determined to throw aside the tube altogether,
and to fit up the instrument on a different plan.

A short mahogany tube, about 3 inches long, was prepared, to serve as
a socket for holding the speculum. To the side of this tube an arm was
attached, about the length of the focal distance of the mirror, at
the extremity of which a brass tube for receiving the eye-pieces, was
fixed, connected with screws and sockets, by which it might be raised
or depressed, and turned to the right hand or to the left, and with
adjusting apparatus by which it might be brought nearer to or farther
from the speculum. Fig. 69 exhibits a general representation of the
instrument in profile. AB is the short tube which holds the speculum;
CD the arm which carries the eye-tubes, which consists of two distinct
pieces of mahogany; the part D being capable of sliding along the under
side of C, through the brass sockets EF. To the under part of the
socket F is attached a brass nut with a female screw, in which the male
screw _ab_ acts by applying the hand to the knob _c_, which serves for
adjusting the instrument to distinct vision. G is the brass tube which
receives the eye-pieces. It is supported by a strong brass wire _de_,
which passes through a nut connected with another strong wire, which
passes through the arm D. By means of the nut _f_ this tube may be
elevated or depressed, and firmly fixed in its proper position; and by
the nut _d_ it may be brought nearer to or further from, the arm D.

[Illustration: _figure 69._]

By the same apparatus, it is also rendered capable of being moved
either in a vertical or horizontal direction: but when it is once
adjusted to its proper position, it must be firmly fixed, and requires
no further attention. The eye-piece represented in this figure is the
one used for terrestrial objects, which consists of the tubes belonging
to a pocket achromatic telescope. When an astronomical eye-piece is
used, the length of the instrument extends only to the point I. In
looking through this telescope, the right eye is applied at the point
H, and the observer’s head is understood to be uncovered, or, at
least, tightly covered with a thin cap. For those who use only the
left eye, the arm would require to be placed on the opposite side of
the tube, or the arm, along with the tube, be made to turn round 180
degrees.

[Illustration: _figure 70._]

Fig. 70 represents a front, or rather an oblique view of the
instrument, in which the position of the speculum may be seen. All the
specula which I fitted up in this form, having been originally intended
for Gregorian reflectors, have holes in their centres. The eye-piece
is therefore directed to a point nearly equi-distant from the hole to
the left hand edge of the speculum, that is, to the point _a_. In one
of these instruments fitted up with a four feet speculum, the line
of vision is directed to the point _b_ on the opposite side of the
speculum, but, in this case, the eye-tube is removed farther from the
arm, than in the former case. The hole in the centre of the speculum is
obviously a defect in this construction of a reflecting telescope, as
it prevents us from obtaining the full advantage of the rays which fall
near the centre of the mirror; yet the performance of the instruments,
even with this disadvantage, is superior to what we should previously
have been led to expect.

The principal nicety in the construction of this instrument, consists
in the adjustment and proper direction of the eye-tube. There is only
one position in which vision will be perfectly distinct. It must be
neither too high nor too low,--it must be fixed at a certain distance
from the arm,--and must be directed to a certain point of the speculum.
This position must be ultimately determined by experiment, when viewing
terrestrial objects. A person unacquainted with this construction
of the telescope, would, perhaps, find it difficult, in the first
instance, to make this adjustment; but were it at any time deranged,
through accident or otherwise, I can easily make the adjustment anew,
in the course of a minute or two.

In pointing this telescope to the object intended to be viewed, the
eye is applied at K, fig, 69, and looking along the arm, towards the
eye-piece, till it nearly coincide with the object, it will, in most
cases, be readily found. In this way I can easily point this instrument
to Jupiter or Saturn, or to any of the other planets, visible to the
naked eye, even when a power of 160 or 170 times is applied. When high
magnifying powers, however, are used, it may be expedient to fix,
on the upper part of the short tube in which the speculum rests, a
Finder, such as that which is used in Newtonian telescopes. When the
moon is the object intended to be viewed, she may be instantly found by
moving the instrument till her reflected image be seen from the eye-end
of the telescope on the face of the mirror.

I have fitted up several instruments of the above description with
specula of 16, 27, 35, and 49 inches focal distance. One of these
having a speculum of 27 inches focal length, and an astronomical
eye-piece, producing a magnifying power of about 90 times, serves
as a good astronomical telescope. By this instrument the belts
and satellites of Jupiter, the ring of Saturn, and the mountains
and cavities of the moon, may be contemplated with great ease and
distinctness. With a magnifying power of 35 or 40 times, terrestrial
objects appear remarkably bright and well-defined. When compared with
a Gregorian, the quantity of light upon the object appears nearly
doubled, and the image is equally distinct--although the speculum has
several blemishes, and its surface is but imperfectly polished. It
represents objects in their natural colours, without that dingy and
yellowish tinge which appears when looking through a Gregorian. Another
of these instruments is about four feet long. The speculum which
belongs to it is a very old one: when it came into my possession, it
was so completely tarnished, as scarcely to reflect a ray of light.
After it was cleaned, it appeared to be scarcely half polished, and
its surface is covered with yellowish stains which cannot be erased.
Were it fitted up upon the Gregorian plan, it would, I presume, be
of very little use, unless when a very small magnifying power was
applied. Yet, in its present form, it bears, with distinctness, a
magnifying power of 130 times, and is equal in its performance to a
3-1/2 feet achromatic. It exhibits distinct and interesting views of
the diversities of shade, and of the mountains, vales, cavities, and
other inequalities of the moon’s surface. With a power of about 50
times, and a terrestrial eye-piece, it forms an excellent telescope
for land objects, and exhibits them in a brilliant and novel aspect.
The smallest instrument I have attempted to construct on this plan,
is only 5-1/2 inches focal distance, and 1-3/4 inch diameter. With a
magnifying power of about 15 times, it shows terrestrial objects with
distinctness and brilliancy. But I should deem it inexpedient to fit
up any instrument of this description with specula of a shorter focal
distance than 20 or 24 inches. The longer the focal distance the more
distinctness may be expected, although the aperture of the speculum
should be comparatively small.

The following are some of the properties and advantages peculiar to
this construction of the reflecting telescope.

1. It is _extremely simple_, and may be fitted up at a comparatively
_small expense_. Instead of large and expensive brass tubes, such as
are used in the Gregorian and Newtonian construction, little more is
required than a short mahogany tube, two or three inches long, to
serve as a socket for the speculum, with an arm connected with it
about the focal length of the speculum. The expense of small specula,
either plain or concave, is saved, together with the numerous screws,
springs, &c., for centering the two specula, and placing the small
mirror parallel to the large one. The only adjustment requisite in this
construction, is that of the eye-tube to the speculum; and, by means of
the simple apparatus above described, it can be effected in the course
of a few minutes. Almost the whole expense of the instrument consists
in the price of the speculum and the eye-pieces. The expense of fitting
up the four feet speculum, alluded to above--_exclusive of speculum and
eye-piece_--but including mahogany tube and arm, brass sockets, screws,
eye-tube, brass joint, and a cast-iron stand painted and varnished,
did not amount to £1 : 8_s_. A Gregorian of the same size would have
required a brass tube at least 4-1/2 feet in length, which would cost 5
or 6 guineas, besides the apparatus connected with the small speculum,
and the additional expense connected with the fitting up of the joint
and stand requisite for supporting and steadying so unwieldy an
instrument. While the one instrument would require two persons to carry
it from one room to another, and would occupy a considerable space in
an ordinary apartment, the other can be moved, with the utmost ease,
with one hand, to any moderate distance, and the space it occupies is
extremely small.

2. _It is more convenient for viewing celestial objects at a high
altitude, than other telescopes._ When we look through a Gregorian
reflector or an achromatic telescope of 4 or 5 feet in length, to an
object elevated 50 or 60 degrees above the horizon, the body requires
to be placed in an uneasy and distorted position, and the eye is
somewhat strained, while the observation is continued. But when
viewing similar objects by the _Aerial Reflector_, we can either stand
perfectly erect, or sit on a chair, with the same ease as we sit at a
desk when reading a book or writing a letter. In this way, the surface
of the moon or any of the planets, may be contemplated for an hour or
two, without the least weariness or fatigue. A delineation of the
lunar surface may be taken with this instrument with more ease and
accuracy than with any other instrument, as the observer can sketch
the outline of the object by one eye on a tablet placed a little below
the eye-piece, while the other eye is looking at the object. For the
purpose of accommodating the instrument to a sitting or standing
posture a small table was constructed, capable of being elevated or
depressed at pleasure, on which the stand of the telescope is placed.
When the telescope is 4 or 5 feet long, and the object at a very high
elevation, the instrument may be placed on the floor of the apartment,
and the observer will stand in an erect position.

3. This instrument is considerably _shorter_ than a Gregorian telescope
whose mirror is of the same focal length. When an astronomical
eye-piece is used, the whole length of the instrument is nothing more
than the focal length of the speculum. But a Gregorian whose large
speculum is 4 feet focus, will be nearly 5 feet in length, including
the eye-piece.

4. The Aerial Reflector far excels the Gregorian in brightness. The
deficiency of light in the Gregorians is owing to the second reflection
from the small mirror; for it has been proved by experiment that nearly
the one half of the rays of light which fall upon a reflecting surface
is lost by a second reflection. The image of the object may also be
presumed to be more correct, as it is not liable to any distortion by
being reflected from another speculum.

5. There is _less tremor_ in these telescopes than in Gregorian
Reflectors. One cause, among others, of the tremors complained of in
Gregorians is, I presume, the formation of a second image at a great
distance from the first, besides that which arises from the elastic
tremor of the small speculum, when carried by an arm supported only
at one end. But as the image formed by the speculum in the aerial
telescope is viewed _directly_, without being exposed to any subsequent
reflection, it is not so liable to the tremors which are so frequently
experienced in other reflectors. Notwithstanding the length of the arm
of the 4 feet telescope above mentioned, a celestial object appears
remarkably steady, when passing across the field of view, especially
when it is at a moderate degree of altitude; and it is easily kept in
the field by a gentle motion applied to the arm of the instrument.

In prosecuting my experiments in relation to these instruments, I
wished to ascertain what effect might be produced by using a _part of
a speculum_ instead of the whole. For this purpose, I cut a speculum,
three feet in focal length, through the centre, so as to divide it
into two equal parts, and fitted up each part as a distinct telescope;
so that I obtained two telescopes from one speculum. In this case I
found that each half of the speculum performed nearly as well as the
whole speculum had done before, at least there appeared to be _no
very sensible_ diminution in the _brightness_ of the object, when
viewed with a moderate power, and the image was equally accurate and
distinct; so that if _economy_ were a particular object aimed at in
the construction of these instruments, two good telescopes might be
obtained from one speculum; or if a speculum happened to be broken
accidentally into large fragments, one or more of the fragments might
be fitted up on this principle to serve as a tolerably good telescope.

From the experiments I have made in reference to these instruments, it
is demonstrable, that _a tube is not necessary_ in the construction of
a reflecting telescope--at least on the principle now stated--whether
it be used by day or by night for terrestrial or celestial objects;
for I have frequently used these telescopes in the open air in the day
time, without any inconvenience from extraneous light. Therefore, were
a reflecting telescope of 50 or 60 feet in length to be constructed, it
might be fitted up at a comparatively small expence, after the expense
of the metallic substances, and of casting, grinding, and polishing
the speculum is defrayed. The largest instrument of this description
which has hitherto been constructed is the 40 feet reflector of Sir
W. Herschel. This complicated and most unwieldy instrument had a tube
of rolled or sheet iron 39 feet 4 inches in length, about 15 feet in
circumference, and weighed about 8000 pounds. Now, I conceive that
such enormous tubes, in instruments of such dimensions, are altogether
unnecessary. Nothing more is requisite than a short tube for holding
the speculum. Connected with one side of this tube (or with both sides
were it found necessary), two strong bars of wood, projecting a few
feet beyond the speculum end, and extending in front as far as the
focal length of the mirror, and connected by cross bars of wood, iron
or brass--would be quite sufficient for a support to the eye-piece, and
for directing the motion of the instrument. A telescope of 40 or 50
feet in length, constructed on this plan, would not require one fifth
of the expense, nor one fourth of the apparatus and mechanical power
for moving it to any required position, which were found necessary
in the construction of Sir W. Herschel’s large reflecting telescope.
The idea here suggested will perhaps be more readily appreciated by
an inspection of fig. 71, where A is the short tube, BC and DE the
two large bars or arms, connected with cross bars, for the purpose of
securing strength and steadiness. At I and K, behind the speculum,
weights might be applied, if necessary, for counterbalancing the lever
power of the long arm. F represents the position of the eye-piece,
and GH the joint and part of the pedestal on which the instrument is
placed. With regard to telescopes of smaller dimensions, as from 5
to 15 feet in focal length--with the exception of the expense of the
specula and eye-pieces--they might be fitted up for a sum not greater
than from 3 to 10 or 15 guineas.

[Illustration: _figure 71._]

Were any person to attempt the construction of those telescopes, it
is possible he might not succeed in his first attempts without more
minute directions than I have yet given. The following directions
may perhaps tend to guide the experimenter in adjusting the eye-tube
to the speculum, which is a point that requires to be particularly
attended to, and on which depends the accurate performance of the
instrument. After having fixed the eye-piece nearly in the position
it should occupy, and directed the instrument to a particular object,
look along the arm of the telescope, from K (fig. 69.) to the extremity
of the eye-piece at H, and observe, whether it nearly coincides with
the object. If the object appear lower than this line of vision, the
eye-piece must be lowered, and if higher, it must be raised, by means
of the nuts and screws at _gd_ and _fe_, till the object and the line
of vision now stated nearly coincide. The eye-piece should be directed
as nearly perpendicular to the front of the speculum as possible, but
so that the reflected image of one’s head from the mirror shall not
interfere to obstruct the rays from the object. An object may be seen
with an approximate degree of distinctness, but not accurately, unless
this adjustment be pretty accurately made. The astronomical eye-pieces
used for these telescopes are fitted with a brass cap which slides on
the end next the eye, and is capable of being brought nearer to or
farther from the first eye-glass. In the centre of this cap, next the
eye, is a small hole, about the 1/40th or 1/50th of an inch diameter,
or about as wide as to admit the point of a pin or a moderate-sized
needle. The distance of this hole from the lens next the eye must be
adjusted by trial, till the whole field of view appear distinct. A
common astronomical eye-piece, without this addition, does not answer
well. I find by experience, that terrestrial eye-pieces, such as those
used in good achromatic telescopes, are, on the whole, best adapted to
this construction of a reflecting telescope.

I have sometimes used these instruments for the purpose of viewing
perspective prints, which they exhibit in a beautiful and interesting
manner. If a coloured perspective be placed at one end of a large
room or gallery, and strongly illuminated either by the sun or by two
candles, and one of the reflectors furnished with a _small magnifying
power_, placed at the opposite end of the room--the representation of
a street or a landscape will be seen in its true perspective, and will
appear even more pleasant and interesting than when viewed through
the common _optical diagonal machine_. If an inverting eye-piece be
used--which is most eligible in this experiment--the print, of course,
must be placed in an inverted position.

That reflecting telescopes of the descriptions now stated are original
in their construction, appears from the uniform language of optical
writers, some of whom have pronounced such attempts to be altogether
impracticable. Sir David Brewster, one of the latest and most
respectable writers on this subject, in the ‘Edinburgh Encyclopedia’
art _optics_, and in the last edition of his _appendix_ to ‘Ferguson’s
Lectures,’ has the following remarks:--‘If we could dispense with
the use of the small specula in telescopes of moderate length, by
inclining the great speculum, and using an oblique, and consequently
a _distorted_ reflection, as proposed first by La Maire, we should
consider the Newtonian telescope as perfect; and on a large scale, or
when the instrument exceeds 20 feet, it has undoubtedly this character,
as nothing can be more simple than to magnify, by a single eye-glass,
the image formed by a single speculum. As the _front view is quite
impracticable_, and indeed _has never been attempted_ in instruments
of a small size, it becomes of great practicable consequence to remove
as much as possible, the evils which arise from the use of a small
speculum,’ &c.

The instruments now described have effectuated, in some degree, the
desirable object alluded to by this distinguished philosopher, and
the mode of construction is neither that of Sir W. Herschel’s front
view, nor does it coincide with that proposed by La Maire, which
appears to have been a mere hint that was never realized in the
construction of reflecting telescopes of a small size. The simplicity
of the construction of these instruments, and the excellence of their
performance, have been much admired by several scientific gentlemen and
others to whom they have been exhibited. Prior to the description of
them in the Edin. Philos. Journal, they were exhibited in the Calton
Hill Observatory, Edinburgh, in the presence of Professor Wallace,
and another gentleman, who compared their performance with that of an
excellent Gregorian. As this instrument is distinguished from every
other telescope, in being used without a tube, it has been denominated
‘_The aerial reflector_.’


SECT. 4.--EARL OF ROSSE’S REFLECTING TELESCOPES.

This nobleman, unlike many of his compeers, has, for a considerable
number of years past, devoted his attention to the pursuits of science,
and particularly to the improvement of reflecting telescopes. He is
evidently possessed of high mathematical attainments, combined with
an uncommon degree of mechanical ingenuity. About 14 or 15 years ago,
he engaged in various experiments with the view of counteracting the
effects of the spherical aberration of the specula of reflecting
telescopes--which imperfection, if it could be completely remedied,
would render the reflecting telescope almost a perfect instrument,
as it is not affected by the different refrangibility of the rays of
light. His method, we believe, consisted in forming a large speculum of
two or three separate pieces of metal, which were afterwards accurately
combined into one--a central part which was surrounded by one or two
rings ground on the same tool. When the images formed by the separate
pieces, were made exactly to coincide, the image of the object towards
which the whole speculum was directed, was then found to be as distinct
as either image had been when separate. But at the period referred to,
a sufficient number of experiments had not been made to determine that
his lordship had completely accomplished the object he intended.

Great interest, however, has of late been excited by the improvements
which his lordship has made in the formation of specula. Sir W.
Herschel never made public the means by which he succeeded in giving
such gigantic developement to the reflecting telescope: and therefore
the construction of a _large_ reflector has been considered as a
perilous adventure. But, according to a report of Dr. Robinson of
Armagh, to the Irish academy, the Earl of Rosse has overcome the
difficulties which have hitherto been met with, and carried to an
extent which even Herschel himself did not venture to contemplate,
the illuminating power of this telescope, along with a sharpness
of definition little inferior to that of the achromatic; and it is
scarcely possible, he observes, to preserve the necessary sobriety of
language in speaking of the moon’s appearance with this instrument,
which Dr. Robinson believes to be the most powerful ever constructed.
The difficulty of constructing large specula, and of imparting to them
the requisite degree of polish, has hitherto been considered so great,
that from 8 to 12 inches diameter has been in general their utmost
size. Indeed, except with the greatest reluctance, London opticians
would not accept of orders for specula of more than 9 inches in
diameter. It appears, however, that the Earl of Rosse has succeeded,
by a peculiar method of moulding, in casting object-mirrors of true
_speculum metal of three feet in diameter, and of a weight exceeding
17 cwt_. He is about to construct a telescope, the speculum of which
is _six feet_ in diameter, _fifty feet focal distance_, and of the
weight of _four tons_; and from what he has already accomplished, it
is not doubted that he possesses the power to carry his design into
effect. These great masses of metal, which, in the hands of all other
makers of specula would have been as untractable as so much unannealed
flint-glass, the Earl of Rosse has further succeeded in bringing to
the highest degree of polish, and the utmost perfection of curvature
by means of machinery. The process is conducted under water, by which
means those variations of temperature, so fatal to the finest specula
hitherto attempted, are effectually guarded against. To convince Dr.
Robinson of the efficacy of this machinery, the earl took the three
feet speculum out of its telescope, destroyed its polished surface,
and placed it under the mechanical polisher. In six hours it was
taken out with a perfect new surface as bright as the original. Under
the old system of hand-polishing, it might have required months,
and even years, to effect this restoration. Even before achieving
these extraordinary triumphs on the solid substance, his lordship
had constructed a six feet reflector by covering a curved surface of
brass with squares of the true _speculum metal_, which gave an immense
quantity of light, though subject to some irregularities, arising
from the number of joinings necessary in such a mosaic work. Of the
performance of his lordship’s great telescope, mounted with this
reflector, those who have seen it speak in terms of high admiration;
but in reference to the smaller and more perfect instrument, furnished
with the solid three feet speculum, the language of the Armagh
astronomer assumes a tone of enthusiasm and even of sublimity. By means
of this exquisite instrument, Dr. Robinson and Sir J. South, in the
intervals of a rather unfavourable night, saw several new stars, and
corrected numerous errors of other observers. For example, the planet
Uranus, supposed to possess a ring similar to that of Saturn, was found
not to have any such appendage; and those nebulæ, hitherto regarded,
from their apparently circular outline, as ‘coalescing systems,’
appeared, when tested by the three feet speculum, to be very far
indeed from presenting a globular appearance; numerous off-shoots and
appendages, invisible by other telescopes, appearing in all directions
radiating from their edges. Such discoveries, which reflect great
honour on the Earl of Rosse, will doubtless have great effect on the
interests of astronomical science.[27]


SECT. 5.--REFLECTING TELESCOPES WITH GLASS SPECULA.

After making a variety of experiments with aerial telescopes
constructed of metallic specula of different focal lengths, I
constructed a telescope on the same plan, with a concave glass mirror.
Having obtained a fragment of a very large convex mirror which happened
accidentally to have been broken, I caused the convex side to be
foliated, or silverised, and found its focal length to be about 27
inches. This mirror, which was about 5 inches diameter, I placed in one
of the aerial reflectors, instead of the metallic speculum, and tried
its effects with different terrestrial eye-pieces. With a power of
about 35 or 40 times, it gave a beautiful and splendid view of distant
terrestrial objects--the quantity of light reflected from them, being
considerably greater than when a metallic speculum was used, and they
appeared on the whole well-defined. The only imperfection--as I had
foreseen--consisted in a double image being formed of objects which
were remarkably bright and white, such as a light-house whitened on
the outside, and strongly illuminated by the sun. One of the images
was bright and the other faint. This was obviously owing to the two
reflections from the two surfaces of the mirror--one from the convex
silverised side, and the other from the concave side next the eye,
which produced the faint image--which circumstance has been generally
considered as a sufficient reason for rejecting the use of glass
specula in telescopes. But although very bright objects exhibited
a double image, almost all the other objects in the terrestrial
landscape appeared quite distinct and without any secondary image, so
that a common observer could scarcely have noticed any imperfection.
When the instrument, however, was directed to celestial objects, the
secondary image was somewhat vivid, so that every object appeared
double. Jupiter appeared with two bodies, at a little distance from
each other, and his four satellites appeared increased to eight.
The moon likewise appeared as a double orb, but the principal image
was distinct and well-defined. Such a telescope, therefore, was not
well-adapted for celestial observations, but might answer well enough
for viewing terrestrial objects.

Considering that the injurious effects of the secondary image arose
from the images reflected from the two surfaces being formed near the
same point, and at nearly the same focal distance, I formed a plan for
destroying the secondary image, or at least counteracting its effects,
by forming the concavity of the mirror next the eye of a portion of a
sphere _different_ from that of the convex side which was silverised,
and from which the principal image is formed. But, for a long time, I
could find no opticians possessed of tools of a sufficient length of
radii for accomplishing my design. At length a London working optician
undertook to finish a glass speculum, according to my directions,
which were, that the convex surface of the mirror should be ground on
a tool which would produce a focal distance by reflection of about 4
feet; and that the concave surface should have its focal distance at
about 3 feet 3 inches, so that the secondary image might be formed
at about 9 inches, within the focal distance of the silverised side,
and not interfere to disturb the principal image. But, either from
ignorance or inattention, the artist mistook the radius for the half
radius of concavity, and the speculum turned out to be only 23 inches
focal distance by reflection. This mirror was fitted up as a telescope,
on the aerial plan, and I found, as I expected, the secondary image
completely destroyed. It produced a very beautiful and brilliant view
of land objects, and even the brightest objects exhibited no double
image. The mirror was nearly 5 inches in diameter, but the image was
most accurately defined when the aperture was contracted to about 3
inches. It was fitted with a terrestrial eye-piece which produced a
magnifying power of about 25 times. When directed to the moon, it
gave a very distinct and luminous view of that orb, without the least
appearance of a secondary image. But as the focal distance of the
speculum was scarcely half the length I had prescribed, I did not
apply to it any high astronomical powers; as I find, that these can
only be applied with effect, in this construction, to a speculum of a
considerable focal length. Happening to have at hand a convex lens 10
feet focal length, and 4 inches in diameter--the one side of which had
been ground to a certain degree of concavity--I caused the convex side
to be foliated, which produced a focus by reflection, at 13-1/2 inches
distant. To this mirror I applied terrestrial powers of 15 and 24, with
considerable distinctness. The power of 15 produced a very brilliant
and distinct view of land objects. Had the mirror been at least 3 times
the focal length, it would have formed an excellent telescope, with the
same aperture.


SECT. 6.--A REFLECTING TELESCOPE, WITH A SINGLE MIRROR AND NO EYE-PIECE.

[Illustration: _figure 72._]

On the same principle as that by which a refracting telescope may be
constructed by means of a single lens--as represented fig. 51, (page
234) we may form a telescope by reflection with a single mirror, and
without an eye-piece. Let AB, fig. 72, represent a large concave
speculum, and C its focus--if an eye be placed at D, about 8 or 10
inches within the focal point C, all the objects in the direction of C,
or behind the spectator, will be seen magnified by reflection on the
face of the mirror, and strongly illuminated. The magnifying power, in
this case, will be nearly in the proportion of the focal length of the
mirror to the focal length of the eye for near objects. If for example,
the focal distance of the mirror be 8 feet, and the distance from the
eye at which we see near objects most distinctly, be 8 inches--the
magnifying power will be in the ratio of 8 to 96, or 12 times. I have
a glass mirror of this description, whose focal length is 4 feet 8
inches, and diameter 6 inches, which magnifies distant objects about 7
times, takes in a large field of view, and exhibits objects with great
brilliancy. It presents a very distinct picture of the moon, showing
the different streaks of light and shade upon her surface; and, in some
cases, shows the larger spots which traverse the solar disc. This mode
of viewing objects is extremely easy and pleasant, especially when the
mirror is of a large diameter; and the observer is at first struck and
gratified with the novel aspect in which the objects appear.

Were a concave mirror of this description--whether of glass or of
speculum metal--to be formed to a very long focus, the magnifying
power would be considerable. One of 50 feet focal length, and of a
corresponding diameter, might produce a magnifying power, to certain
eyes, of about 75 times; and, from the quantity of light with which the
object would be seen, its effect would be much greater than the same
power applied to a common telescope. Sir W. Herschel states, that, on
one occasion, by looking with his naked eye on the speculum of his 40
feet Reflector, without the interposition of any lens or mirror, he
perceived distinctly one of the satellites of Saturn, which requires
the application of a considerable power to be seen by an ordinary
telescope. Such an instrument is one of the most simple forms of a
telescope, and would exhibit a brilliant and interesting view of the
moon, or of terrestrial objects.

ON THE EYE-PIECES OF TELESCOPES.

Although the performance of telescopes chiefly depends on the goodness
of the object-glass, or the object-speculum of the instrument, yet it
is of considerable importance, in order to distinct vision, and to
obtain a large and uniformly distinct field of view, that the eye-piece
be properly constructed. The different kinds of eye-pieces may be
arranged into two general divisions--_Astronomical_ and _terrestrial_.

1. _Astronomical eye-pieces._--The most simple astronomical eye-piece
is that which consists of a single convex lens; and when the focal
distance of this lens, and that of the object-glass of the instrument
is accurately ascertained, the magnifying power may be nicely
determined, by dividing the focal length of the object-lens by that
of the eye-glass. But, as the pencil of white light transmitted by
the object-glass, will be divided by the eye-glass into its component
colours, the object will appear bordered with coloured fringes, and the
distinctness of vision consequently injured. Besides, the spherical
aberration, when a single lens is used, is much greater than when two
or more glasses are employed. Hence astronomical eye-pieces are now
formed by a combination of at least two lenses.

[Illustration: _figure 73._]

The combination of lenses now generally used for astronomical purposes,
is that which is usually denominated the _Huygenian eye-piece_, having
been first proposed by the celebrated Huygens, as a great improvement
on the single lens eye-piece. The following figure (73) represents a
section of this eye-piece. Let AB be a compounded pencil of white light
proceeding from the object-glass; BF a plano-convex field-glass, with
its plane side next the eye-glass E. The red rays of the pencil AB,
after refraction would cross the axis in R, and the violet rays in V,
but meeting the eye-glass E, the red rays will be refracted to O, and
the violet nearly in the same direction, when they will cross each
other about the point O, in the axis, and unite. The distance of the
two glasses FE, to produce this correction, when made of crown glass,
must be equal to half the sum of their focal distances nearly. For
example, suppose the focal distance of the largest, or field lens, to
be 3 inches, and the focal distance of the lens next the eye, 1 inch,
the two lenses should be placed exactly at the distance of 2 inches;
the sum of their focal length being 4, the half of which is 2. In other
words, the glass next the eye should be placed as much _within_ the
focus of the field-glass as is equal to its own focal distance. The
focal length of a single lens, that has the same magnifying power as
this compound eye-piece--is equal to twice the product of the focal
lengths of the two lenses, divided by the sum of the same numbers.
Or, it is equal to half the focal length of the field-glass. Thus, in
reference to the preceding example, twice the product of the focal
length of the two lenses--is equal to 6, and their sum is 4. The former
number divided by the latter, produces a quotient of 1-1/2, which
is the focal length of a single lens, which would produce the same
magnifying power as the eye-piece; and 1½ is just half the focal length
of the field-glass. The proportion of the focal lengths of the two
lenses to each other, according to Huygens, should be as 3 to 1; that
is, if the field-glass be 4-1/2 inches, the eye-glass should be 1-1/2;
and this is the proportion most generally adopted. But some opticians
have recommended that the proportions should be as 3 to 2. Boscovich
recommended two similar lenses; and in this case the distance between
them was equal to half the sum of their focal distances, as in the
Huygenian eye-piece.

The image is formed at IM, at the focal distance of the lens next the
eye, and at the same distance from the field-glass. When distinct
vision is the principal object of an achromatic telescope, the two
lenses are usually both plano-convex, and fixed with their curved
faces towards the object glass, as in the figure. Sometimes, however,
they consist of what is called _crossed_ lenses, that is lenses ground
on one side to a short focus, and on the other side to a pretty
long focus, the sides with the deepest curves being turned towards
the object glass. A diaphragm, or aperture of a proper diameter, is
placed at the focus of the eye lens, where the image formed by the
object-glass falls, for the purpose of cutting off the extreme rays of
the field lens, and rendering every part of the field of view equally
distinct. This is likewise the form of the eye-piece generally applied
to Gregorian reflectors. In short, when accurately constructed, it is
applicable to telescopes of every description. This eye-piece, having
the image viewed, by the eye behind the inner lens, is generally called
the _negative_ eye-piece, and is that which the optical-instrument
makers usually supply, of three or four different sizes, for so many
magnifying powers, to be applied to different celestial objects,
according to their nature or the state of the atmosphere in which they
are used.

_Ramsden’s eye-piece._--There is another modification of lenses,
known by the name of the _Positive_, or Ramsden’s eye-piece, which is
much used in Transit instruments, and telescopes which are furnished
with micrometers, and which affords equally good vision as the other
eye-piece. In this construction the lenses are plano-convex, and
nearly of the same focus, but are placed at a distance from each other
less than the focal distance of the glass next the eye, so that the
image of the object viewed is beyond both the lenses, when measuring
from the eye. The flat faces of the two lenses are turned into
contrary directions in this eye-piece--one facing the object-glass,
and the other the eye of the observer; and as the image formed at
the focus of the object-glass, lies parallel to the flat face of the
contiguous lens, every part of the field of view is distinct at the
same adjustment, or, as opticians say, there is a _flat field_, which,
without a diaphragm, prevents distortion of the object. This eye-piece
is represented in fig. 74, where AB and CD are two plano-convex
lenses, with their convex sides inwards. They have nearly the same
focal length, and are placed at a distance from each other, equal to
about two thirds of the focal length of either. The focal length of
an equivalent single lens is equal to three fourths the focal length
of either lens, supposing them to have equal focal distances. This
eye-piece is generally applied, when wires of spider’s lines are used
in the common focus; as the piece containing the lenses can be taken
out without disturbing the lines, and is adjustable for distinct
vision; and whatever may be the measure of any object given by the
wire micrometer, at the solar focus, it is not altered by a change of
the magnifying power, when a second eye-piece of this construction is
substituted.

[Illustration: _figure 75._]

[Illustration: _figure 76._]

_Aberration of lenses._--In connection with the above descriptions,
the following statements respecting the spherical aberration of lenses
may not be inappropriate. Mr. John Dollond, in a letter to Mr. Short,
remarks, that ‘the aberration in a single lens is as the cube of the
refracted angle; but if the refraction be caused by two lenses, the sum
of the cubes of each half will be 1/4 of the refracted angle, twice
the cube of 1 being 1/4 the cube of 2. So three times the cube of 1 is
only _one ninth_ of the cube of 3.’ &c. Hence the indistinctness of the
borders of the field of view of a telescope is diminished by increasing
the number of lenses in an eye piece. Sir J. Herschel has shown that if
two plano-convex lenses are put together as in fig. 75, the aberration
will be only 0.2481, or _one fourth_ of that of a single lens in its
best form. The focal length of the first of these lenses, must be to
that of the second as 1 to 2.3. If their focal lengths are equal, the
aberration will be 0.603, or nearly one half. The spherical aberration,
however, may be _entirely_ destroyed by combining a meniscus and double
convex lens, as shown in fig. 76, the convex sides being turned to the
eye when they are used as lenses, and to parallel rays, when they are
used as burning glasses. Sir J. Herschel has computed the following
curvatures for such lenses.

  _Focal length of the convex lens_    +10.000
  Radius of its first surface           +5.833
  Radius of its second surface         -35.000
  _Focal length of the meniscus_       +17.829
  Radius of its first surface           +3.688
  Radius of its second surface          +6.294
  Focal length of the compound lens     +6.407

On the general principles above stated, a good astronomical eye-piece
may be easily constructed with two proper lenses, either according to
the plan of Huygens or that of Ramsden; and, from what has been now
stated it is demonstrably certain, that, in all cases where two glasses
are properly combined, such an eye-piece is superior to a single lens,
both in point of distinctness, and of the enlargement of the field of
view. I lately fitted up an eye-piece, on Ramsden’s principle, with
two lenses, each about 3 inches focal length, and 1-3/8 inch diameter,
placed at half an inch distant, with their convex surfaces facing
each other as in fig. 74, which forms an excellent eye-piece for an
achromatic telescope, 6 feet 8 inches focal distance, and 4 inches
aperture, particularly for viewing clusters of stars, the Milky Way,
and the large nebulæ. The field of view is large, the magnifying power
is only between 50 and 60 times, and the quantity of light being so
great, every celestial object appears with great brilliancy, and it is
in general much preferable, when applied to the stars than any of the
higher powers. When applied to _Presepe_ in Cancer, it exhibits that
group at one view, as consisting of nearly a 100 stars which exhibit a
beautiful and most striking appearance.

It may appear a curious circumstance that any eye-piece which is good
with a short telescope, is also good with a long one, but that the
reverse is not true; for it is found to be more difficult to make
a good eye-piece for a short than for a long focal distance of the
object-glass.

Celestial eye-pieces are sometimes constructed so as to produce
_variable powers_. This is effected by giving a motion to the lens next
the eye, so as to remove it nearer to or farther from the field lens;
for at every different distance at which it is placed from the other
lens, the magnifying power will either be increased or diminished. The
greatest power is when the two lenses are nearly in contact, and the
power diminishes in proportion to the distance at which the glass next
the eye is removed from the other. The scale of distance, however,
between the two lenses, cannot be greater than the focal distance of
the field, or inner glass; for if it were, the lenses would no longer
form an eye-piece, but would be changed into an inverting opera-glass.
For effecting the purpose now stated, the eye-glass is fixed in a
tube which slides upon an interior tube on which is marked a scale of
distances, corresponding to certain magnifying powers; and, in this way
an eye-piece may be made to magnify about double the number of times,
when the lenses are in one position than when they are in another--as,
for example, all the powers from 36 to 72 times may be thus applied,
merely by regulating the distance between the two lenses. When the
glasses are varied in this manner the eye-piece becomes sometimes a
_positive_ eye-piece, like Ramsden’s, and sometimes a negative one like
that of Huygens.

_Diagonal eye-pieces._ The eye-pieces to which we have now adverted,
when adapted to refracting telescopes, both reverse and invert the
object, and therefore are not calculated for showing terrestrial
objects in their natural position. But as the heavenly bodies are of a
spherical form, this circumstance detracts nothing from their utility.
When the celestial object, however, is at a high altitude, the observer
is obliged to place his head in a very inconvenient position, and to
direct his eye nearly upwards; in which position he cannot remain long
at ease, or observe with a steady eye. To remedy this inconvenience,
the diagonal eye-piece has been invented, which admits of the eye
being applied at the side--or at the upper part of the eye-piece,
instead of the end; and when such an eye-piece is used, it is of no
importance in what direction the telescope is elevated, as the observer
can then either sit or stand erect, and look down upon the object with
the utmost ease. This object is effected by placing a flat piece of
polished speculum-metal at an angle of 45 degrees in respect to the two
lenses of the eye-piece, which alters the direction of the converging
rays, and forms an image which becomes erect with respect to altitude,
but is reversed with respect to azimuth;--that is, in other words,
when we look down upon the objects in the field of view, they appear
erect; but that part of an object which is in reality on our right hand
appears on our left; and if it be in motion, its _apparent_ is opposite
to its _real_ motion; if it be moving towards the west, it will seem to
move towards the east.

There are three situations in which the diagonal reflector in this
eye-piece may be placed. It may be placed either 1. before the
eye-piece,--or 2. behind it,--or 3. between the two lenses of which
the eye-piece consists. The most common position of the reflector is
between the lenses; and this may be done both in the negative and the
positive eye-pieces; but as the distance between the two lenses is
necessarily considerable, to make room for the diagonal position of the
reflector, the magnifying power cannot be great; otherwise, a diagonal
eye-piece of this construction remains always in adjustment, and is
useful in all cases where a high power is not required. The following
is a description and representation of a diagonal eye-piece of this
kind in my possession.

[Illustration: _figure 77._]

In fig. 77, AB represents the plano-convex lens next the object, which
is about 2 inches in focal length, and 3/4 inch in diameter; CD, a
plain metallic speculum of an oval form, well polished, and placed at
half a right angle to the axis of the tube; and EF another plano-convex
lens, about 1-1/2 inch focal distance. The centre of the speculum is
about 1-1/4 inch from the lens AB, and about 1/2 or 1/3 inch from EF;
so that this eye-piece is a _positive_ one, on the principle proposed
by Ramsden. The rays proceeding from the lens AB, and falling upon the
speculum, are reflected in a perpendicular direction to the lens EF,
where they enter the eye at G, which looks down upon the object through
the side of the tube. The real size of this eye-piece is much about the
same as that represented in the figure. When applied to an achromatic
telescope of 44-1/2 inches focal distance it produces a magnifying
power of 36 times, and exhibits a very beautiful view of the whole
of the full moon. It likewise presents a very pleasing prospect of
terrestrial objects, which appear as if situated immediately below us.

[Illustration: _figure 78._]

Another plan of the diagonal eye-piece is represented in fig. 78, where
the speculum is fixed _within_ the sliding tube which receives the
eye-piece, or immediately below it. The part of the tube at AB slides
into the tube of the telescope, CD is the speculum placed at half a
right angle to the axis of the tube, and EF, the tube containing the
lenses, which stands at right angles to the position of the telescope,
and slides into an exterior tube, and the eye is applied at G. This
construction of the diagonal eye-piece may be used with any eye-piece
whatever, whether the Huygenian or that of Ramsden. It will admit of
any magnifying power, and if several different eye-pieces be fitted
to the sliding tube, they may be changed at pleasure. This form of
the diagonal eye-piece, I therefore consider as the best and the
most convenient construction, although it is not commonly adopted by
opticians.

When any of these eye-pieces are applied to a telescope, with the lens
E on the upper part of it, we look down upon the object, if it be a
terrestrial one, as if it were under our feet. If we turn the eye-piece
round in its socket a quarter of a circle towards the left, an object
directly before us in the south, will appear as if it were in the
_west_ and turned upside down. If, from this position, it is turned
round a semicircle towards the right, and the eye applied, the same
object will appear as if it were situated in the east, and inverted;
and if it be turned round another quadrant, till it be directly
opposite to its first position, and the eye applied from below, the
object or landscape will appear as if suspended in the atmosphere above
us. This eye-piece, therefore, is capable of exhibiting objects in a
great variety of aspects, and the use of it is both pleasant and easy
for the observer. But there is a considerable loss of light, occasioned
by the reflection from the speculum, which is sensibly felt when very
high powers are applied; and therefore when very small stars are to be
observed, such as some of those connected with double or triple stars,
the observer should not study his own ease so much as the quantity of
light he can retain with a high power, which object is best attained
with an ordinary eye-piece and a telescope of large aperture.

We have said that a diagonal eye-piece may be constructed with a
reflector _before_ the eye-piece. In this case, the speculum is
sometimes made to slide before the eye at the requisite angle of
reclination, in which application each eye-piece must necessarily have
a groove to receive it, and the eye must be applied without a hole
to direct it, but it may be put on and taken off without disturbing
the adjustment for distinct vision, and is very simple in its
application. But, on the whole, the form represented in fig. 78, is
the most convenient, and should generally be preferred, as any common
astronomical eye-piece can be applied to it. I have used a diagonal
eye-piece of this kind, with good effect, when a power of 180 has been
applied to the sun and other celestial objects.

Instead of a metallic speculum, a _rectangular prism of glass_
is sometimes substituted; for the rays of light are then bent by
reflection from the second polished surface, which ought to be _dry_,
and undergo two refractions which achromatise them; and the same effect
is thus produced as by polished metal. Ramsden sometimes gave one of
the polished faces of a right angled prism a curve, which prism served
instead of a lens in an eye-piece, and also performed the office of a
reflector. A semi-globe, or what has been called a Bull’s eye, has also
been used as a diagonal eye-piece, and when the curve is well-formed,
and the glass good, it is achromatic, and is said to perform pretty
well, but it is not superior to the forms already described.


SECT. 2.--TERRESTRIAL EYE-PIECES.

When describing the common refracting telescope, (p. 228.) I have
noticed that three eye-glasses, placed at double their focal distances
from each other, formerly constituted the terrestrial eye-piece,
as represented in fig. 47. But this construction, especially for
achromatic instruments, has now become obsolete, and is never used,
except in small pocket spy-glasses formed with a single object lens. In
its place a four glassed eye-piece has been substituted, which is now
universally used in all good telescopes, and which, besides improving
the vision and producing an erect position of the images of objects,
presents a considerably larger field of view. During the progressive
stages of improvement made in the construction of erect eye-pieces by
Dollond and Ramsden, three, four, and five lenses were successively
introduced; and hence, in some of the old telescopes constructed by
these artists, we frequently find five lenses of different descriptions
composing the eye-piece. But four lenses, arranged in the manner I
am now about to describe, have ultimately obtained the preference.
In a telescope having a celestial eye-piece of the Huygenian form,
the image that is formed in the focus of the object glass, is that
which is seen magnified, and in an inverted position; but when a four
glassed eye-piece is used, which produces an erect view of the object,
the image is repeated, and the _second_ image, which is formed by
the inner pair of lenses AB on an enlarged scale, is that which the
pair of lenses CD at the eye-end render visible on a scale still more
enlarged. The modern terrestrial eye-piece, represented in fig. 79,
is, in fact, nothing else than a compound microscope, consisting of an
object lens, an amplifying lens, and an eye-piece composed of a pair
of lenses on the principle of the Huygenian eye-piece. Its properties
will be best understood by considering the first image of an object,
which is formed in the focus of the object glass, as a small luminous
object to be rendered visible, in a magnified state, by a compound
microscope. The object to be magnified may be considered as placed near
the point A, and the magnified image at _i_, which is viewed by the
lens D. Hence, if we look through such an eye-piece at a small object
placed very near the lens A, we shall find that it acts as a compound
microscope of a moderate magnifying power increasing, in some cases,
the diameter of the object about 10 times, and 100 times in surface.

[Illustration: _figure 79._]

In order to distinguish the different lenses in this eye-piece, we may
call the lens A, which is next to the first image, the _object-lens_,
the next to it B, the _amplifying-lens_, the third, or C, the
_field-lens_, and the one next the eye, D, the _eye-lens_. The first
image formed a little before A, may be denominated the _radiant_, or
the object from which the rays proceed. Now, it is well known as a
principle in optics, that if the radiant be brought nearer to the lens
than its principal focus, the emerging rays will _diverge_, and, on
the contrary, if the radiant be put farther from the lens than its
principal focal distance, the emerging rays will _converge_ to a point
at a distance beyond the lens, which will depend on the distance of the
radiant from the first face of the lens. In this place an image of the
radiant will be formed by the concurrence of the converging rays, but
in a contrary position; and the length of the image will exceed the
length of the radiant in the same proportion, as the distance of the
image from the radiant exceeds that of the radiant from the lens. This
secondary image of the radiant at _i_, is not well-defined, when only
one lens, as A, is used, owing to the great spherical aberrations, and
therefore the amplifying lens is placed at the distance of the shorter
conjugate focus, with an intervening diaphragm of a small diameter at
the place of the principal focus; the uses of which lens and diaphragm
are, first to cut off the coloured rays that are occasioned by the
dispersive property of the object lens,--and secondly, to bring the
rays to a shorter conjugate focus for the place of the image, than
would have taken place with a single lens having only one refraction.
As the secondary image is in this way much better defined and free from
colouration, the addition of this second lens is a great improvement to
vision. For this reason I am clearly of opinion, that the object glass
of a compound microscope, instead of consisting of a small single lens,
should be formed of two lenses on the principle now stated, which would
unquestionably add to the distinctness of vision.

With respect to _the proportions of the focal lengths of the lenses_
in this four glass eye-piece, Mr. Coddington states, that if the focal
lengths, reckoning from A to D, fig. 79, be as the numbers 3, 4, 4 and
3, and the distances between them on the same scale, 4, 6, and 5, 2,
the radii, reckoning from the outer surface of A, should be thus:--

  A {First surface  27 }nearly plano-convex.
    {Second surface  1 }

  B {First surface   9 }a miniscus.
    {Second surface  4 }

  C {First surface    1 }nearly plano-convex.
    {Second surface  21 }

  D {First surface    1 }double convex.
    {Second surface  24 }

Sir D. Brewster states, that a good achromatic eye-piece may be made of
4 lenses, if their focal lengths, reckoning from that next the object,
be as the numbers 14, 21, 27, 32; their distances 23, 44, 40; their
apertures 5.6; 3.4; 13.5; 2.6; and the aperture of the diaphragm placed
in the interior focus of the fourth eye-glass, 7. Another proportion
may be stated:--Suppose the lens next the object A, to be 1-7/8 inch
focal length, then B may be 2-1/2 inches, C 2 inches, and D 1-1/2; and
their distances AB 2-1/2; BC 3-5/8; and CD 2-3/8. In one of Ramsden’s
small telescopes, whose object glass was 8-1/2 inches in focal length,
and its magnifying power 15.4, the focal lengths of the eye glasses
were A 0.775 of an inch, B 1.025, C 1.01, D 0.79;--the distances AB
1.18, BC 1.83, and CD 1.105. In the excellent achromatic telescope
of Dollond’s construction which belonged to the Duc de Chaulnes, the
focal lengths of the eye glasses, beginning with that next the object,
were 14-1/4 lines, 19, 22-3/4, 14; their distances 22.48 lines, 46.17,
21.45, and their thickness at the centre, 1.23 lines, 1.25, 1.47. The
fourth lens was plano-convex, with the plane side to the eye, and the
rest were double convex lenses. This telescope was in focal length 3
feet 5-1/2 inches.

The magnifying power of this eye-piece, as usually made, differs only
in a small degree from what would be produced by using the first or
the fourth glass alone, in which case the magnifying power would be
somewhat greater, but the vision less distinct, and were the lens next
the eye used alone without the field glass, the field of view would
be much contracted. Stops should be placed between the lenses A and B,
near to B, and a larger one between C and D, to prevent any false light
from passing through the lenses to the eye. The more stops that are
introduced into a telescope--which should all be blackened--provided
they do not hinder the pencils of light proceeding from the object, the
better will the instrument perform.

For the information of amateur constructors of telescopes, I shall
here state the dimensions of two or three four glassed eye-pieces in
my possession, which perform with great distinctness, and present a
pretty large field of view. In one of these, adapted to a 44-1/2 inch
achromatic, the lens A, next the object, is 1-7/8 inch, focal length,
and about 1 inch diameter, with the plane side, next the object. The
focal length of the lens B 2-1/10 inches, diameter 7/10 inch, with its
plane side next A; distance of these lenses from each other 2-4/10
inches. Distance of the field lens C from the lens B 5-1/2 inches. The
small hole or diaphragm between A and B is at the focus of A, and is
about 1/6 inch diameter, and about 3/8 of an inch from the lens B. The
field lens C is 2 inches focal length, and 1-1/4 inch diameter, with
its plane side next the eye. The lens next the eye D is 1 inch focal
distance, 1/2 inch diameter, and is distant from the field glass 1-3/4
inch, with its plane side next the eye. The magnifying power of this
eye-piece is equivalent to that of a single lens whose focal length is
half an inch, and with the 44-1/2 inch object glass produces a power of
about 90 times. The lens next the eye can be changed for another 1-3/8
inch focal length, which produces a power of 65; and the two glasses
CD can be changed for another set, of a longer focal distance which
produces a power of 45 times. The whole length of this eye-piece is
11-1/2 inches.

In another eye-piece, adapted to a pocket achromatic, whose object
glass is 9 inches focal length, the lens A is 1 inch focal length,
and 1/2 inch diameter; the lens B 1-1/4 inch, and 1/2 inch diameter,
their distance 1-1/2 inch, the lens C 1-1/10 inch focal length, and
5/8 inch diameter; the eye-lens D 5/8 inch focal length, and 3/8 inch
diameter; distance between C and D 1-1/8 inch. The distance between B
and C 1-3/4 inch. The whole length of this eye-piece is 4-1/2 inches,
and its power is nearly equal to that of a single lens of 1/2 or 6/10
of an inch focal length, the magnifying power of the telescope being
about 16 times. Another eye-piece of much larger dimensions, has the
lens A of 2-1/2 inches focal length, and 3/4 inch diameter: the lens
B 2-3/4 inches focus and 5/8 inch diameter; and their distance 2-3/4
inches; the lens C 2-5/8 inches focus and 1-1/8 inch diameter; the lens
D 1-3/4 inch focus and 3/4 inch diameter; distance from each other
2-3/4 inches. The distance between the lenses B and C is 4 inches. The
magnifying power is equal to that of a single lens 1-1/8 inch focal
distance. When applied to an achromatic object glass 6 feet 7 inches
focal length, it produces a power of about 70 times. This eye-piece has
a moveable tube 9 inches in length in which the two lenses next the
eye are contained, by pulling out which, and consequently increasing
the distance between the lenses B and C, the magnifying power may be
increased to 100, 120 or 140, according to the distance to which this
moveable tube is drawn out. It has also a second and third set of
lenses, corresponding to C and D of a shorter focal distance, which
produce higher magnifying powers on a principle to be afterwards
explained.


_Description of an eye-piece, &c. of an old Dutch Achromatic Telescope._

About twenty or thirty years ago, I purchased, in an optician’s shop
in Edinburgh, a small achromatic telescope, made in Amsterdam, which
was supposed, by the optician, to have been constructed prior to the
invention of achromatic telescopes by Mr. Dollond. It is mounted wholly
of brass, and in all its parts is a piece of beautiful and exquisite
workmanship, and the utmost care seems to have been taken to have all
the glasses and diaphragms accurately adjusted. The object glass is a
double achromatic, 6-1/2 inches focal distance and 1 inch diameter,
but the clear aperture is only 7/8 inch diameter. It is perfectly
achromatic, and would bear a power of 50 times, if it had a sufficient
quantity of light. The following inscription is engraved on the tube
adjacent to the object glass:--“_Jan van Deyl en Zoon Invenit et
Fecit, Amsterdam, Ao. 1769_.” Although Dollond exhibited the principle
of an achromatic telescope, eight or ten years before the date here
specified, yet it is not improbable that the artist whose name is
here stated, may not have heard of Dollond’s invention; and that he
was really, as he assumes, one of the inventors of the achromatic
telescope. For, the invention of this telescope by Dollond was not very
generally known, except among philosophers and the London opticians,
till a number of years after the date above stated. Euler, in his
“Letters to a German Princess”--in which telescopes are particularly
described, makes no mention of, nor the least allusion to the invention
of Dollond, though this was a subject which particularly engaged his
attention. Now, these letters were written in 1762, but were not
published till 1770. When alluding to the defects in telescopes arising
from the different refrangibility of the rays of light, in Letter
43, and that they might possibly be rectified by means of different
transparent substances, he says, ‘But neither theory nor practice have
hitherto been carried to the degree of perfection necessary to the
execution of a structure which should remedy these defects.’ Mr. B.
Martin, in his ‘Gentleman and Lady’s Philosophy,’ published in 1781,
alludes to the achromatic telescope, but speaks of it as it were but
very little, if at all superior to the common refracting telescope. And
therefore, I think it highly probable that Jan van Deyl, was really an
inventor of an achromatic telescope, before he had any notice of what
Dollond and others had done in this way some short time before.

But my principal object in adverting to this telescope, is to describe
the structure of the eye-piece, which is a very fine one, and which
is somewhat different from the achromatic eye-piece above described.
It consists of four glasses, two combined next the eye, and two next
the object. Each of these combinations forms an astronomical eye-piece
nearly similar to the Huygenian. The lens A, next the object, fig. 80,
is 5/8 inch focal distance, and 4/10 inch diameter; the lens B 3/8 inch
focus, and 1/5 inch diameter, and the distance between them somewhat
less than 5/8 inch; the diameter of the aperture _e_ about 1/15 of an
inch. This combination forms an excellent astronomical eye-piece, with
a large flat field, and its magnifying power is equivalent to that of
a single lens 5/8 or 6/8 focal length. The lens C is 1/2 inch focal
length, and 4/10 inch diameter; the lens D 1/4 inch focus, and about
1/5 inch diameter; their distance about 1/2 inch, or a small fraction
more. The hole at _d_ is about 1/20 or 1/25 of an inch diameter, and
the distance between the lenses B and C about 1-1/2 inch. The whole
length of the eye-piece is 3-1/4 inches--exactly the same size as
represented in the engraving. Its magnifying power is equal to that of
a single lens 1/4 inch focal length; and consequently the telescope,
though only 9-1/2 inches long, magnifies 26 times, with great
distinctness, though there is a little deficiency of light when viewing
land objects, which are not well illuminated.

[Illustration: _figure 80._]

The glasses of this telescope are all plano-convex, with their
convex-sides towards the object--except the lens D, which is double
convex, but flattest on the side next the eye, and they are all very
accurately finished. The two lenses C and D form an astronomical
eye-piece nearly similar to that formed by the lenses A and B. The
focus of the telescope is adjusted by a screw, the threads of which are
formed upon the outside of a tube into which the eye-piece slides. The
eye-piece and apparatus connected with it, is screwed into the inside
of the main tube, when not in use, when the instrument forms a compact
brass cylinder 6 inches long, which is enclosed in a fish-skin case,
lined with silk velvet, which opens with hinges.

The lenses in the eye-pieces formerly described, though stated to be
plano-convexes, are for the most part _crossed glasses_, that is
ground on tools of a long focus on the one side, and to a short focus
on the other. The construction of the eye-piece of the Dutch telescope
above described, is one which might be adopted with a good effect
in most of our achromatic telescopes; and I am persuaded, from the
application I have made of it to various telescopes, that it is even
superior, in distinctness and accuracy, and in the _flatness of field_
which it produces to the eye-piece in common use. The two astronomical
eye-pieces of which it consists, when applied to large achromatic
telescopes, perform with great accuracy, and are excellently adapted
for celestial observations.


SECT. 3.--DESCRIPTION OF THE PANCRATIC EYE-TUBE.

From what we have stated, when describing the common terrestrial
eye-piece now applied to achromatic instruments, (p. 349, fig. 79.), it
appears obvious, that any variety of magnifying powers, within certain
limits, may be obtained by removing the set of lenses CD, fig. 79,
nearer to or farther from the tube which contains the lenses A and B,
on the same principle as the magnifying power of a compound microscope
is increased by removing the eye-glasses to a greater distance from
the object-lens. If then, the pair of eye-lenses CD be attached to an
inner tube that will draw out and increase their distance from the
inner pair of lenses, as the tube _a b c d_, the magnifying power may
be indefinitely increased or diminished, by pushing in or drawing out
the sliding tube, and a scale might be placed on this tube, which, if
divided into equal intervals, will be a scale of magnifying powers, by
which the power of the telescope will be seen at every division, when
the lowest power is once determined.

Sir David Brewster, in his ‘Treatise on New Philosophical instruments,’
Book i. chap. vii. page 59, published in 1813, has adverted to this
circumstance, in his description of an ‘Eye-piece wire micrometer,’ and
complains of Mr. Ezekiel Walker, having in the ‘Philosophical Magazine’
for August, 1811, described such an instrument as an invention of his
own. Dr. Kitchener some years afterwards, described what he called a
Pancratic or omnipotent eye-piece, and got one made by Dollond, with a
few modifications different from that suggested by Brewster and Walker,
which were little else than cutting the single tube into several parts,
and giving it the _appearance_ of a new invention. In fact, none of
these gentlemen had a right to claim it as his peculiar invention, as
the principle was known and recognised long before. I had increased the
magnifying powers of telescopes, on the same principle, several years
before any of these gentlemen communicated their views on the subject,
although I never formally constructed a scale of powers. Mr. B. Martin,
who died in 1782, proposed many years before, such a moveable interior
tube as that alluded to, for varying the magnifying power.

In order to give the reader a more specific idea of this contrivance,
I shall present him with a figure and description of one of Dr.
Kitchener’s Pancratic eye-pieces, copied from one lately in my
possession. The following are the exact dimensions of this instrument,
with the focal distances, &c. of the glasses, &c. of which it is
composed.

[Illustration: _fig. 81._]

  times, which is the smallest power. When the
  inner tube is drawn out 1/3 of an inch, or to
  the first division, the power is 110, &c.

From the figure and description, the reader will be at no loss to
perceive how the magnifying power is ascertained by this eye-piece.
If the lowest power for a 44 inch telescope be found to be 100, when
the three sliding tubes are shut into the larger one, then by drawing
out the tube next the eye 4 divisions, a power of 140 is produced; by
drawing out the tube next the eye its whole length, and the second
tube to the division marked 220, a power of 220 times is produced, and
drawing out all the tubes to their utmost extent, as represented in
the figure, a power of 400 is obtained. These powers are by far too
high for such a telescope, as the powers between 300 and 400 can seldom
or never be used. Were the scale to begin at 50, and terminate at
200, it would be much better adapted to a 3-1/2 feet telescope. Each
alteration of the magnifying power requires a new adjustment of the
eye-piece for distinct vision. As the magnifying power is increased,
the distance between the eye-glass and the object-glass must be
diminished. Dr. Kitchener says, that ‘the pancratic eye tube gives a
better defined image of a fixed star, and shows double stars decidedly
more distinct and perfectly separated than any other eye tube, and
that such tubes will probably enable us to determine the distances
of these objects from each other, in a more perfect manner than has
been possible heretofore.’ These tubes are made by Dollond, London,
and are sold for two guineas each. But I do not think they excel, in
distinctness, those which are occasionally made by Mr. Tulley and other
opticians.




CHAPTER VI.


MISCELLANEOUS REMARKS IN RELATION TO TELESCOPES.

The following remarks, chiefly in regard to the manner of using
telescopes, may perhaps be useful to young observers, who are not much
accustomed to the mode of managing these instruments.

1. _Adjustments requisite to be attended to in the use of telescopes._
When near objects are viewed with a considerable magnifying power, the
eye-tube requires to be removed farther from the object-glass than
when very distant objects are contemplated. When the telescope is
adjusted for an object, 6, 8, or 10 miles distant, a very considerable
alteration in the adjustment is requisite in order to see distinctly
an object at the distance of two or three hundred yards, especially if
the instrument is furnished with a high magnifying power. In this last
case, the eye-tube requires to be drawn out to a considerable distance
beyond the focus for parallel rays. I have found that, in a telescope
which magnifies 70 times, when adjusted for an object at the distance
of two miles, the adjustment requires to be altered fully one inch in
order to perceive distinctly an object at the distance of two or three
hundred yards; that is, the tube must be drawn, in this case, an inch
farther from the object-glass, and pushed in the same extent, when we
wish to view an object at the distance of two or three miles. These
adjustments are made, in pocket perspectives, by gently sliding the
eye-tube in or out, by giving it a gentle circular or spiral motion
till the object appear distinct. In using telescopes which are held
in the hand, the best plan is to draw all the tubes out to their full
length, and then, looking at the object, with the left hand supporting
the main tube near the object-glass, and the right supporting the
eye-tube--gently and gradually push in the eye-piece till distinct
vision be obtained. In Gregorian reflecting telescopes this adjustment
is made by means of a screw connected with the small speculum; and in
large achromatics, by means of a rack and pinion connected with the
eye-tube. When the magnifying power of a telescope is comparatively
small, the eye-tube requires to be altered only a very little.

There is another adjustment requisite to be attended to, in order to
adapt the telescope to the eyes of different persons. Those whose eyes
are too convex, or who are short-sighted, require the eye-tube to be
pushed in, and those whose eyes are somewhat flattened, as old people,
require the tube to be drawn out. Indeed there are scarcely two persons
whose eyes do not require different adjustments in a slight degree.
In some cases I have found that the difference of adjustment for two
individuals, in order to produce distinct vision in each, amounted
to nearly half an inch. Hence the difficulty of exhibiting the sun,
moon, and planets through telescopes, and even terrestrial objects,
to a company of persons who are unacquainted with the mode of using
or adjusting such instruments--not one half of whom generally see
the object distinctly--for, upon the proper adjustment of a telescope
to the eye, the accuracy of vision, in all cases, depends; and no one
except the individual actually looking through the instrument, can
be certain that it is accurately adjusted to his eye, and even the
individual himself, from not being accustomed to the view of certain
objects, may be uncertain whether or not the adjustment be correct. I
have found by experience that when the magnifying powers are high, as
150 or 200, the difference of adjustment required for different eyes
is very slight; but when low powers are used, as 20, 30, or 40, the
difference of the requisite adjustments is sometimes very considerable,
amounting to 1/4 or 1/2 of an inch.

2. _State of the Atmosphere most proper for observing terrestrial
and celestial objects._ The atmosphere which is thrown around the
globe--while it is essentially requisite to the physical constitution
of our world, and the comfort of its inhabitants--is found in
many instances a serious obstruction to the accurate performance
of telescopes. Sometimes it is obscured by mists and exhalations,
sometimes it is thrown into violent undulations by the heat of the
sun and the process of evaporation, and even, in certain cases, where
there appears a pure unclouded azure, there is an agitation among its
particles and the substances incorporated with them, which prevents
the telescope from producing distinct vision either of terrestrial or
celestial objects. For viewing distant terrestrial objects, especially
with high powers, the best time is early in the morning, a little
after sun-rise, and, from that period till about 9 o’clock A.M., in
summer; and, in the evening about two or three hours before sun-set.
From about 10 o’clock A.M. till 4 or 5 in the afternoon, in
summer, if the sky be clear and the sun shining, there is generally
a considerable undulation in the atmosphere, occasioned by the solar
rays and the rapid evaporation, which prevents high powers from being
used with distinctness on any telescope, however excellent. The objects
at such times, when powers of 50, 70, or 100 are applied, appear to
undulate like the waves of the sea, and, notwithstanding every effort
to adjust the telescope, they appear confused and indistinct. Even
with very moderate magnifying powers this imperfection is perceptible.
In such circumstances, I have sometimes used a power of 200 times
on distant land objects, with good effect, a little before sun-set,
when, in the forenoon of the same day, I could not have applied a
power of 50 with any degree of distinctness. On days when the air is
clear, and the atmosphere covered with clouds, terrestrial objects
may be viewed with considerably high powers. When there has been a
long-continued drought, the atmosphere is then in a very unfit state
for enjoying distinct vision with high magnifying powers, on account of
the quantity of vapours with which the atmosphere is then surcharged,
and the undulations they produce. But, after copious showers of rain,
especially if accompanied with high winds, the air is purified, and
distant objects appear with greater brilliancy and distinctness than at
any other seasons. In using telescopes, the objects at which we look
should, if possible, be nearly in a direction opposite to that of the
sun. When they are viewed nearly in the direction of the sun, their
shadows are turned towards us, and they consequently appear dim and
obscure. By not attending to this circumstance, some persons, in trying
telescopes, have pronounced a good instrument to be imperfect, which,
had it been tried on objects properly illuminated, would have been
found to be excellent. In our variable northerly climate the atmosphere
is not so clear and serene for telescopic observation as in Italy,
the South of France, and in many of the countries which lie within
the tropics. The undulations of the air, owing to the causes alluded
to above, constitute one of the principal reasons why a telescope
magnifying above a hundred times can seldom be used with any good
effect in viewing terrestrial objects--though I have sometimes used a
power of nearly 200 with considerable distinctness, in the stillness
of a summer or autumnal evening, when the rays of the declining sun
strongly illuminated distant objects.

The atmosphere is likewise frequently a great obstruction to the
distinct perception of _celestial_ objects. It is scarcely possible for
one who has not been accustomed to astronomical observations, to form
a conception of the very great difference there is in the appearance
of some of the heavenly bodies in different states of the atmosphere.
There are certain conditions of the atmosphere essentially requisite
for making accurate observations with powerful telescopes, and it
is but seldom, especially in our climate, that all the favourable
circumstances concur. The nights must be very clear and serene--the
moon absent--no twilight--no haziness--no violent wind--no sudden
change of temperature, as from thaw to frost--and no surcharge of the
atmosphere with aqueous vapour. I have frequently found that, on the
first and second nights after a thaw, when a strong frost had set in,
and when the heavens appeared very brilliant, and the stars vivid
and sparkling--the planets, when viewed with high powers, appeared
remarkably undefined and indistinct; their margins appeared waving and
jagged, and the belts of Jupiter, which at other times were remarkably
distinct, were so obscured and ill-defined, that they could with
difficulty be traced. This is probably owing to the quantity of aqueous
vapour, and perhaps icy particles, then floating in the air, and to
the undulations thereby produced. When a hard frost has continued a
considerable time, this impediment to distinct observation is in a
great measure removed. But I have never enjoyed more accurate and
distinct views of the heavenly bodies than in fresh serene evenings,
when there was no frost and no wind, and only a few fleecy clouds
occasionally hovering around. On such evenings, and on such alone, the
highest powers may be applied. I have used magnifying powers on such
occasions with good effect, which could not have been applied, so as to
ensure distinct vision, more frequently than two or three days in the
course of a year.

Sir William Herschel has observed, in reference to this point, ‘In
beautiful nights, when the outside of our telescopes is dropping with
moisture, discharged from the atmosphere, there are now and then
favourable _hours_ in which it is hardly possible to put a limit to
the magnifying powers. But such valuable opportunities are extremely
scarce, and with large instruments it will always be lost labour to
observe at other times. In order therefore, to calculate how long a
time it must take to sweep the heavens, as far as they are within
the reach of my forty-feet telescope, charged with a magnifying
power of 1000, I have had recourse to my journals to find how many
favourable hours we may annually hope for in this climate. And, under
all favourable circumstances, it appears, that a year which will
afford ninety, or at most, one hundred _hours_ is to be called very
productive.’ ‘In the equator, with my twenty feet telescope, I have
swept over zones of two degrees with a power of 157, but an allowance
of ten minutes in Polar distance must be made for lapping the sweeps
over one another where they join. As the breadth of the zones may be
increased towards the poles, the northern hemisphere may be swept in
about 40 zones; to these we must add 19 southern zones; then 59 zones
which, on account of the sweeps lapping over one another, about 5
minutes of time in right ascension, we must reckon of 25 hours each,
will give 1475 hours. And allowing 100 hours per year, we find that
with the 20 feet telescope, the heavens may be swept in about 14 years
and three quarters. Now the time of sweeping with different magnifying
powers will be as the squares of the powers; and putting _p_ and _t_
for the power and time in the 20 feet telescope, and P = 1000 for
the power in the 40 feet instrument, we shall have p^2 : t :: P^2 :
^{tP2}/_{p^2} = 59840. Then making the same allowance for 100 hours per
year, it appears that it will require not less than 598 years, to look
with the 40 feet reflector, charged with the above-mentioned power,
only one single moment into each point of space; and even then, so much
of the southern hemisphere will remain unexplored, as will take up 213
years more to examine.’[28]

From the above remarks of so eminent an observer, the reader will
perceive how difficult it is to explore the heavens with minuteness and
accuracy, and with how many disappointments, arising from the state
of the atmosphere, the astronomer must lay his account, when employed
in planetary or sidereal investigation. Besides the circumstances now
stated, it ought to be noticed that a star or a planet is only in
a situation for a high magnifying power, about half the time it is
above the horizon. The density of the atmosphere, and the quantity of
vapours with which it is charged near the horizon, prevent distinct
vision of celestial objects with high powers, till they have risen to
at least 15 or 20 degrees in altitude, and the highest magnifiers can
scarcely be applied with good effect, unless the object is near the
meridian, and at a considerable elevation above the horizon. If the
moon be viewed a little after her rising, and afterwards when she comes
to her highest elevation in autumn, the difference in her appearance
and distinctness will be strikingly perceptible. It is impossible to
guess whether a night be well adapted for celestial observations,
till we actually make the experiment, and instruments are frequently
condemned, when tried at improper seasons, when the atmosphere only is
in fault. A certain observer remarks,--‘I have never seen the face of
Saturn more distinctly than in a night when the air has been so hazy,
that with my naked eye, I could hardly discern a star of less than the
third magnitude.’ The degree of the transparency of the air is likewise
varying almost in the course of every minute, so that even in the
course of the same half hour, planets and stars will appear perfectly
defined, and the reverse. The vapours moving and undulating the
atmosphere, even when the sky appears clear to the naked eye, will in a
few instants destroy the distinctness of vision, and in a few seconds
more, the object will resume its clear and well-defined aspect.[29]

3. _On the magnifying powers requisite for observing the phenomena of
the different planets--comets--double stars, &c._

There are some objects connected with astronomy which cannot be
perceived without having recourse to instruments and to powers of
great magnitude. But it is a vulgar error to imagine that very large
and very expensive telescopes are absolutely necessary for viewing
the greater part of the more interesting scenery of the heavens. Most
of the phenomena of the planets, comets and double stars and other
objects, are visible with instruments of moderate dimensions, so that
every one who has a relish for celestial investigations, may, at a
comparatively small expense, procure a telescope, for occasional
observations, which will show the principal objects and phenomena
described in books on astronomy. Many persons have been misled by some
occasional remarks which Sir W. Herschel made, in reference to certain
very high powers which he sometimes put, by way of experiment, on some
of his telescopes, as if these were the powers requisite for viewing
the objects to which he refers. For example, it is stated that he once
put a power of 6450 times on his 7 feet Newtonian telescope of 6-3/10
inches aperture; but this was only for the purpose of an experiment,
and could be of no use whatever when applied to the moon, the planets
and most objects in the heavens. Herschel, through the whole course of
his writings, mentions his only having used it _twice_, namely on the
stars α Lyræ, and γ Leonis, which stars can be seen more distinctly and
sharply defined with a power of 420. To produce a power of 6450 on such
a telescope, would require a lens of only 1/77th of an inch in focal
distance, and it is questioned by some whether Herschel had lenses of
so small a size in his possession, or whether it is possible to form
them with accuracy.

_Powers requisite for observing the phenomena of the planets._--The
planet Mercury requires a considerable magnifying power, in order to
perceive its phases with distinctness. I have seldom viewed this planet
with a less power than 100 and 150, with which powers its half moon,
its gibbous, and its crescent phase, may be distinctly perceived. With
a power of 40, 50, or even 60 times, these phases can with difficulty
be seen, especially as it is generally at a low altitude, when such
observations are made. The phases of _Venus_ are much more easily
distinguished, especially the _crescent_ phase, which is seen to
the greatest advantage about a month before and after the inferior
conjunction. With a power not exceeding 25 or 30 times, this phase,
at such periods, may be easily perceived. It requires, however, much
higher powers to perceive distinctly the variations of the gibbous
phase; and if this planet be not viewed at a considerably high altitude
when in a half-moon or gibbous phase, the obscurity and undulations
of the atmosphere near the horizon, prevent such phases from being
accurately distinguished, even when high powers are applied. Although
certain phenomena of the planets may be seen with such low powers as
I have now stated, yet, in every instance, the highest magnifying
powers, consistent with distinctness, should be preferred, as the eye
is not then strained, and the object appears with a greater degree of
magnitude and splendour. The planet _Mars_ requires a considerable
degree of magnifying power, even when at its nearest distance from the
earth, in order to discern its spots and its gibbous phase. I have
never obtained a satisfactory view of the spots which mark the surface,
and their relative position, with a less power than 130, 160, or 200
times; and even with such powers, persons not much accustomed to look
through telescopes, find a difficulty in distinguishing them.

The strongest and most prominent _belts of Jupiter_, may be seen with
a power of about 45; which power may be put upon a 20-inch achromatic,
or a 1 foot reflector. But a satisfactory view of all the belts, and
the relative positions they occupy, cannot be obtained with much
lower powers than 80, 100, or 140. The most common positions of these
belts are--one dark and well-defined belt to the south of Jupiter’s
equator; another of nearly the same description to the north of it,
and one about his north and his south polar circles. These polar belts
are much more faint, and consequently not so easily distinguished as
the equatorial belts. The _moons_ of this planet, in a very clear
night, may sometimes be seen with a pocket 1 foot achromatic glass,
magnifying about 15 or 16 times. Some people have pretended that they
could see some of these satellites with their naked eye; but this is
very doubtful, and it is probable that such persons mistook certain
fixed stars which happened to be near Jupiter for his satellites. But,
in order to have a clear and interesting view of these, powers of at
least 80 or 100 times should be used. In order to perceive their
immersions into the shadow of Jupiter, and the exact moment of their
emersions from it, a telescope not less than a 44 inch achromatic, with
a power of 150 should be employed. When these satellites are viewed
through large telescopes with high magnifying powers, they appear
with well defined disks, like small planets. The planet Jupiter has
generally been considered as a good test by which to try telescopes
for celestial purposes. When it is near the meridian and at a high
altitude, if its general surface, its belts, and its margin appear
distinct and well-defined, it forms a strong presumptive evidence that
the instrument is a good one.

The planet _Saturn_ forms one of the most interesting objects for
telescopic observation. The _ring_ of Saturn may be _seen_ with a power
of 45; but it can only be contemplated with advantage when powers
of 100, 150, and 200 are applied to a 3 or a 5 feet achromatic. The
_belts of Saturn_ are not to be seen distinctly with an achromatic
of less than 2-3/4 inches aperture, or a Gregorian reflector of less
than 4 inches aperture, nor with a less magnifying power than 100
times. Sir W. Herschel has drawn this planet with five belts across
its disk; but it is seldom that above one or two of them can be seen
by moderate-sized telescopes and common observers. The _division_
of the double ring, when the planet is in a favorable position for
observation, and in a high altitude, may sometimes be perceived with
a 44-inch achromatic, with an aperture of 2-3/4 inches, and with
powers of 150 or 180, but higher powers and larger instruments are
generally requisite to perceive this phenomenon distinctly; and even
when a portion of it is seen at the extremities of the _ansæ_, the
division cannot, in every case, be traced along the whole of the
half-circumference of the ring which is presented to our eye. Mr.
Hadley’s engraving of Saturn, in the ‘Philosophical Transactions’
for 1723, though taken with a Newtonian reflector with a power of
228, represents the division of the ring as seen only on the ansæ or
extremities of the elliptic figure in which the ring appears. The
best period for observing this division is when the ring appears at
its utmost width. In this position it was seen in 1840, and it will
appear nearly in the same position in 1855. When the ring appears like
a very narrow ellipse, a short time previous to its disappearance, the
division, or dark space between the rings, cannot be seen by ordinary
instruments.

Sir W. Herschel very properly observes, ‘There is not perhaps another
object in the heavens that presents us with such a variety of
extraordinary phenomena as the planet Saturn; a magnificent globe,
encompassed by a stupendous double ring; attended by seven satellites;
ornamented with equatorial belts; compressed at the poles; turning upon
its axis; mutually eclipsing its ring and satellites, and eclipsed by
them; the most distant of the rings also turning upon its axis, and the
same taking place with the farthest of the satellites; all the parts
of the system of Saturn occasionally reflecting light on each other;
the rings and moons illuminating the nights of the Saturnian, the globe
and satellites enlightening the dark parts of the ring; and the planet
and rings throwing back the sun’s beams upon the moons, when they are
deprived of them at the time of their conjunctions.’ This illustrious
astronomer states, that with a new 7 feet mirror of extraordinary
distinctness he examined this planet, and found that the ring reflects
more light than the body, and with a power of 570 the colour of the
body becomes yellowish, while that of the ring remains more white. On
March 11, 1780, he tried the powers of 222, 332, and 440 successively,
and found the light of Saturn less intense than that of the ring; the
colour of the body turning, with the high powers, to a kind of yellow
white, while that of the ring still remained white.

Most of the _satellites_ of Saturn are difficult to be perceived
with ordinary telescopes, excepting the 4th, which may be seen with
powers of from 60 to 100 times. It was discovered by Huygens in 1655,
by means of a common refracting telescope 12 feet long, which might
magnify about 70 times. The next in brightness to this is the 5th
satellite, which Cassini discovered in 1671, by means of a 17 feet
refractor, which might carry a power of above 80 times. The 3rd was
discovered by the same astronomer in 1672, by a longer telescope; and
the 1st and 2nd, in 1684, by means of two excellent object-glasses of
100 and 136 feet, which might have magnified from 200 to 230 times.
They were afterwards seen by two other glasses of 70 and 90 feet, made
by Campani, and sent from Rome to the Royal Observatory at Paris, by
the King’s order, after the discovery of the 3rd and 5th satellites.
It is asserted, however, that all those 5 satellites were afterwards
seen with a telescope of 34 feet, with an aperture of 3-3/10 inches,
which would magnify about 120 times. These satellites, on the whole,
except the 4th and 5th, are not easily detected. Dr. Derham, who
frequently viewed Saturn through Huygens’ glass of 126 feet focal
length, declares, in the preface to his ‘Astro-Theology,’ that he could
never perceive above 3 of the satellites. Sir W. Herschel observes,
that the visibility of these minute and extremely faint objects,
depends more on the _penetrating_ than upon the _magnifying_ power
of our telescopes; and that with a 10 feet Newtonian, charged with
a magnifying power of only 60, he saw all the 5 old satellites; but
the 6th and 7th, which were discovered and were easily seen with his
40-feet telescope, and were also visible in his 20-feet instrument,
were not discernible in the 7 or the 10-feet telescopes, though all
that _magnifying power_ can do may be done as well with the 7-feet as
with any larger instrument. Speaking of the 7th satellite, he says,
‘Even in my 40-feet reflector it appears no bigger than a very small
lucid point. I see it, however, very well in the 20-feet reflector; to
which the exquisite figure of the speculum not a little contributes.’
A late observer asserts, that in 1825, with a 12-feet achromatic, of 7
inches aperture, made by Tulley, with a power of 150, the 7 satellites
were easily visible, but not so easily with a power of 200; and that
the planet appeared as bright as brilliantly burnished silver, and the
division in the ring and a belt were very plainly distinguished, with a
power of 200.

The planet _Uranus_, being generally invisible to the naked eye, is
seldom an object of attention to common observers. A considerable
magnifying power is requisite to make it appear in a planetary form
with a well-defined disk. The best periods for detecting it are, when
it is near its opposition to the sun, or when it happens to approximate
to any of the other planets, or to a well-known fixed star. When none
of these circumstances occur, its position requires to be pointed out
by an Equatorial Telescope. On the morning of the 25th January, 1841,
this planet happened to be in conjunction with Venus, at which time
it was only 4 minutes north of that planet. Several days before this
conjunction, I made observations on Uranus. On the evening of the
24th, about 8 hours before the conjunction, the two planets appeared
in the same field of the telescope, the one exceedingly splendid, and
the other more obscure, but distinct and well-defined. Uranus could
not be perceived, either with the naked eye, or with an opera glass;
but could be distinguished as a very small star by means of a pocket
achromatic telescope magnifying about 14 times. It is questionable
whether, under the most favourable circumstances, this planet can ever
be distinguished by the naked eye. With magnifying powers of 30 and 70,
it appeared as a moderately large star with a steady light, but without
any sensible disk. With powers of 120, 180, and 250, it presented a
round and pretty well-defined disk, but not so luminous and distinct as
it would have done in a higher altitude.

The _Double Stars_ require a great _variety_ of powers, in order to
distinguish the small stars that accompany the larger. Some of them
are distinguished with moderate powers, while others require pretty
large instruments, furnished with high magnifying eye-pieces. I shall
therefore select only a few as a specimen. The star _Castor_, or α
Geminorum, may be easily seen to be double with powers of from 70 to
100. I have sometimes seen these stars, which are nearly equal in size
and colour, with a terrestrial power of 44 on a 44-inch achromatic. The
appearance of this star with such powers is somewhat similar to that
of η Coronæ in a 7 feet achromatic, of 5 inches aperture, with a power
of 500. γ Andromedæ may be seen with a moderate power. In a 30-inch
achromatic of 2 inches aperture, and a power of 80, it appears like
ε Bootis, when seen in a 5-feet achromatic, with a power of 460. This
star is said to be visible even in a 1-foot achromatic with a power of
35. ε _Lyræ_, which is a quintuple star, but appears to the naked eye
as a single star,--may be seen to be double with a power of from 6 to
12 time. γ _Leonis_ is visible in a 44-inch achromatic, with a power of
180 or 200. _Rigel_ in a 3-1/2-feet achromatic, may be seen with powers
varying from 130 to 200. The small star, however, which accompanies
Rigel, is sometimes difficult to be perceived, even with such powers.
ε _Bootis_ is seldom distinctly defined with an achromatic of less
aperture than 3-1/4 inches, or a reflector of less than 5 inches, with
a power of at least 250.

These and similar stars are not to be expected to be seen equally well
at all times, even when the magnifying and illuminating powers are
properly proportioned; as much depends upon the state of the weather,
and the pureness of the atmosphere. In order to perceive the closest
of the double stars, Sir W. Herschel recommends, that the power of the
telescope should be adjusted upon a star known to be single, of nearly
the same altitude, magnitude, and colour with the double star which
is to be observed, or upon one star above and another below it. Thus,
the late Mr. Aubert, the astronomer, could not see the two stars of γ
Leonis, when the focus was adjusted upon that star itself; but he soon
observed the small star, after he had adjusted the focus upon Regulus.
An exact adjustment of the focus of the instrument is indispensably
requisite, in order to perceive such minute objects.

In viewing the _Nebulæ_, and the very small and immensely distant
fixed stars, which require much light to render them visible, a large
aperture of the object-glass or speculum, which admits of a great
quantity of light, is of more importance than high magnifying powers.
It is light chiefly, accompanied with a moderate magnifying power,
that enables us to _penetrate_ into the distant regions of space. Sir
W. Herschel, when sweeping the profundities of the Milky way, and the
Hand and Club of Orion, used a telescope of the Newtonian form, 20-feet
focal length, and 18-7/10 inches diameter, with a power of only 157.
On applying this telescope and power to a part of the _Via Lactea_, he
found that it completely resolved the whole whitish appearance into
stars, which his former telescopes had not light enough to effect; and
which smaller instruments with much higher magnifying powers would
not have effected. He tells us, that with this power, ‘the glorious
multitude of stars,’ in the vicinity of Orion, ‘of all possible sizes,
that presented themselves to view, was truly astonishing, and that
he had fields which contained 70, 90 and 110 stars, so that a belt
of 15 degrees long, and 2 degrees broad, which passed through the
field of the telescope in an hour, could not contain less than fifty
thousand stars that were large enough to be distinctly numbered.’ In
viewing the Milky way, the Nebulæ, and small clusters of stars, such
as _Præsepe_ in Cancer, I generally use a power of 55 times, on an
achromatic telescope 6 feet 6 inches in focal length, and 4 inches
diameter. The eye-piece, which produces this power--which I formed
for the purpose--consists of two convex lenses, the one next the eye
3 inches focal length, and 1-2/10 inch diameter, and that next the
object 3-1/2 inches focus, and 1-4/10 inch diameter, the deepest convex
surfaces being next each other, and their distance 1/4 inch. With this
eye-piece a very large and brilliant field of view is obtained; and I
find it preferable to any higher powers in viewing the nebulosities,
and clusters of stars. In certain spaces of the heavens, it sometimes
presents in one field, nearly a hundred stars. It likewise serves to
exhibit a very clear and interesting view of the full moon.

In observing _Comets_, a very small power should generally be used,
even on large instruments. These bodies possess so small a quantity
of light, and they are so frequently enveloped in a veil of dense
atmosphere, that _magnifying_ power sometimes renders them more
obscure; and therefore the _illuminating_ power of a large telescope,
with a small power, is in all cases to be preferred. A comet eye-piece
should be constructed with a very large and uniformly distinct field,
and should magnify only from 15 to 30 or 40 times, and the lenses of
such an eye-tube should be nearly two inches in diameter. The late
Rev. F. Wollaston recommended for observing comets, ‘a telescope with
an achromatic object-glass of 16 inches focal length, and 2 inches
aperture, with a Ramsden’s eye-glass magnifying about 25 times, mounted
on a very firm equatorial stand, the field of view taking in 2 degrees
of a great circle.’

In viewing the _moon_, various powers may be applied according to
circumstances. The best periods of the moon for inspecting the
inequalities on its surface, are either when it assumes a crescent or
a half-moon phase, or two or three days after the period of half-moon.
Several days after full-moon, and particularly about the third quarter,
when this orb is waning, and when the shadows of its mountains and
vales are thrown in a different direction from what they are when
on the increase,--the most prominent and interesting views may be
obtained. The most convenient season for obtaining such views is during
the autumnal months, when the moon, about the third quarter, sometimes
rises as early as 8 o’clock P.M., and may be viewed at a
considerably high altitude by ten or eleven. When in the positions now
alluded to, and at a high altitude, very high magnifying powers may
sometimes be applied with good effect, especially if the atmosphere be
clear and serene. I have sometimes applied a power, in such cases, of
350 times, on a 46-inch achromatic, with considerable distinctness;
but it is only two or three times in a year, and when the atmosphere
is remarkably favourable, that such a power can be used. The autumnal
evenings are generally best fitted for such observations. The _full
moon_ is an object which is never seen to advantage with high powers,
as no shadows or inequalities on its surface can then be perceived.
It forms, however, a very beautiful object, when magnifying powers
not higher than 40, 50, or 60 times are used. A power of 45 times, if
properly constructed, will show the _whole of the moon_ with a margin
around it, when the darker and brighter parts of its surface will
present a variegated aspect, and appear somewhat like a map to the eye
of the observer.

4. _Mode of exhibiting the Solar spots._

The solar spots may be contemplated with advantage by magnifying powers
varying from 60 to 180 times; about 90 times is a good medium power,
though they may sometimes be distinguished with very low powers, such
as those usually adapted to a one-foot telescope, or even by means of a
common opera-glass. The common astronomical eye-pieces given along with
achromatic telescopes, and the sun-glasses connected with them, are
generally ill-adapted for taking a pleasant and comprehensive view of
the solar spots. In the higher magnifying powers, the first eye-glass
is generally at too great a distance from the eye, and the sun-glass
which is screwed over it, removes it to a still greater distance from
the point to which the eye is applied, so that not above one third
of the field of view can be taken in. This circumstance renders it
difficult to point the instrument to any particular small spot on the
solar disk which we wish minutely to inspect; and besides, it prevents
us from taking a comprehensive view of the _relative positions_ of
all the spots that may at any time be traversing the disk. To obviate
this inconvenience, the sun-glass would require to be placed so near
to the glass next the eye as almost to touch it. But this is sometimes
difficult to be attained, and, in high powers, even the thickness of
the sun-glass itself is sufficient to prevent the eye from taking in
the whole field of view. For preventing the inconveniences to which
I now allude, I generally make use of a _terrestrial_ eye-piece of a
considerable power, with a large field, the sun-glass is fixed at the
end of a short tube which slides on the eye-piece, and permits the
coloured glass to approach within a line or two of the lens next the
eye, so that the whole field of the telescope is completely secured.
The eye-piece alluded to carries a magnifying power of 95 times for
a 46-inch telescope, and takes in about three fourths of the surface
of the sun, so that the relative positions of all the spots may
generally be perceived at one view. Such a power is, in most cases,
quite sufficient for ordinary observations; and I have seldom found any
good effect to arise from attempting very high powers, when minutely
examining the solar spots.

But, the most pleasant mode of viewing the solar spots--especially when
we wish to exhibit them to others--is to throw the image of the sun
upon a white screen, placed in a room which is considerably darkened.
It is difficult, however, when the sun is at a high altitude, to put
this method into practice, on account of the great obliquity with
which his rays then fall, which prevents a screen from being placed
at any considerable distance from the eye-end of the telescope. The
following plan, therefore, is that which I uniformly adopt as being
both the easiest and the most satisfactory. A telescope is placed in a
convenient position, so as to be directed to the sun. This telescope
is furnished with a _diagonal eye-piece_, such as that represented,
fig. 77, (p. 344.) The window-shutters of the apartment are all closed,
excepting a space sufficient to admit the solar rays; and, when the
telescope is properly adjusted, a beautiful image of the sun, with
all the spots which then happen to diversify his surface, is thrown
upon the _ceiling_ of the room. This image may be from 12 to 20, or 30
inches or more in diameter, according to the distance of the ceiling
from the diagonal eye-piece. The greater this distance is, the larger
the image. If the sun is at a very high altitude, the image will be
elliptical; if he be at no great distance from the horizon, the image
will appear circular or nearly so; but in either case the spots will be
distinctly depicted, provided the focus of the telescope be accurately
adjusted. In this exhibition, the apparent motion of the sun, produced
by the rotation of the earth, and the passage of thin fleeces of clouds
across the solar disk, exhibit a very pleasing appearance.

By this mode of viewing the solar spots we may easily ascertain their
diameter and magnitude, at least to a near approximation. We have only
to take a scale of inches, and measure the diameter of any well-defined
and remarkable spot, and then the diameter of the solar image; and,
comparing the one with the other, we can ascertain the number of miles
either lineal or square, comprehended in the dimensions of the spot.
For example, suppose a spot to measure one half-inch in diameter,
and the whole image of the sun 25 inches, the proportion between
the diameter of the spot and that of the sun will be as 1 to 50, in
other words, the _one fiftieth_ part of the sun’s diameter. Now, this
diameter being 880,000 miles, this number, divided by 50, produces a
quotient of 17,600 = the number of miles which its diameter measures.
Such a spot will therefore contain an area of 243,285,504, or more
than two hundred and forty-three millions of square miles, which is 46
millions of miles more than the whole superficies of the terraquous
globe. Again, suppose the diameter of a spot measures 3/10 inch, and
the solar image 23 inches, the proportion of the diameter of the spot
to that of the sun is as 3 to 230 = the number of tenths in 23 inches.
The number of miles in the spot’s diameter will therefore be found
by the following proportion: 230 : 880,000 :: 3 : 11,478; that is,
the diameter of such a spot measures eleven thousand four hundred and
seventy-eight miles. Spots of such sizes are not unfrequently seen to
transit the solar disk.

By this mode of viewing the image of the sun, his spots may be
exhibited to twenty or thirty individuals at once without the least
straining or injury to the eyes; and as no separate screen is
requisite, and as the ceilings of rooms are generally white, the
experiment may be performed in half a minute without any previous
preparation, except screwing on and adjusting the eye-piece. The manner
of exhibiting the solar spots, in this way, is represented in fig. 82.

[Illustration: _figure 82._]

5. _On the space-penetrating power of telescopes._--The power of
telescopes to penetrate into the profundity of space is the result of
the quantity of light they collect and send to the eye in a state fit
for vision. This property of telescopes is sometimes designated by the
expression _Illuminating Power_.

Sir W. Herschel appears to have been the first who made a distinction
between the _magnifying_ power, and the _space-penetrating_ power
of a telescope; and there are many examples which prove that such
a distinction ought to be made, especially in the case of large
instruments. For example, the small star, or speck of light, which
accompanies the pole-star, may be seen through a telescope of large
aperture, with a smaller magnifying power than with a telescope of a
small aperture furnished with a much higher power. If the magnifying
power is sufficient to show the small star completely separated from
the rays which surround the large one, this is sufficient in one point
of view; but in order that this effect may be produced, so as to render
the small star perfectly distinguishable, a certain quantity of light
must be admitted into the pupil of the eye--which quantity depends
upon the area of the object-glass or speculum of the instrument, or,
in other words, on the illuminating power. If we compare a telescope
of 2-3/4 inches aperture with one of 5 inches aperture, when the
magnifying power of each does not exceed 50 times for terrestrial
objects, the effect of illuminating power is not so evident; but
if we use a power of 100 for day objects, and 180 for the heavenly
bodies, the effects of illuminating power is so clearly perceptible,
that objects not only appear brighter, and more clearly visible, in
the larger telescope, but with the same magnifying power, they also
_appear_ larger, particularly when the satellites of Jupiter and small
stars are the objects we are viewing.

Sir W. Herschel remarks, that ‘objects are viewed in their greatest
perfection, when, in penetrating space, the magnifying power is so
low as only to be sufficient to show the object well--and when,
in magnifying objects, by way of examining them minutely, the
space-penetrating power is no higher than what will suffice for the
purpose; for in the use of either power, the injudicious overcharge
of the other will prove hurtful to vision.’ When illuminating power is
in too high a degree, the eye is offended by the extreme brightness of
the object. When it is in too low a degree, the eye is distressed by
its endeavours to see what is beyond its reach; and therefore it is
desirable, when we wish to give the eye all the assistance possible, to
have the illuminating and the magnifying powers in due proportion. What
this proportion is, depends, in a certain degree, upon the brightness
of the object. In proportion to its brightness or luminosity, the
magnifying power may, to a certain extent, be increased. Sir W.
Herschel remarks, in reference to α Lyræ, ‘This star, I surmise, has
light enough to bear being magnified, at least a hundred thousand
times, with no more than six inches of aperture.’ However beautifully
perfect any telescopes may appear, and however sharp their _defining_
power, their performance is limited by their illuminating powers--which
are as the squares of the diameters of the apertures of the respective
instruments. Thus, a telescope whose object-glass is 4 inches diameter
will have four times the quantity of light, or illuminating power,
possessed by a telescope whose aperture is only 2 inches, or in the
proportion of 16 to 4,--the square of 4 being 16, and the square of 2
being 4.

The nature of the _space-penetrating power_, to which we are
adverting, and the distinction between it, and magnifying power,
may be illustrated from a few examples taken from Sir W. Herschel’s
observations.

The first observation which I shall notice refers to the _nebula_
between η and ζ Ophiuchi, discovered by Messier in 1764. The
observation was made with a 10 feet reflector, having a magnifying
power of 250, and a space-penetrating power of 28.67. His note is dated
May 3, 1783. ‘I see several stars in it, and make no doubt a higher
power and more light will resolve it all into stars. This seems to me
a good nebula for the purpose of establishing the connection between
nebulæ and clusters of stars in general.’--‘June 18, 1784. The same
nebula viewed with a Newtonian 20 feet reflector; penetrating power 61,
and a magnifying power of 157; a very large and a very bright cluster
of excessively compressed stars. The stars are but just visible, and
are of unequal magnitudes. The large stars are red, the cluster is a
miniature of that near Flamstead’s forty-second Comæ Berenices; Right
ascension 17^h 6^m 32^s Polar distance 108° 18´´’ In this case, a
penetrating power of about 28, with a magnifying power of 250, barely
shewed a few stars; when in the second instrument the illuminating
power of 60 with the magnifying power of only 157 showed them
completely.

Subsequently to the date of the latter observation, the 20 feet
Newtonian telescope was converted into an Herschelian instrument, by
taking away the small speculum, and giving the large one the proper
inclination for obtaining the front view; by which alteration the
illuminating power was increased from 61 to 75, and the advantage
derived from the alteration was evident in the discovery of the
satellites of Uranus by the altered telescope, which before was
incompetent in the point of penetration, or illuminating power. ‘March
14, 1798, I viewed the Georgian planet (or Uranus) with a new 25 feet
reflector. Its penetrating power is 95.85, and having just before
also viewed it with my 20 feet instrument, I found that with an equal
magnifying power of 300, the 25 feet telescope had considerably the
advantage of the former.’ The aperture of the 20 feet instrument was
18.8 inches, and that of the 25 feet telescope, 24 inches, so that
the superior effect of the latter instrument must have been owing
to its greater illuminating power. The following observations show
the superior power of the 40 feet telescope as compared with the 20
feet.--‘Feb. 24, 1786, I viewed the nebula near Flamstead’s fifth
Serpentis, with my 20 feet reflector, magnifying power 157. The most
beautiful extremely compressed cluster of small stars; the greatest
part of them gathered together into one brilliant nucleus, evidently
consisting of stars, surrounded with many detached gathering stars of
the same size and colour. R.A. 15^h 7^m 12^s. P.D. 87° 8´´’--‘May 27,
1791, I viewed the same object with my 40 feet telescope, penetrating
power 191.69, magnifying power 370. A beautiful cluster of stars. I
counted about 200 of them. The middle of it is so compressed, that
it is impossible to distinguish the stars.’--‘Nov. 5, 1791, I viewed
Saturn with the 20 and 40 feet telescopes. _Twenty feet._ The fifth
satellite of Saturn is very small. The first, second, third, fourth and
fifth, and the new sixth satellites are in their calculated places.
_Forty feet._ I see the new sixth satellite much better with this
instrument than with the 20 feet. The fifth is also much larger here
than in the 20 feet, in which it was nearly the same size as a small
fixed star, but here it is considerably larger than that star.’

These examples, and many others of a similar kind, explain sufficiently
the nature and extent of that species of power that one telescope
possesses over another, in consequence of its enlarged aperture; but
the exact quantity of this power is in some degree uncertain. To
ascertain practically the illuminating power of telescopes, we must
try them with equal powers on such objects as the following,--the
small stars near the pole-star, and near Rigel and ε Bootis--the
division in the ring of Saturn--and distant objects in the twilight or
towards the evening. These objects are distinctly seen with a 5 feet
achromatic of 3-8/10 inches aperture, and an illuminating power of
144, while they are scarcely visible in a 3-1/2 feet with an aperture
of 2-3/4 inches, and an illuminating power of 72, supposing the same
magnifying power to be applied. The illuminating power of a telescope
is best estimated, in regard to land objects, when it is tried on
minute objects, and such as are badly lighted up; and the advantage
of a telescope with a large aperture will be most obvious, when it is
compared with another of inferior size in the close of the evening,
when looking at a printed bill composed of letters of various sizes. As
darkness comes on, the use of illuminating power becomes more evident.
In a 5 feet telescope some small letters will be legible, which are
hardly discernible in the 3-1/2 feet, and in the 2-1/2 feet are quite
undefinable, though the magnifying powers be equal. Sir W. Herschel
informs us, that in the year 1776, when he had erected a telescope of
20 feet focal length of the Newtonian construction, one of its effects
by trial was, that when towards evening, on account of darkness, the
natural eye could not penetrate far into space, the telescope possessed
that power sufficiently to show, by the dial of a distant church
steeple, what o’clock it was, notwithstanding the naked eye could no
longer see the steeple itself.

In order to convey an idea of the _numbers_ by which the degree of
space-penetrating power is expressed, and the general grounds on which
they rest, the following statements may be made. The depth to which the
naked eye can penetrate into the spaces of the heavens, is considered
as extending to the twelfth order of distances--in other words, it can
perceive a star at a distance 12 times farther than those luminaries,
such as Sirius, Arcturus or Capella, which, from their vivid light, we
presume to be nearest to us. It has been stated above, that Herschel
calculated his 10 feet telescope to have a space-penetrating power of
28.67, that is, it could enable us to descry a star 28 times farther
distant than the naked eye can reach. His 20 feet Newtonian was
considered as having a similar power of 61; his 25 feet, nearly 96, and
his 40 feet instrument, a power of 191.69. If each of these numbers
be multiplied by 12, the product will indicate how much farther these
telescopes will penetrate into space than the nearest range of the
fixed stars, such as those of the first magnitude. For instance, the
penetrating power of the 40 feet reflector being 191.69, this number
multiplied by 12, gives a product of 2,300, which shows, that were
there a series of two thousand three hundred stars extended in a line
beyond Sirius, Capella and similar stars--each star separated from the
one beyond it, by a space equal to the distance of Sirius from the
earth--they might be all seen through the 40 feet telescope. In short,
the penetrating power of telescopes is a circumstance which requires
to be particularly attended to in our observations of celestial
phenomena, and in many cases, is of more importance than _magnifying_
power. It is the effect produced by illuminating power that renders
telescopes, furnished with comparatively small magnifying powers, much
more efficient in observing comets and certain nebulæ and clusters of
stars, than when high powers are attempted. Every telescope may be so
adjusted, as to produce different space-penetrating powers. If we wish
to diminish such a power, we have only to contract the object-glass or
speculum, by placing circular rims, or apertures of different degrees
of breadth, across the mouth of the great tube of the instrument. But
we cannot increase this illuminating power beyond a certain extent,
which is limited by the diameter of the object-glass. When we wish
illuminating power beyond this limit, we must be furnished with an
object-glass or speculum of a larger size; and hence, the rapid advance
in price of instruments which have large apertures, and consequently
high illuminating powers. Mr. Tulley’s 3-1/2 feet achromatics of 2-3/4
inches aperture, sell at £26 5s. When the aperture is 3-1/4 inches, the
price is £42. When 3-3/4 inches, £68 5s. The following table contains a
statement of the ‘comparative lengths, apertures, illuminating powers,
and prices, of Achromatic Refractors, and Gregorian Reflectors,’
according to Dr. Kitchener.

6. _On choosing Telescopes, and ascertaining their properties._

It is an object of considerable importance, to every astronomical
observer, that he should be enabled to form a judgment of the qualities
of his telescope, and of any instruments of this description which
he may intend to purchase. The following directions may perhaps be
useful to the reader in directing him in the choice of an achromatic
refracting telescope.

Supposing that an achromatic telescope of 3-1/2 feet focal length, and
3-1/4 inches aperture were offered for sale, and that it were required
to ascertain whether the object-glass, on which its excellence chiefly
depends--is a good one and duly adjusted;--some opinion may be formed
by laying the tube of the telescope in a horizontal position, on a
firm support, about the height of the eye,--and by placing a printed
card or a watch glass vertically, but in an inverted position, against
some wall or pillar, at 40 or 50 yards distant, so as to be exposed
to a clear sky. When the telescope is directed to this object, and
accurately adjusted to the eye--should the letters on the card, or the
strokes and dots on the watch-glass appear clearly and sharply defined,
without any mistiness or coloration, and if very small points appear
well defined--great hopes may be entertained that the glass will turn
out a good one. But a telescope may appear a good one, when viewing
common terrestrial objects, to eyes unaccustomed to discriminate
deviations from perfect vision, while it may turn out to be an
indifferent one, when directed to certain celestial objects. Instead
therefore of a printed card, fix a black board, or one half of a sheet
of black paper, in a vertical position at the same distance, and a
circular disk of white writing paper, about 1/4 of an inch in diameter,
on the centre of the black ground. Then having directed the telescope
to this object, and adjusted for the place of distinct vision, mark
with a black-lead pencil the sliding eye-tube, at the end of the main
tube, so that this position can always be known; and if this sliding
tube be gradually drawn out, or pushed in, while the eye beholds the
disk, it will gradually enlarge and lose its colour, till its edges
cease to be well-defined. Now, if the enlarged misty circle is observed
to be concentric with the disk itself, the object-glass is properly
centered, as it has reference to the tube; but if the misty circle goes
to one side of the disk, the cell of the object-glass is not at right
angles to the tube, and must have its screws removed and its holes
elongated, by a rattailed file, small enough to enter the holes. When
this has been done, the cell may be replaced, and the disk examined a
second time, and a slight stroke on one edge of the cell, by a wooden
mallet, will show by the alteration made in the position of the misty
portion of the disk, how the adjustment is to be effected, which is
known to be right when a motion in the sliding tube will make the
diluted disk enlarge in a circle concentric with the disk itself. When
the disk will enlarge so as to make a ring of diluted white light round
its circumference, as the sliding tube holding the eye-piece is pushed
in or drawn out, the cell may be finally fixed by the screws passing
through its elongated holes.

When the object-glass is thus adjusted, it may then be ascertained
whether the curves of the respective lenses composing the object-glass
are well-formed and suitable for each other. If a small motion of the
sliding tube of about 1/10th of an inch in a 3-1/2 feet telescope, from
the point of distinct vision, will dilute the light of the disk and
render the appearance confused, the figure of the object-glass is good;
particularly if the same effect will take place at equal distances
from the point of distinct vision, when the tube is alternately drawn
out and pushed in. A telescope that will admit of much motion in the
sliding tube without sensibly affecting the distinctness of vision,
will not define an object well at any point of adjustment, and must
be considered as having an imperfect object-glass, inasmuch as the
spherical aberration of the transmitted rays is not duly corrected. The
due adjustment of the convex lens, or lenses, to the concave one, will
be judged of by the absence of coloration round the enlarged disk, and
is a property distinct from the spherical aberration; the achromatism
depending on the relative focal distances of the convex and concave
lenses, is regulated by the relative dispersive powers of the pieces
of glass made use of; but the distinctness of vision depends on a good
figure of the computed curves that limit the focal distances. When an
object-glass is free from imperfection in both these respects, it may
be called a good glass for terrestrial purposes.

It still, however, remains to be determined how far such an
object-glass may be good for viewing a star or a planet, and can only
be known by actual observations on the heavenly bodies. When a good
telescope is directed to the moon or to Jupiter, the achromatism
may be judged of, by alternately pushing in, and drawing out the
eye-piece, from the place of distinct vision. In the former case, a
ring of purple will be formed round the edge; and in the latter, a
ring of light green, which is the central colour of the prismatic
spectrum; for these appearances show, that the extreme colours red
and violet are corrected. Again, if one part of a lens employed have
a different refractive power from another part of it, that is, if the
flint-glass particularly is not homogeneous, a star of the first and
even of the second magnitude will point out the natural defect by the
exhibition of an irradiation, or what is called _a wing_, at one side,
which no perfection of figure or of adjustment will banish, and the
greater the aperture the more liable is the evil to happen. Hence caps
with different apertures are usually supplied with large telescopes,
that the extreme parts of the glass may be cut off, in observations
requiring a round and well-defined image of the body observed.

Another method of determining the figure and quality of an object-glass
is by first covering its centre by a circular piece of paper, as much
as one half of its diameter, and adjusting it for distinct vision of a
given object, such as the disk above mentioned, when the central rays
are intercepted--and then trying if the focal length remains unaltered
when the paper is taken away, and an aperture of the same size applied,
so that the extreme rays may in their turn be cut off. If the vision
remains equally distinct in both cases, without any new adjustment
for focal distance, the figure is good, and the spherical aberration
cured, and it may be seen by viewing a star of the first magnitude
successively in both cases, whether the irradiation is produced more
by the extreme or by the central parts of the glass. Or, in case the
one half be faulty and the other good, a semicircular aperture, by
being turned gradually round in trial, will detect what semicircle
contains the defective portion of the glass; and if such portion should
be covered, the only inconvenience that would ensue, would be the loss
of so much light as is thus excluded. When an object-glass produces
radiations in a large star, it is unfit for the nicer observations of
astronomy, such as viewing double stars of the first class. The smaller
a large star appears in any telescope, the better is the figure of the
object-glass, but if the image of the star be free from wings, the size
of its disk is not an objection in practical observations.[30]

Some opticians are in the habit of inserting a diaphragm into the
body of the large tube, to cut off the extreme rays coming from the
object-glass when the figure is not good, instead of lessening the
aperture by a cap. When this is the case, a deficiency of light will
be the consequence beyond what the apparent aperture warrants. It
is therefore proper to examine that the diaphragm be not placed too
near the object-glass, so as to intercept any of the useful rays.
Sometimes a portion of the object-glass is cut off by the stop in
the eye-tube. To ascertain this, adjust the telescope to distinct
vision, then take out the eye-glasses, and put your finger on some
other object on the edge of the outside of the object-glass, and look
down the tube; if you can see the tip of your finger, or any object
in its place, just peeping over the edge of the object-glass, no part
is cut off. I once had a 3-1/2 feet telescope whose object-glass
measured 3 inches diameter, which was neither so bright, nor did it
perform in other respects nearly so well as another of the same length
whose object-glass was only 2-3/4 inches diameter; but I found that a
diaphragm was placed about a foot within the end of the large tube,
which reduced the aperture of the object-glass to less than 2-1/2
inches; and when it was removed the telescope was less distinct than
before. The powers given along with this instrument were much lower
than usual--none of them exceeding 100 times. This is a trick not
uncommon with some opticians.

Dr. Pearson mentions that an old Dollond’s telescope of 63 inches focal
length, and 3-3/4 inches aperture, supposed to be an excellent one,
was brought to Mr. Tulley, when he was present, and the result of the
examination was that its achromatism was not perfect. The imperfection
was thus determined by experiment. A small glass globe was placed at 40
yards distance from the object-end of the telescope when the sun was
shining, and the speck of light seen reflected from this globe formed a
good substitute for a large star, as an object to be viewed. When the
focal length of the object-glass was adjusted to this luminous object,
no judgment could be formed of its prismatic aberrations, till the
eye-piece had been pushed in beyond the place of correct vision; but
when the telescope was shortened a little, the luminous disk occasioned
by such shortening was strongly tinged with _red_ rays at its
circumference. On the contrary, when the eye-piece was drawn out, so as
to lengthen the telescope too much, the disk thus produced was tinged
with a small circle of _red_ at its _centre_, thereby denoting that
the convex lens had too short a focal length; and Mr. Tulley observed,
that if one or both of the curves of the convex lens were flattened
till the total focal length should be about 4 inches increased, it
would render the telescope quite achromatic, provided in doing this the
aberration should not be increased.

The following general remarks may be added. 1. To make anything
like an accurate comparison of telescopes, they must be tried not
only at the same place, but as nearly as possible at the same time,
and, if the instruments are of the same length and construction,
if possible, with the same eye-piece. 2. A difference of 8 or 10
times in the magnifying power, will sometimes, on certain objects,
give quite a different character to a telescope. It has been found
by various experiments that object-glasses of two or three inches
longer focus will produce different vision with the same eye-piece.
3. Care must be taken to ascertain that the eye-glasses are perfectly
clean and free from defects. The defects of glass are either from
veins--specks--scratches--colour, or an incorrect figure. To discover
veins in an eye or an object-glass, place a candle at the distance of
4 or 5 yards; then look through the glass, and move it from your eye
till it appear full of light--you will then see every vein, or other
imperfection in it which may distort the objects and render vision
imperfect. Specks or scratches, especially in object-glasses, are not
so injurious as veins, for they do not distort the object, but only
intercept a portion of the light. 4. We cannot judge accurately of the
excellence of any telescope by observing objects with which we are
not familiarly acquainted. Opticians generally try an instrument at
their own marks, such as the dial-plate of a watch, a finely engraved
card, a weather-cock, or the moon and the planet Jupiter, when near
the meridian. Of several telescopes of the same length, aperture and
magnifying power, that one is generally considered the best with which
we can read a given print at the greatest distance, especially if the
print consists of _figures_, such as a table of logarithms, where the
eye is not apt to be deceived by the imagination, in _guessing_ at the
sense of a passage, when two or three words are distinguished.

There is a circumstance which I have frequently noticed, in reference
to achromatic telescopes, particularly those of a small size, and which
I have never seen noticed by any optical writer. It is this,--if the
telescope, when we are viewing objects, be gradually turned round its
axis, there is a certain position in which the objects will appear
distinct and accurately defined; and if it be turned round exactly
a semicircle from this point, the same degree of distinctness is
perceived; but in all other positions, there is an evident want of
clearness and defining power. This I find to be the case in more than
ten 1 foot and 2 feet telescopes now in my possession; and therefore
I have put marks upon the object-end of each of them, to indicate the
positions in which they should be used for distinct observation.--This
is a circumstance which requires, in many cases, to be attended to
in the choice and the use of telescopical instruments, and in fixing
and adjusting them on their pedestals. In some telescopes this defect
is very striking, but it is in some measure perceptible in the great
majority of instruments which I have had occasion to inspect. Even in
large and expensive achromatic telescopes this defect is sometimes
observable. I have an achromatic whose object-glass is 4-1/10 inches
diameter, which was much improved in its defining power, by being
unscrewed from its original position, or turned round its axis--about
one-eighth part of its circumference. This defect is best detected by
looking at a large printed bill, or a sign-post at a distance, when, on
turning round the telescope or object-glass, the letters will appear
much better defined in one position than in another. The position in
which the object appears least distinct is when the upper part of the
telescope is a quadrant of a circle different from the two positions
above-stated, or at an equal distance from each of them.

7. _On the mode of determining the magnifying power of Telescopes._

In regard to refracting telescopes, we have already shown that, when a
single eye-glass is used, the magnifying power may be found by dividing
the focal distance of the object-glass by that of the eye-glass. But
when a Huygenian eye-piece, or a four-glass terrestrial eye-piece such
as is now common in achromatic telescopes, is used, the magnifying
power cannot be ascertained in this manner; and in some of the delicate
observations of practical astronomy, it is of the utmost importance
to know the exact magnifying power of the instrument with which the
observations are made, particularly when micrometrical measurements
are employed to obtain the desired results.--The following is a
general method of finding the magnifying powers of telescopes when the
instrument called a _dynameter_ is not employed; and it answers for
refracting and reflecting telescopes of every description.

Having put up a small circle of paper, an inch or two in diameter, at
the distance of about 100 yards, draw upon a card 2 black parallel
lines, whose distance from each other is equal to the diameter of the
paper circle. Then view through the telescope the paper circle with one
eye, and the parallel lines with the other; and let the parallel lines
be moved nearer to or further from, the eye, till they seem exactly
to cover the small circle viewed through the telescope. The quotient
obtained by dividing the distance of the paper circle by the distance
of the parallel lines from the eye, will be the magnifying power of the
telescope. It requires a little practice before this experiment can
be performed with accuracy. The one eye must be accustomed to look at
an object near at hand, while the other is looking at a more distant
object through the telescope. Both eyes must be open at the same time,
and the image of the object seen through the telescope must be brought
into apparent contact with the real object near at hand. But a little
practice will soon enable any observer to perform the experiment with
ease and correctness, if the telescope be mounted on a firm stand, and
its elevation or depression produced by rack-work.

The following is another method, founded on the same
principle:--Measure the space occupied by a number of the courses, or
rows of bricks in a modern building--which, upon an average, is found
to have 8 courses in 2 feet, so that each course or row, is 3 inches.
Then cut a piece of paper 3 inches in height, and of the length of a
brick--which is about 9 inches--so that it may represent a brick, and
fixing the paper against the brick wall, place the telescope to be
examined at the distance of about 80 or 100 yards from it. Now, looking
through the telescope at the paper with one eye, and at the same time,
with the other eye, looking past the telescope, observe what extent of
wall the magnified image of the paper appears to cover, then count the
courses of bricks in that extent, and it will give the magnifying power
of the telescope. It is to be observed, however, that the magnifying
power determined in this way, will be a fraction greater than for very
distant objects, as the focal distance of the telescope is necessarily
lengthened in order to obtain distinct vision of near objects.

In comparing the magnifying powers of two telescopes, or of the same
telescope, when different magnifying powers are employed, I generally
use the following simple method. The telescopes are placed at 8 or 10
feet distant from a window, with their eye-ends parallel to each other,
or at the same distance from the window. Looking at a distant object,
I fix upon a portion of it whose magnified image will appear to fill
exactly two or three panes of the window. Then putting on a different
power, or looking through another telescope, I observe the same
object, and mark exactly the extent of its image on the window-panes,
and compare the extent of the one image with the other. Suppose for
example, that the one telescope has been previously found to magnify
90 times, and that the image of the object fixed upon exactly fills
three panes of the window, and that with the other power or the other
telescope, the image fills exactly two panes, then the magnifying power
is equal to two thirds of the former, or 60 times; and were it to
fill only one pane, the power would be about 30 times. A more correct
method is to place at one side of the window, a narrow board, two or
three feet long, divided into 15 or 20 equal parts, and observe how
many of these parts appear to be covered by the respective images, of
the different telescopes. Suppose, in the one case, 10 divisions to be
covered by the image, in a telescope magnifying 90 times, and that the
image of the same object in another telescope, measures 6 divisions,
then its power is found by the following proportion, 10 : 90 : 6 : 54 :
that is, this telescope magnifies 54 times.

Another mode which I have used for determining, to a near
approximation, the powers of telescopes, is as follows:--Endeavour
to find the focus of a single lens which is exactly equivalent to
the magnifying power of the eye-piece, whether the Huygenian or the
common terrestrial eye-piece. This may be done by taking a small lens,
and using it as an object-glass to the eye-piece. Looking through
the eye-piece to a window and holding the lens at a proper distance,
observe whether the image of one of the panes exactly coincides with
the pane, as seen by the naked eye; if it does, then the magnifying
power of the eye-piece is equal to that of the lens. If the lens be
1/2 inch focal length, the eye-piece will produce the same magnifying
power, as a single lens when used as an eye-glass to the telescope, and
the magnifying power will then be found by dividing the focal distance
of the object-glass by that of the eye-glass. But if the image of
the pane of glass does not exactly coincide with the pane as seen by
the other eye, then proportional parts may be taken by observing the
divisions of such a board as described above, or we may try lenses of
different focal distances. Suppose, for example, that a lens 2 inches
focal length had been used, and that the image of a pane covered
exactly the space of two panes, the power of the eye-piece is then
equal to that of a single lens 1 inch focal distance.

The following is another mode depending on the same general principle.
If a slip of writing-paper one inch long, or a disk of the same
material of one inch diameter, be placed on a black ground at from
30 to 50 yards distance from the object-end of the telescope, and a
staff painted white, and divided into inches and parts by strong black
lines, be placed vertically near the said paper or disk; the eye that
is directed through the telescope when adjusted for vision, will see
the magnified disk, and the other eye, looking along the outside of
the telescope, will observe the number of inches and parts that the
disk projected on it will just cover, and as many inches as are thus
covered will indicate the magnifying power of the telescope--at the
distance for which it is adjusted for distinct vision. The solar power,
or powers for very distant objects, may be obtained by the following
proportion:--As the terrestrial focal length, at the given distance:
is to the solar focal length :: so is the terrestrial power, to the
solar power. For example, a disk of white paper one inch in diameter,
was placed on a black board, and suspended on a wall contiguous to a
vertical black staff that was graduated into inches by strong white
lines, at a distance of 33 yards 2-1/2 feet, and when the adjustment
for vision was made with a 42 inch telescope, the left eye of the
observer viewed the disk projected on the staff, while the right eye
observed that the enlarged image of the disk covered just 58-1/2 inches
on the staff, which number was the measure of the magnifying power,
at the distance answering to 33 yards 2-1/2 feet--which in this case
exceeded the solar focus by an inch and a half. Then according to the
above analogy, we have, as 43.5 : 42 :: 58.5 : 56.5 nearly. Hence the
magnifying power due to the solar focal length of the telescope in
question is 56.5, and the distance 33 yards 2-1/2 feet, is that which
corresponds to an elongation of the solar focal distance an inch and a
half.[31] If we multiply the terrestrial and the solar focal distances
together, and divide the product by their difference, we shall again
obtain the distance of the terrestrial object from the telescope. Thus,
(43.5 + 42)/1.5 = 1218 inches = 101.5 feet, or 33 yards 2-1/2 feet.

The magnifying power of a telescope is also determined, by measuring
the image which the object-glass or the large speculum of a telescope
forms at its solar focus. This is accomplished by means of an
instrument called a _Dynameter_. This apparatus consists of a strip of
mother-of-pearl, marked with equal divisions, from the 1/100th to the
1/1000th of an inch apart, according to the accuracy required. This
measure is attached to a magnifying lens in its focus, in order to
make the small divisions more apparent. When the power of a telescope
is required, the person must measure the clear aperture of the
object-glass, then holding the pearl _dynameter_ next the eye-glass,
let him observe how many divisions the small circle of light occupies,
when the instrument is directed to a bright object. Then by dividing
the diameter of the object-glass by the diameter of this circle of
light, the power will be obtained.[32] The most accurate instrument
of this kind is the _Double Image Dynameter_ invented by Ramsden,
and another on the same principle now made by Dollond, a particular
description of which may be found in Dr. Pearson’s ‘Introduction to
Practical Astronomy.’ The advantage attending these dynameters is that
they do not require any knowledge of the thickness and focal lengths
of any of the lenses employed in a telescope, nor yet of their number
or relative positions; neither does it make any difference whether
the construction be refracting or reflecting, direct or inverting.
One operation includes the result arising from the most complicated
construction.

I shall only mention farther the following method of discovering the
magnifying power, which is founded on the same general principle as
alluded to above. Let the telescope be placed in such a position
opposite the sun, that the rays of light may fall perpendicularly on
the object-glass; and the pencil of rays may be received on a piece of
paper, and its diameter measured. Then, as the diameter of the pencil
of rays is to that of the object-glass, so is the magnifying power of
the telescope.

8.--_On cleaning the lenses of telescopes._--

It is necessary, in order to distinct vision, that the glasses,
particularly the eye-glasses of telescopes be kept perfectly clean,
free of damp, dust, or whatever may impede the transmission of the
rays of light. But great caution ought to be exercised in the wiping
of them, as they are apt to be scratched, or otherwise injured by
a rough and incautious mode of cleaning them. They should never be
attempted to be wiped unless they really require it; and, in this
case, they should be wiped carefully and gently with a piece of new
and soft lamb’s-skin leather. If this be not at hand, a piece of fine
silk paper, or fine clean linen may be used as a substitute. The lens
which requires to be most particularly attended to is the second glass
from the eye, or the field-glass; for if any dust or other impediment
be found upon this glass, it is always distinctly seen, being magnified
by the glass next the eye. The next glass which requires attention is
the fourth from the eye, or that which is next the object. Unless the
glass next the eye be very dusty, a few small spots or grains of dust
are seldom perceptible. The object-glass of an achromatic should seldom
be touched, unless damp adheres to it. Care should be taken never to
use pocket handkerchiefs or dirty rags for wiping lenses. From the
frequent use of such articles, the glasses of seaman’s telescopes get
dimmed and scratched in in the course of a few years. If the glasses be
exceedingly dirty, and if greasy substances are attached to them, they
may be soaked in spirits and water, and afterwards carefully wiped.
In replacing the glasses in their socket, care should be taken not
to touch the surfaces with the fingers, as they would be dimmed with
the perspiration: they should be taken hold of by the edges only, and
carefully screwed into the same cells from which they were taken.


ON MEGALASCOPES, OR TELESCOPES FOR VIEWING VERY NEAR OBJECTS.

It appears to have been almost overlooked by opticians and others, that
telescopes may be constructed so as to exhibit a beautiful and minute
view of very near objects, and to produce even a microscopic effect,
without the least alteration in the _arrangement_ of the lenses of
which they are composed. This object is effected simply by making the
eye-tube of a telescope of such a length as to be capable of being
drawn out 12 or 13 inches beyond the point of distinct vision for
distant objects. The telescope is then rendered capable of exhibiting
with distinctness all kinds of objects, from the most distant to those
which are placed within 3 or 4 feet of the instrument--or not nearer
than double the focal distance of the object-glass. Our telescopes,
however, are seldom or never fitted with tubes that slide farther than
an inch or two beyond the point of distinct vision for distant objects,
although a tube of a longer size than usual, or an additional tube
would cost but a very trifling expence.

The following, among many others, are some of the objects on which I
have tried many amusing experiments with telescopes fitted up with
the long tubes to which I allude. The telescope to which I shall
more particularly advert is an achromatic, mounted on a pedestal,
having an object-glass about 19 inches focal length, and 1-5/8 inch
diameter, with magnifying powers for distant objects of 13 and 20
times. When this instrument is directed to a miniature portrait,
3-1/2 inches in length, placed in a good light, at the distance of
about 8 or 10 feet, it appears as large as an oil-painting four or
five feet long, and represents the individual as large as life. The
features of the face appear to stand out in bold relief: and perhaps
there is no representation of the human figure that more resembles
the living prototype, than in this exhibition, provided the miniature
is finely executed. In this case the tube requires to be pulled out
four or five inches from the point of distinct vision for distant
objects, and consequently the magnifying power is proportionally
increased. Another class of objects to which such a telescope may be
applied is _Perspective prints_, either of public buildings, streets
or landscapes. When viewed in this way they present a panoramic
appearance, and seem nearly as natural as life--just in the same manner
as they appear in the Optical Diagonal Machine, or when reflected in
a large concave mirror--with this advantage, that, while in these
instruments the left hand side of the print appears where the right
should be,--the objects seen through the telescope appear exactly in
their natural position. In this case, however, the telescope should
have a small magnifying power, not exceeding 5 or 6 times, so as to
take in the whole of the landscape. If an astronomical eye-piece be
used, the print will require to be inverted.

Other kinds of objects which may be viewed with this instrument, are
trees, flowers, and other objects in gardens immediately adjacent to
the apartment in which we make our observations. In this way we may
obtain a distinct view of a variety of rural objects, which we cannot
easily approach, such as the buds and blossoms on the tops of trees,
and the insects with which they may be infested. There are certain
objects on which the telescope may be made to produce a powerful
microscopical effect, such as the more delicate and beautiful kinds
of flowers, the leaves of trees, and similar objects. In viewing
such objects, the telescope may be brought within little more than
double the focal distance of the object-glass from the objects to be
viewed, and then the magnifying power is very considerably increased.
A nosegay composed of a variety of delicate flowers, and even a
single flower, such as the sea-pink, makes a splendid appearance in
this way. A peacock’s feather, or even the fibres on a common quill,
appear very beautiful, when placed in a proper light. The leaves of
trees, particularly the leaf of the plane-tree, when placed against a
window-pane, so that the light may shine through them--appear, in all
their internal ramifications, more distinct, beautiful and interesting,
than when viewed in any other way; and in such views a large portion
of the object is at once exhibited to the eye. In this case, the
eye-piece of such a telescope as that alluded to requires to be drawn
out 12 or 14 inches beyond the point of distinct vision for objects
at a distance--and the distance between these near objects and the
object-end of the telescope, is only about 3-1/2 feet.

A telescope having a diagonal eye-piece presents a very pleasant view
of near objects in this manner. With an instrument of this kind, I have
frequently viewed the larger kind of small objects alluded to above,
such as the leaves of shrubs and trees, flowers consisting of a variety
of parts, the fibres of a peacock’s feather and similar objects. In
this case the object-glass of the instrument, which is 10-1/2 inches
focal length, was brought within 22 inches of the object, and the eye
looked down upon it, in the same manner, as when we view objects in
a compound microscope. A common pocket achromatic telescope may be
used for the purposes now stated, provided the tube in the eye-piece
containing the two lenses next the object, be taken out, in which case
the two glasses next the eye form an astronomical eye-piece, and the
tubes may be drawn out 5 or 6 inches beyond the focal point for distant
objects, and will produce distinct vision for objects not farther
distant than about 20 or 24 inches. But, in this case, the objects to
be viewed must be inverted, in order that they may be seen in their
natural positions when viewed through the instrument. Telescopes of
a large size and high magnifying powers may likewise be used with
advantage for viewing very near objects in gardens adjacent to the room
in which the instruments are placed, provided the sliding-tube next the
eye has a range of two or three inches beyond the point of vision for
distant objects. In this case, a magnifying power of 100 times on a
3-1/2 or a 5 feet achromatic produces a very pleasant effect. In making
the observations to which I have now alluded, it is requisite in order
to distinct vision, and to obtain a pleasing view of the objects, that
the instrument should be placed on a pedestal, and capable of a motion
in every direction. The adjustment for distinct vision may be made
either by the sliding-tube, or by removing the telescope nearer to or
farther from the object.


REFLECTIONS ON LIGHT AND VISION--AND ON THE NATURE AND UTILITY OF
TELESCOPES.

Light is one of the most wonderful and beneficial, and at the same time
one of the most mysterious agents in the material creation. Though the
sun from which it flows to this part of our system is nearly a hundred
millions of miles from our globe, yet we perceive it as evidently, and
feel its influence as powerfully, as if it emanated from no higher a
region than the clouds. It supplies life and comfort to our physical
system, and without its influence and operations on the various objects
around us, we could scarcely subsist and participate of enjoyment for a
single hour. It is diffused around us on every hand from its fountain
the sun; and even the stars, though at a distance hundreds of thousands
of times greater than that of the solar orb, transmit to our distant
region a portion of this element. It gives beauty and fertility to the
earth, it supports the vegetable and animal tribes, and is connected
with the various motions which are going forward throughout the
system of the universe. It unfolds to us the whole scenery of external
nature--the lofty mountains and the expansive plains, the majestic
rivers and the mighty ocean; the trees, the flowers, the crystal
streams, and the vast canopy of the sky adorned with ten thousands of
shining orbs. In short there is scarcely an object within the range of
our contemplation, but what is exhibited to our understanding through
the medium of light, or at least bears a certain relation to this
enlivening and universal agent. When we consider the extreme minuteness
of the rays of light, their inconceivable velocity, the invariable laws
by which they act upon all bodies, the multifarious phenomena produced
by their inflections, refractions and reflections, while their original
properties remain the same; the endless variety of colours they
produce on every part of our terrestrial creation, and the facility
with which millions of rays pass through the smallest apertures, and
pervade substances of great density, while every ray passes forward in
the crowd without disturbing another, and produces its own specific
impression--we cannot but regard this element as the most wonderful,
astonishing and delightful part of the material creation. When we
consider the admirable beauties and the exquisite pleasures of which
light is the essential source, and how much its nature is still
involved in mystery, notwithstanding the profound investigations of
modern philosophers, we may well exclaim with the Poet:--

    “How then shall I attempt to sing of HIM
    Who, light himself, in uncreated light
    Invested deep, dwells awfully retired
    From mortal eye or angel’s purer ken;
    Whose single smile has, from the first of time,
    Filled, overflowing, all yon lamps of heaven,
    That beam for ever through the boundless sky.”--THOMSON.

The eye is the instrument by which we perceive the beautiful and
multifarious effects of this universal agent. Its delicate and
complicated structure, its diversified muscles, its coats and
membranes, its different humours possessed of different refractive
powers, and the various contrivances for performing and regulating
its external and internal motions, so as to accomplish the ends
intended--clearly demonstrate this organ to be a master-piece of
Divine mechanism--the workmanship of Him whose intelligence surpasses
conception, and whose Wisdom is unsearchable. ‘Our sight (says Addison)
is the most perfect and delightful of all our senses. It fills the
mind with the largest variety of ideas, converses with its objects at
the greatest distance, and continues the longest in action, without
being tired or satiated with its proper enjoyments. The sense of
feeling can indeed give us a notion of extension, shape, and all other
ideas that enter the eye, except colours; but at the same time it is
very much strained, and confined in its operation to the number, bulk
and distance of its particular objects. Our sight seems designed to
supply all these defects, and may be considered as a more delicate and
diffusive kind of touch that spreads itself over an infinite multitude
of bodies, comprehends the largest figures, and brings into our reach
some of the more remote parts of the universe.’

Could we suppose an order of beings endued with every human faculty but
that of sight, it would appear incredible to such beings--accustomed
only to the slow information of touch--that by the addition of an
organ consisting of a ball and socket, of an inch diameter, they might
be enabled, in an instant of time, without changing their place, to
perceive the disposition of a whole army, the order of a battle, the
figure of a magnificent palace, or all the variety of a landscape. If
a man were by feeling to find out the figure of the Peak of Teneriffe,
or even of St. Peter’s church at Rome, it would be the work of a
lifetime. It would appear still more incredible to such beings as we
have supposed, if they were informed of the discoveries which may
be made by this little organ in things far beyond the reach of any
other sense--that, by means of it we can find our way in the pathless
ocean--that we can traverse the globe of the earth, determine its
figure and dimensions, and delineate every region of it--yea, that we
can measure the planetary orbs, and make discoveries in the sphere of
the fixed stars. And, if they were farther informed that, by means of
this same organ, we can perceive the tempers and dispositions, the
passions and affections of our fellow-creatures, even when they want
most to conceal them--that when the tongue is taught most artfully to
lie and dissemble, the hypocrisy should appear in the countenance to a
discerning eye--and that by this organ we can often perceive what is
straight and what is crooked in the mind as well as in the body--would
it not appear still more astonishing to beings such as we have now
supposed?[33]

Notwithstanding these wonderful properties of the organ of vision, the
eye, when unassisted by art, is comparatively limited in the range
of its powers. It cannot ascertain the existence of certain objects
at the distance of three or four miles, nor perceive what is going
forward in nature or art beyond such a limit. By its natural powers
we perceive the moon to be a globe about half a degree in diameter,
and diversified with two or three dusky spots, and that the sun is
a luminous body of apparently the same size--that the planets are
luminous points, and that about a thousand stars exist in the visible
canopy of the sky. But the ten thousandth part of those luminaries,
which are within the reach of human vision, can never be seen by the
unassisted eye. Here the TELESCOPE interposes, and adds a new
power to the organ of vision, by which it is enabled to extend its
views to regions of space immeasurably distant, and to objects, the
number and magnitude of which could never otherwise have been surmised
by the human imagination. By its aid we obtain a sensible demonstration
that space is boundless--that the universe is replenished with
innumerable suns and worlds--that the remotest regions of immensity,
immeasurably beyond the limits of unassisted vision, display the
energies of Creating Power, and that the Empire of the Creator extends
far beyond what eye hath seen or the human imagination can conceive.

The telescope is an instrument of a much more wonderful nature than
what most people are apt to imagine. However popular such instruments
now are, and however common a circumstance it is to contemplate objects
at a great distance which the naked eye cannot discern, yet, prior
to their invention and improvement, it would have appeared a thing
most mysterious, if not impossible, that objects at the distance of
ten miles could be made to appear as if within a few yards of us, and
that some of the heavenly bodies could be seen as distinctly as if we
had been transported by some superior power, hundreds of millions of
miles beyond the bounds of our terrestrial habitation. Who could ever
have imagined--reasoning _a priori_--that the refraction of light in
glass--the same power by which a straight rod appears crooked in water,
by which vision is variously distorted, and by which we are liable to
innumerable deceptions--that that same power, or law of nature, by the
operation of which the objects in a landscape appear distorted when
seen through certain panes of glass in our windows, that that power
should ever be so modified and directed as to extend the boundaries
of vision, and enable us clearly to distinguish scenes and objects at
a distance a thousand times beyond the natural limits of our visual
organs? Yet such are the discoveries which science has achieved,
such the powers it has brought to light, that by glasses ground into
different forms, and properly adapted to each other, we are enabled as
it were to contract the boundaries of space, to penetrate into the most
distant regions, and to bring within the reach of our knowledge the
most sublime objects in the universe.

When Pliny declared in reference to Hipparchus, the ancient astronomer,
‘_Ausus rem Deo improbam annumerare posteris stellas_,’--that ‘he dared
to enumerate the stars for posterity, an undertaking forbidden by God,’
what would that natural historian have said, had it been foretold that
in less than 1600 years afterwards, a man would arise who should enable
posterity to perceive, and to enumerate ten times more new stars than
Hipparchus ever beheld--who should point out higher mountains on the
moon than on the earth, who should discover dark spots, as large as our
globe, in the sun, the fountain of light--who should descry four moons
revolving in different periods of time around the planet Jupiter, and
could show to surrounding senators the varying phases of Venus? and
that another would soon after arise who should point out a double ring
of six hundred thousand miles in circumference, revolving around the
planet Saturn, and ten hundreds of thousands of stars which neither
Hipparchus nor any of the ancient astronomers could ever descry? Yet
these are only a small portion of the discoveries made by Galileo
and Herschel, by means of the telescope. Had any one prophetically
informed Archimedes, the celebrated geometrician of Syracuse, that
vision would, in after ages, be thus wonderfully assisted by art--and
further, that one manner of improving vision would be to place a dark
_opake_ body directly between the object and the eye--and that another
method would be, not to look at the object, but to keep the eye quite
in a different, and even in an _opposite_ direction, or to stand with
the back directly opposed to it, and to behold all the parts of it,
invisible to the naked eye, most distinctly in this way--he would,
doubtless have considered the prophet as an enthusiastic fool or a
raving madman. Yet these things have been realized in modern times in
the fullest extent. In the Gregorian reflecting telescope an opake
body, namely the small speculum near the end of the tube, interposes
_directly_ between the eye and the object. In the Newtonian Reflector,
and in the diagonal eye-pieces formerly described, the eye is directed
in a line at right angles to the object, or a deviation of 90 degrees
from the direct line of vision. In Herschel’s’ large telescopes, and in
the _Aerial Reflector_ formerly described (in pp. 311-325) the back is
turned to the object, and the eye in an opposite direction.

These circumstances should teach us humility and a becoming diffidence
in our own powers; and they should admonish us not to be too dogmatical
or peremptory in affirming what is possible or impossible in regard
either to nature or art, or to the operations of the Divine Being.
Art has accomplished, in modern times, achievements, in regard to
locomotion, marine and aërial navigation, the improvement of vision,
the separation and combinations of invisible gases, and numerous
other objects, of which the men of former ages could not have formed
the least conception. And even yet, we can set no boundaries to the
future discoveries of science and the improvements of art; but have
every reason to indulge the hope that, in the ages to come, scenes of
Divine mechanism in the system of nature will be unfolded, and the
effects of chemical and mechanical powers displayed, of which the human
mind, in its present state of progress, cannot form the most imperfect
idea. Such circumstances likewise should teach us not to reject any
intimations which have been made to us in relation to the character,
attributes, and dispensations of the Divine Being, and the moral
revelations of his will given in the Sacred Records, because we are
unable to comprehend every truth and to remove every difficulty, which
relates to the moral government of the Great Ruler of the universe.
For, if we meet with many circumstances in secular science, and even in
the common operations of nature, which are difficult to comprehend--if
even the construction of such telescopes as we now use, would have
appeared an incomprehensible mystery to ancient philosophers--we must
expect to find difficulties almost insurmountable to such limited
minds as ours, in the eternal plans and moral arrangements of the
“King Immortal and Invisible,” as delineated only in their outlines,
in the Sacred Oracles--particularly those which relate to the origin
of physical and moral evil, the ultimate destiny of man, and the
invisible realities of a future world.

The UTILITY of the telescope may be considered in relation to
the following circumstances.

In the first place, it may be considered as an instrument or machine
which virtually transports us to the distant regions of space. When
we look at the moon through a telescope which magnifies 200 times,
and survey its extensive plains, its lofty peaks, its circular ranges
of mountains, throwing their deep shadows over the vales, its deep
and rugged caverns, and all the other varieties which appear on the
Lunar surface, we behold such objects in the same manner as if we were
standing at a point 238,800 miles from the earth in the direction of
the moon, or only twelve hundred miles from that orb, reckoning its
distance to be 240,000 miles. When we view the planet Saturn with a
similar instrument, and obtain a view of its belts, and satellites, and
its magnificent rings, we are transported, as it were, through regions
of space, to a point in the heavens more than _nine hundred millions
of miles_ from the surface of our globe, and contemplate those august
objects, as if we were placed within five millions of miles of the
surface of that planet.[34] Although a supernatural power, sufficient
to carry us in such a celestial journey, a thousand miles every day,
were exerted--it would require more than two thousand four hundred and
sixty years, before we could arrive at such a distant position; yet
the telescope, in a few moments, transports our visual powers to that
far distant point of space. When we view, with such an instrument, the
minute and very distant clusters of stars in the Milky Way, we are
carried in effect through the regions of space to the distance of _five
hundred thousand millions of miles_ from the earth; for we behold those
luminaries through the telescope nearly as if they were actually viewed
from such a distant point in the spaces of the firmament. These stars
cannot be conceived as less than _a hundred billions_ of miles from
our globe, and the instrument we have supposed brings them within the
two hundredth part of this distance. Suppose we were carried forward
by a rapid motion towards this point, at the rate of a thousand miles
_every hour_, it would require more than _fifty-seven thousand years_,
before we could reach that very distant station in space to which the
telescope, _in effect_, transports us. So that this instrument is far
more efficient in opening to our view the scenes of the universe than
if we were invested with powers of locomotion to carry us through the
regions of space, with the rapidity of a cannon ball at its utmost
velocity; and all the while we may sit at ease in our terrestrial
apartments.

In the next place, the telescope has been _the means of enlarging
our views of the sublime scenes of creation_, more than any other
instrument which art has contrived. Before the invention of this
instrument the universe was generally conceived as circumscribed within
very narrow limits. The earth was considered as among the largest
bodies in creation; the planets were viewed as bodies of a far less
size than what they are now found to be; no bodies similar to our moon
were suspected as revolving around any of them; and the stars were
supposed to be little more than a number of brilliant lamps hung up
to emit a few glimmering rays, and to adorn the canopy of our earthly
habitation. Such a wonderful phenomenon as the Ring of Saturn was
never once suspected, and the sun was considered as only a large ball
of fire. It was suspected, indeed, that the moon was diversified with
mountains and vales, and that it might possibly be a habitable world;
but nothing certainly could be determined on this point, on account of
the limited nature of unassisted vision. But the telescope has been
the means of expanding our views of the august scenes of creation to
an almost unlimited extent. It has withdrawn the veil which formerly
interposed to intercept our view of the distant glories of the sky.
It has brought to light five new planetary bodies, unknown to former
astronomers, one of which is more than eighty times larger than the
earth--and seventeen _secondary_ planets which revolve around the
primary. It has expanded the dimensions of the solar system to double
the extent which was formerly supposed. It has enabled us to descry
hundreds of comets which would otherwise have escaped our unassisted
vision, and to determine some of their trajectories and periods of
revolution.

It has explored the profundities of the Milky Way, and enabled us to
perceive hundreds of thousands of those splendid orbs, where scarcely
one is visible to the naked eye. It has laid open to our view thousands
of _Nebulæ_, of various descriptions, dispersed through different
regions of the firmament--many of them containing thousands of separate
stars. It has directed our investigations to thousands of double,
treble and multiple stars--suns revolving around suns, and systems
around systems, and has enabled us to determine some of the periods of
their revolutions. It has demonstrated the immense distances of the
starry orbs from our globe, and their consequent magnitudes; since
it shows us that, having brought them nearer to our view by several
hundreds or thousands of times, they still appear only as so many
shining _points_. It has enabled us to perceive that mighty changes are
going forward throughout the regions of immensity--new stars appearing,
and others removed from our view, and motions of incomprehensible
velocity carrying forward those magnificent orbs through the spaces of
the firmament. In short, it has opened a vista to regions of space so
immeasurably distant, that a cannon ball impelled with its greatest
velocity, would not reach tracts of creation so remote in two thousand
millions of years, and even light itself, the swiftest body in nature,
would require more than a thousand years before it could traverse this
mighty interval. It has thus laid a foundation for our acquiring an
approximate idea of the infinity of space, and for obtaining a glimpse
of the far distant scenes of creation, and the immense extent of the
universe.

Again, the telescope, in consequence of the discoveries it has enabled
us to make, has tended _to amplify our conceptions of the attributes
and the Empire of the Deity_. The amplitude of our conceptions of
the Divine Being bears a certain proportion to the expansion of our
views in regard to his works of creation, and the operations he is
incessantly carrying forward throughout the universe. If our views of
the works of God, and of the manifestations he has given of himself to
his intelligent creatures, be circumscribed to a narrow sphere, as to
a parish, a province, a kingdom, or a single world, our conceptions of
that Great Being, will be proportionably limited. For it is chiefly
from the manifestation of God in the material creation that our
ideas of his Power, his Wisdom, and his other natural attributes,
are derived. But in proportion to the ample range of prospect we
are enabled to take of the operations of the Most High, will be
our conceptions of his character, attributes, and agency. Now, the
telescope--more than any other invention of man--has tended to open to
our view the most magnificent and extensive prospects of the works of
God. It has led us to ascertain that, within the limits of the solar
system, there are bodies which, taken together, comprise a mass of
matter nearly two thousand five hundred times greater than that of the
earth--that these bodies are all constituted and arranged in such a
manner as to fit them for being habitable worlds--and that the sun, the
centre of this system, is five hundred times larger than the whole.
But, far beyond the limits of this system, it has presented to our view
a universe beyond the grasp of finite intelligences, and to which human
imagination can assign no boundaries. It has enabled us to descry suns
clustering behind suns, rising to view in boundless perspective, in
proportion to the extent of its magnifying and illuminating powers--the
numbers of which are to be estimated, not merely by thousands, and
tens of thousands, and hundreds of thousands, but by scores of
_millions_--leaving us no room to doubt that hundreds of millions more,
beyond the utmost limits of human vision, even when assisted by art,
lie hid from mortal view’s in the unexplored and unexplorable regions
of immensity.

Here, then, we are presented with a scene which gives us a display
of _Omnipotent Power_ which no other objects can unfold, and which,
without the aid of the telescope, we should never have beheld--a
scene which expands our conceptions of the Divine Being, to an extent
which the men of former generations could never have anticipated--a
scene which enables us to form an approximate idea of Him who is the
“King Eternal, Immortal, and Invisible,” who “created all worlds, and
for whose pleasure they are, and were created.” Here we behold the
operations of a Being whose power is illimitable and uncontrollable,
and which far transcends the comprehension of the highest created
intelligences--a power, displayed not only in the vast extension of
material existence, and the countless number of mighty globes which
the universe contains--but in the astonishingly _rapid motions_ with
which myriads of them are carried along through the immeasurable spaces
of creation,--some of those magnificent orbs moving with a velocity
of one hundred and seventy thousand miles an hour. Here, likewise, we
have a display of the infinite _Wisdom_ and Intelligence of the Divine
Mind, in the harmony and order with which all the mighty movements of
the universe are conducted--in proportionating the magnitudes, motions
and distances of the planetary worlds--in the nice adjustment of the
projectile velocity to the attractive power--in the constant proportion
between the times of the periodical revolution of the planets and
the cubes of their mean distances--in the _distances_ of the several
planets from the central body of the system, compared with their
respective _densities_--and in the constancy and regularity of their
motions, and the exactness with which they accomplish their destined
rounds--all which circumstances evidently show that He who contrived
the universe is “the only Wise God,” who is “wonderful in counsel
and excellent in working.” Here, in fine, is a display of _boundless
benevolence_. For we cannot suppose, for a moment, that so many myriads
of magnificent globes, fitted to be the centres of a countless number
of mighty worlds, should be nothing else than barren wastes, without
the least relation to intelligent existence. And if they are peopled
with intellectual beings of various orders--how vast must be their
numbers, and how overflowing that Divine Beneficence which has provided
for them all, every thing requisite to their existence and happiness!

In these discoveries of the telescope, we obtain a glimpse of the
grandeur and the unlimited extent of God’s universal empire. To this
empire no boundaries can be perceived. The larger, and the more
powerful our telescopes are, the further are we enabled to penetrate
into those distant and unknown regions; and however far we penetrate
into the abyss of space, new objects of wonder and magnificence still
continue rising to our view--affording the strongest presumption,
that were we to penetrate ten thousand times farther into those
remote spaces of immensity, new suns, and systems, and worlds would
be disclosed to our view. Over all this vast assemblage of material
existence, and over all the sensitive and intellectual beings it
contains, God eternally and unchangably presides; and the minutest
movements, either of the physical or the intelligent system, throughout
every department of those vast dominions, are at every moment “naked
and open” to his Omniscient eye. What _boundless Intelligence_ is
implied in the _Superintendence_ and _arrangement_ of the affairs of
such an unlimited empire! and what a lofty and expansive idea does it
convey of Him who sits on the throne of Universal Nature, and whose
greatness is unsearchable! But without the aids of the telescopic tube,
we could not have formed such ample conceptions of the greatness,
either of the Eternal Creator himself, or of the universe which he hath
brought into existence.

Besides the above, the following uses of the telescope, in relation to
science and common life, may be shortly noticed:--

In the business of astronomy, scarcely any thing can be done with
accuracy without the assistance of the telescope. 1. It enables the
astronomer to determine with precision _the transits of the planets
and stars_, across the meridian; and on the accuracy with which
these transits are obtained, a variety of important conclusions and
calculations depend. The computation of astronomical and nautical
tables for aiding the navigator in his voyages round the globe, and
facilitating his calculations of latitude and longitude, is derived
from observations made by the telescope, without the use of which
instrument, they cannot be made with precision. 2. The _apparent
diameters of the planets_ can only be measured by means of this
instrument, furnished with a micrometer. By the naked eye no accurate
measurements of the diameters of these bodies can be taken; and
without knowing their apparent diameters, in minutes or seconds, their
real bulk cannot be determined, even although their exact distances
be known. The differences, too, between their polar and equatorial
diameters cannot be ascertained without observations made by powerful
telescopes. For example, the equatorial diameter of Jupiter is found
to be in proportion to the polar as 14 to 13, that is, the equatorial
is more than 6000 miles longer than the polar diameter, which could
never have been determined by observations made by the naked eye.
3. The _parallaxes_ of the heavenly bodies can only be accurately
ascertained by the telescope; and it is only from the knowledge of
their parallaxes, that their distances from the earth or from the
sun can be determined. In the case of the fixed stars, nothing of
the nature of a parallax could ever be expected to be found without
the aid of a telescope. It was by searching for the parallax of a
certain fixed star, that the important fact of the _Aberration of
light_ was discovered. The observations, for this purpose, were made
by means of a telescope 24 feet long, fixed in a certain position. 4.
The motions and revolutionary periods of _Sidereal systems_, can only
be determined by observations made by telescopes of great magnifying
and illuminating powers. Without a telescope the small stars which
accompany double or treble stars cannot be perceived, and much less
their motions or variation of their relative positions. Before the
invention of the telescope such phenomena--now deemed so wonderful
and interesting--could never have been surmised. 5. The accurate
determination of the longitude of places on the earth’s surface is
ascertained by the telescope, by observing with this instrument the
immersions and emersions of the satellites of Jupiter. From such
observations, with the aid of a chronometer, and having the time at any
known place, the situation of any unknown place is easily determined.
But the eclipses of Jupiter’s moons can be perceived only by telescopic
instruments of considerable power. 6. By means of a telescope, with
cross hairs in the focus of the eye-glass, and attached to a Quadrant,
the altitude of the sun or of a star, particularly the pole-star, may
be most accurately taken; and, from such observations, the _latitude_
of the place may be readily and accurately deduced.

Again, in the _Surveying of land_, the telescope is particularly
useful; and for this purpose it is mounted on a stand with a horizontal
and vertical motion, pointing out by divisions the degrees and minutes
of inclination of the instrument. For the more accurate reading
of these divisions, the two limbs are furnished with a Nonius, or
_Vernier’s scale_. The object here is to take the angular distances
between distant objects on a plane truly horizontal; or else the
angular elevation or depression of objects above or below the plane
of the horizon. In order to obtain either of those kinds of angles to
a requisite degree of exactness, it is necessary that the surveyor
should have as clear and distinct a view as possible of the objects,
or station-staves, which he fixes up for his purpose, that he may
with the greater certainty determine the point of the object which
exactly corresponds with the line he is taking. Now, as such objects
are generally at too great a distance for the surveyor to be able
to distinguish with the naked eye, he takes the assistance of the
telescope, by which he obtains, 1. A distinct view of the object to
which his attention is directed, and 2. he is enabled to determine the
precise point of the object aimed at, by means of the cross hairs in
the focus of the eye-glass. A telescope mounted for this purpose is
called a _Theodolite_, which is derived from two Greek words θεομαι _to
see_, and οδος, _the way_ or _distance_.

In the next place, the telescope is an instrument of special
importance, in the conducting of _Telegraphs_, and in the conveyance
of _signals_ of all descriptions. Without its assistance telegraphic
dispatches could not be conveyed with accuracy to any considerable
distance, nor in quadruple the time in which they are now communicated,
and the different stations would need to be exceedingly numerous. But
by the assistance of the telescope information may be communicated, by
a series of telegraphs, with great rapidity. Twenty-seven telegraphs
convey information from Paris to Calais--a distance of 160 miles--in 3
minutes; twenty-two from Paris to Lisle in 2 minutes; forty-six from
Strasburg to Paris in 4-1/2 minutes; and eighty from Paris to Brest
in 10 minutes. In many other cases which occur both on land and on
sea, the telescope is essentially requisite for descrying signals.
The _Bell-Rock Light House_, for example, is situated 12 miles from
Arbroath, and from every other portion of land, so that the naked eye
could not discern any signal which the keepers of that light could have
it in their power to make; but by means of a large telescope in the
station-house in Arbroath, the hoisting of a ball every morning at 9
A.M.--which indicates that ‘All is well’--may be distinctly
recognised.

Many other uses of this instrument, in the ordinary transactions of
life, will readily occur to the reader; and therefore I shall only
mention the following purpose to which it may be applied, namely,--

_To measure the distance of an object from one station._ This depends
upon the increase of the focal distance of the telescope in the case
of near objects. Look through a telescope at the object whose distance
is required, and adjust the focus till it appear quite distinct;
then slide in the drawer, till the object begins to be obscure, and
mark that place of the tube precisely. Next draw out the tube till
the object begins to be again obscured, and then make another mark
as before. Then take the middle point between these two marks, and
that will be the point where the image of the object is formed most
distinctly; which is to be nicely measured from the object lens, and
compared with the solar focus of the lens or telescope, so as to
ascertain their difference. And the rule for finding the distance
is,--‘As the difference between the focal distance of the object, and
the solar focal distance : Is to the solar focal distance :: So is the
focal distance of the object : To its true distance from the object
lens.’ An example will render this matter more perspicuous.

[Illustration: _figure 84._]

Let AB (fig. 84.) be the object lens, EY the eye-glass, FC the radius,
or focus of the lens AB, and C_f_ the focal distance of the object OB,
whose distance is to be measured. Now suppose CF = 48 inches, or 4
feet, and that we find by the above method that C_f_ is 50 inches, then
F_f_ is 2 inches; and the analogy is:--As F_f_ = 2, is to CF = 48, so
is C_f_ = 50, to CQ = 1200 inches, or 100 feet. Again, suppose C_f_ =
49 inches, then will F_f_ = 1 inch; and the proportion is, 1 : 48 :: 49
: 2352 = QC, or 196 feet. A telescope of this focal length, however,
will measure only small distances. But, suppose AB a lens whose solar
focus is 12 feet, or 144 inches; and that we find, by the above method,
that C_f_, or the focal distance of the object, is 146 inches; then
will F_f_ be 2 inches, and the proportion will be, as 2 : 144 :: 146
: 21024 inches, or 1752 feet = the distance QC. If with such a large
telescope, we view an object OB, and find F_f_ but 1/10th of an inch,
this will give the distance of the object as 17292 feet or nearly 3-1/3
miles.

Since the difference between the radius of the object lens and the
focal distance of the object is so considerable as 2 inches in a tube
of 4 feet, and more than 12 inches in one of 12 feet, a method might
be contrived for determining the distance of near objects by the
former, and more distant objects by the latter, by inspection only.
This may be done by adjusting or drawing a spiral line round the drawer
or tube, through the _two inch space_ in the small telescope, and by
calculation, graduate it for every 100 feet, and the intermediate
inches, and then, at the same time we view an object, we may see its
distance on the tube. In making such experiments, a common object-glass
of a long focal length, and a single eye-glass, are all that is
requisite; since the inverted appearance of the object can cause no
great inconveniency.




CHAPTER VII.


ON THE METHOD OF GRINDING AND POLISHING OPTICAL LENSES AND SPECULA.

I originally intended to enter into particular details on this subject,
for the purpose of gratifying those mechanics and others who wish
to amuse themselves by constructing telescopes and other optical
instruments for their own use; but, having dwelt so long on the subject
of telescopes, in the preceding pages, I am constrained to confine
myself to a very general sketch.

1. _To grind and polish lenses for eye-glasses, microscopes, &c._

First provide an upright spindle, at the bottom of which a pulley is
fixed, which must be turned by a wheel by means of a cord and handle.
At the top of the spindle make a screw the same as a lathe-spindle, on
which you may screw chocks of different sizes, to which the brass tool
in which the lens is to be ground, may be fixed. Having fixed upon the
breadth and focal length of the lens, and whether it is to be a plano,
or a double convex--take a piece of tin-plate or sheet copper, and,
with a pair of compasses, draw an arch upon its surface, near one of
its extremities, with a radius equal to the focal distance of the lens,
if intended to be double convex, or with half that distance, if it is
to be plano-convex. Remove with a file that part of the copper which
is without the circular arch, and then a _convex_ gage is formed. With
the same radius strike another arch, and having removed that part of
the copper which is _within_ it, a _concave_ gage will be obtained. The
brass tool, in which the glass is to be ground, is then to be fixed
upon a turning-lathe, and turned into a portion of a concave sphere,
so as to correspond to the convex gage. In order to obtain an accurate
figure to the concave tool, a convex tool of exactly the same radius
is generally formed, and they are ground one upon another with flour
emery; and when they exactly coincide, they are fit for use. The convex
tool will serve for grinding _concave_ glasses of the same radius--and
it should be occasionally ground in the concave tool to prevent it from
altering its figure.

The next thing to be attended to is, to prepare the piece of glass
which is to be ground, by chipping it in a circular shape, by means
of a large pair of scissors, and removing the roughness from its
edges by a common grind-stone. The faces of the glass near the edges
should likewise be ground on the grind-stone, till they nearly fit
the concave gage, by which the labour of grinding in the tool will be
considerably saved. The next thing required is to prepare the emery for
grinding, which is done in the following manner. Provide four or five
clean earthen vessels; fill one of them with water, and put into it a
pound or half a pound of fine emery, and stir it about with a stick;
after which let it stand 3 or 4 seconds, and then pour it into another
vessel, which may stand about 10 seconds; then pour it off again into
the several vessels till the water is quite clear; and by this means,
emery of different degrees of fineness is obtained, which must be kept
separate from each other, and worked in their proper order, beginning
at the first, and working off all the marks of the grind-stone; then
take of the second, next of the third, &c.,--holding the glass upon
the pan or tool with a light hand, when it comes to be nearly fit
for polishing. The glass in this operation should be cemented to a
wooden handle, by means of pitch or other strong cement. After the
finest emery has been used, the roughness which remains may be taken
away, and a slight polish given by grinding the glass with pounded
pumice-stone. Before proceeding to the polishing, the glass should be
ground as smooth as possible, and all the scratches erased, otherwise
the polishing will become a tedious process. The polishing is performed
as follows: Tie a piece of linen rag or of fine cloth about the tool,
and with fine putty, (calcined tin), or colcothar of vitriol (a very
fine powder, sometimes called the red oxide of iron) moistened with
water, continue the grinding motion, and in a short time there will be
an excellent polish.

In order to grind lenses very accurately for the finest optical
purposes, particularly object-glasses for telescopes--the concave tool
is firmly fixed to a table or bench, and the glass wrought upon it by
the hand with circular strokes so that its centre may never go beyond
the edges of the tool. For every 6 or 7 circular strokes, the glass
should receive 2 or 3 cross ones along the diameter of the tool, and in
different directions; and while the operation is going on, the convex
tool should, at the end of five minutes, be wrought upon the concave
one for a few seconds, in order to preserve the same curvature to the
tools and to the glass. The finest polish is generally given in the
following way. Cover the concave tool with a layer of pitch hardened
by the addition of a little rosin, to the thickness of 1/15th of an
inch. Then, having taken a piece of thin writing paper, press it upon
the surface of the pitch with the convex tool, and pull the paper
quickly from the pitch before it has adhered to it; and if the surface
of the pitch is marked every where with the lines of the paper, it
will be truly spherical. If any paper remains on the surface of the
pitch, it may be rubbed off by soap and water, and if the marks of
the paper should not appear on any part of it, the operation must be
repeated, till the polisher or bed of pitch is accurately spherical.
The glass is then to be wrought on the polisher by circular and cross
strokes with the putty or colcothar, till it has received a complete
polish. When one side is finished, the glass must be separated from its
handle, by inserting the point of a knife between it and the pitch,
and giving it a gentle stroke. The pitch which remains upon the glass
may be removed by rubbing it with a little oil or spirits of wine. The
operation of polishing on cloth is slower, and the polish less perfect
than on pitch; but it is a mode best fitted for those who have little
experience, and who would be apt, in the first instance, to injure the
figure of the lens by polishing it on a bed of pitch.

2. _On the method of casting and grinding the Specula of Reflecting
Telescopes._

The first thing to be considered in the formation of reflecting
telescopes, is the _composition_ of the metal of which the specula
are made. The qualities required are--a sound uniform metal, free
from all microscopic pores--not liable to tarnish by absorption of
moisture from the atmosphere--not so hard as to be incapable of taking
a good figure and polish--nor so soft as to be easily scratched, and
possessing a high reflecting power. Various compositions have been
used for this purpose, of which the following are specimens:--Take
good Swedish copper 32 ounces, and when melted, add 14-1/2 ounces of
grain tin to it; then, having taken off the scoria, cast it into an
ingot. This metal must be a second time melted to cast a speculum; but
it will fuse in this compound state with a small heat, and therefore
will not calcine the tin to putty. It should be poured off as soon as
it is melted, giving it no more heat than is absolutely necessary. The
best method for giving the melted metal a good surface is this: the
moment before it is poured off, throw into the crucible a spoonful of
charcoal-dust; immediately after which the metal must be stirred with
a wooden spatula and poured into the moulds.--The following is another
composition somewhat similar. Take 2 parts copper as pure as it is
possible to procure; this must be melted in a crucible by itself. Then
put, in another crucible, 1 part of pure grain tin. When they are both
melted, mix and stir them with a wooden spatula, keeping a good flux
on the melted surface to prevent oxidation, and then pour the metal
quickly into the moulds, which may be made of founder’s loam.

The composition suggested, more than half a century ago, by the Rev.
Mr. Edwards, has often been referred to with peculiar approbation. This
gentleman took a great deal of pains to discover the best composition,
and to give his metals a fine polish and the true parabolical figure.
His telescopes were tried by Dr. Maskelyne, the Astronomer Royal, who
found them greatly to excel in brightness, and to equal in other
respects those made by the best artists. They showed a white object
perfectly white, and all objects of their proper colour. He found,
after trying various combinations, the following to be the best: namely
32 ounces of copper, with 15 or 16 ounces of grain tin, (according to
the purity of the copper) with the addition of one ounce of brass,
one of silver, and one ounce of arsenic. This, he affirms, will form
a metal capable, when polished in a proper manner, of reflecting more
light than any other metal yet made public.

The Rev. J. Little, in his observations on this subject in the ‘Irish
Transactions,’ proposes the following composition, which he found to
answer the purpose better than any he had tried, namely--32 parts
of best bar copper, previously fluxed with the black flux, of two
parts tartar and one of nitre, 4 parts brass, 16 parts tin, and 1-1/4
arsenic. If the metal be granulated, by pouring it, when first melted,
into water, and then fused a second time, it will be less porous than
at first. In this process, the chief object is, to hit on the exact
point of the saturation of the copper, &c., by the tin. For, if the
latter be added in too great quantity, the metal will be dull coloured
and soft; if too little, it will not attain the most perfect whiteness,
and will certainly tarnish.[35]

When the metal is cast, and prepared by the common grind-stone for
receiving its proper figure--the gages and grinding-tools are to be
formed in the same manner as formerly described for lenses, with this
difference, that the radius of the gages must always be _double_
the focal length of the speculum, as the focus of parallel rays by
reflection is at one half the radius of concavity. In addition to the
concave and convex tools--which should be only a little broader than
the metal itself--a convex elliptical tool of lead and tin should
be formed with the same radius, so that its transverse should be to
its conjugate diameter as 10 to 9, the latter being exactly equal to
the diameter of the metal. The grinding of the speculum is then to
be commenced, on this tool, with coarse emery powder and water, when
the roughness is taken off, by moving the speculum across the tool,
in different directions, walking round the post on which the tool
is fixed, holding the speculum by the wooden handle to which it is
cemented. It is then to be wrought with great care on the convex brass
tool, with circular and cross strokes, and with emery of different
degrees--the concave tool being sometimes ground upon the convex one,
to keep them all of the same radius, and when every scratch is removed
from its surface, it will be fit for receiving the final polish.

When the metal is ready for polishing, the elliptical tool is to
be covered with black pitch about 1/20th of an inch thick, and the
polisher formed in the same way as in the case of lenses, either with
the concave brass tool or with the metal itself. The colcothar of
vitriol should then be triturated between two surfaces of glass, and
a considerable quantity of it applied at first to the surface of the
polisher. The speculum is then to be wrought, in the usual way, upon
the polishing tool, till it has received a brilliant lustre, taking
care to use no more of the colcothar, if it can be avoided, and only a
small quantity of it, if it should be found necessary. When the metal
moves stiffly on the polisher, and the colcothar assumes a dark muddy
hue, the polish advances with great rapidity. The tool will then grow
warm, and would probably stick to the speculum, if its motion were
discontinued for a moment. At this stage of the process, therefore, we
must proceed with great caution, breathing continually on the polisher,
till the friction is so great, as to retard the motion of the speculum.
When this happens, the metal is to be slipped off the tool at one side,
cleaned with soft leather, and placed in a tube for the purpose of
trying its performance; and if the polishing has been conducted with
care, it will be found to have a true _parabolic_ figure.[36]

It was formerly the practice, before the speculum was brought to the
polisher, to smooth it on a _bed of hones_, or a convex tool made of
the best blue stone, such as clockmakers use in polishing their work,
which was made one fourth part larger than the metal which was to be
ground upon it, and turned as true as possible to a gage. But this tool
is not generally considered as absolutely necessary, except when silver
and brass enter into the composition of the metal, in order to remove
the roughness which remains after grinding with the emery.

_To try the figure of the metal._--In order to this, the speculum must
be placed in the tube of the telescope for which it is intended; and,
at about 20 or 30 yards distant, there should be put up a watch-paper,
or similar object, on which there are some very fine strokes of an
engraver. An annular kind of diagram should be made with card-paper,
so as to cover a circular portion of the middle part of the speculum,
between the hole and the circumference, equal in breadth to about
1/8 of its diameter. This paper ring should be fixed in the mouth
of the telescope, and remain so during the whole experiment. There
must likewise be two other circular pieces of card-paper cut out, of
such sizes, that one may cover the centre of the metal, by completely
filling the hole in the annular piece now described: and the other such
a round piece as shall exactly fill the tube, and so broad as that
the inner edge just touches the outward circumference of the middle
annular piece. All these pieces together will completely shut up the
mouth of the telescope. Let the round piece which covers the centre of
the metal be removed, and adjust the instrument so that the image may
be as sharp and distinct as possible. Then replace the central piece,
and remove the outside annular one, by which means the circumference
only of the speculum will be exposed; and the image now formed will be
from the rays reflected from the exterior side of the metal. If the two
images formed by these two portions of the metal be perfectly sharp and
equally distinct, the speculum is perfect and of the true parabolic
curve. If, on the contrary, the image from the outside of the metal
should not be distinct and that it should be necessary to bring the
little speculum _nearer_ by the screw, the metal is not yet brought to
the parabolic figure; but if, in order to procure distinctness, we be
obliged to move the small speculum farther off, then the figure of the
great speculum has been carried beyond the parabolic, and has assumed
the hyperbolic form.

_To adjust the eye-hole of Gregorian Reflectors._--If there is only
one eye-glass, then the distance of the small hole should be as nearly
as possible equal to its focal length. But in the compound Huygenian
eye-piece, the distance of the eye-hole may be thus found:--Multiply
the difference between the focal distance of the glass next to the
speculum, and the distance of the two eye-glasses, by the focal
distance of the glass nearest the eye; divide the product by the sum
of the focal distances of the two lenses, lessened by their distance,
and the quotient will be the compound focal distance required. Thus,
if the focal distance of the lens next the speculum be 3 inches, that
of the lens next the eye 1 inch, and their distance 2 inches, then the
compound focal distance from the eye-glass will be (3 - 2 × 1)/(3 × 1
- 2) = 1/2 inch.--The _diameter_ of the eye-hole is always equal to
the quotient obtained by dividing the diameter of the great speculum
by the magnifying power of the telescope. It is generally from 1/25th
to 1/50th of an inch in diameter. It is necessary, in many cases, to
obtain, _from direct experiment_, an accurate determination of the
place and size of the eye-hole, as on this circumstance depends, in a
certain degree, the accurate performance of the instrument.

_To center the two specula of Gregorian Reflectors._--Extend two fine
threads or wires across the aperture of the tube at right angles, so as
to intersect each other, exactly in the axis of the telescope. Before
the arm is finally fastened to the slider, place it in the tube, and
through the eye-piece (without glasses) the intersection of the cross
wires must be seen exactly in the centre of the hole of the arm. When
this exactness is obtained, let the arm be firmly riveted and soldered
to the slider.

_To centre lenses._--The centering of lenses is of great importance,
more especially for the object-glasses of achromatic instruments. The
following is reckoned a good method:--Let the lens to be centered be
cemented on a brass chuck, having the middle turned away so as not to
touch the lens, but near the edge, which will be hid when mounted. This
rim is very accurately turned flat where it is to touch the glass. When
the chuck and cement is warm it is made to revolve rapidly: while in
motion a lighted candle is brought before it, and its reflected image
attentively watched. If this image has any motion, the lens is not
flat or central; a piece of soft wood must therefore be applied to it
in the manner of a turning tool, till such time as the light becomes
stationary. When the whole has cooled, the edges of the lens must be
turned by a diamond, or ground with emery.

specula and lenses, the reader is referred to Smith’s ‘Complete system
of Optics’--Imison’s ‘School of Arts’--_Huygenii Opera_--Brewster’s

PART III.

ON VARIOUS ASTRONOMICAL INSTRUMENTS.




CHAPTER I.


ON MICROMETERS.

A micrometer is an instrument attached to a telescope, in order to
measure small spaces in the heavens, such as the spaces between two
stars, and the diameters of the sun, moon and planets--and by the
help of which the _apparent magnitude_ of all objects viewed through
telescopes may be measured with great exactness.

There are various descriptions of these instruments, constructed with
different substances, and in various forms, of which the following
constitute the principal variety. The _Wire_ micrometer--the _Spider’s
line_ micrometer--the Polymetric reticle--Divided _object glass_
micrometer--Divided _eye-glass_ micrometer--Ramsden’s _Catoptric_
micrometer--Rochon’s _crystal_ micrometer--Maskelyne’s _Prismatic_
micrometer--Brewster’s _micrometrical telescope_--Sir W. Herschel’s
_Lamp_ micrometer--Cavallo’s _Mother of Pearl_ micrometer, and several
others. But, instead of attempting even a general description of
these instruments, I shall confine myself merely to a very brief
description of _Cavallo’s Micrometer_, as its construction will be
easily understood by the general reader, as it is one of the most
simple of these instruments, and is so cheap as to be procured for
a few shillings; while some of the instruments now mentioned are so
expensive, as to cost nearly as much as a tolerably good telescope.[37]

This micrometer consists of a thin and narrow slip of mother of pearl
finely divided, which is placed in the focus of the eye-glass of a
telescope, just where the image of the object is formed; and it may be
applied either to a reflecting or a refracting telescope, provided the
eye-glass be a convex lens. It is about the 20th part of an inch broad,
and of the thickness of common writing paper, divided into equal parts
by parallel lines, every fifth and tenth of which is a little longer
than the rest. The simplest way of fixing it is to stick it upon the
diaphragm which generally stands within the tube, and in the focus of
the eye-glass. When thus fixed, if you look through the eye-glass, the
divisions of the micrometrical scale will appear very distinct, unless
the diaphragm is not exactly in the focus of the eye-glass, in which
case it must be moved to the proper place;--or, the micrometer may be
placed exactly in the focus of the eye-lens by the interposition of a
circular piece of paper, card, or by means of wax. If a person should
not like to see always the micrometer in the field of the telescope,
then the micrometrical scale, instead of being fixed to the diaphragm,
may be fitted to a circular perforated plate of brass, of wood, or even
of paper, which may be occasionally placed upon the said diaphragm. One
of these micrometers, in my possession, which contains 600 divisions in
an inch, is fitted up in a separate eye-tube, with a glass peculiar to
itself, which slides into the eye-piece of the telescope, when its own
proper glass is taken out.

_To ascertain the value of the divisions of this micrometer._--Direct
the telescope to the sun, and observe how many divisions of the
micrometer measure its diameter exactly. Then take out of the Nautical
Almanack the diameter of the sun for the day on which the observation
is made. Divide it by the above-mentioned number of divisions, and the
quotient is the value of one division of the micrometer. Thus, suppose
that 26-1/2 divisions of the micrometer measure the diameter of the
sun, and that the Nautical Almanack gives for the measure of the same
diameter 31´: 22´´, or 1882´´. Divide 1882 by 26.5, and the quotient is
71´´ or 1´: 11´´, which is the value of one division of the micrometer;
the double of which is the value of two divisions, and so on. The value
of the divisions may likewise be ascertained by the passage of an
equatorial star over a certain number of divisions in a certain time.
The stars best situated for this purpose are such as the following--δ
in the Whale, R. A. 37°: 3-1/3´, Dec. 37´: 50´´ S; δ in Orion, R. A.
80°: 11´: 42´´, Dec. 28´: 40´´ S; υ in the Lion, R. A. 171°: 25´: 21´´,
Dec. 23´: 22´´ N.; η in Virgo R. A. 182°: 10´, Dec. 33´: 27´´ N. But
the following is the most easy and accurate method of determining the
value of the divisions:--

Mark upon a wall or other place the length of _six inches_, which may
be done by making two dots or lines six inches asunder, or by fixing
a six inch ruler upon a stand. Then place the telescope before it,
so that the ruler or six-inch length may be at right angles with the
direction of the telescope, and just 57 feet 3-1/2 inches distant
from the object-glass of the telescope; this done, look through the
telescope at the ruler, or other extension of six inches, and observe
how many divisions of the micrometer are equal to it, and that same
number of divisions is equal to half a degree, or 30´; and this is all
that is necessary for the required determination. The reason of which
is, because an extension of six inches subtends an angle of 30´, at the
distance of 57 feet, 3-1/2 inches, as may be easily calculated from the
rules of plane Trigonometry.

[Illustration: _figure 85._]

Fig. 85, exhibits this micrometer scale, but shows it four times larger
than the real size of one which was adapted to a 3 feet achromatic
telescope magnifying 84 times. The divisions upon it are the 200ths of
an inch, which reach from one edge of the scale to about the middle of
it, excepting every fifth and tenth division, which are longer. Two
divisions of this scale are very nearly equal to one minute; and as a
quarter of one of these divisions may be distinguished by estimation,
therefore an angle of 1/8 of a minute, or of 7-1/2´´ may be measured
with it. When a telescope magnifies more, the divisions of the
micrometer must be more minute. When the focus of the eye-glass of the
telescope is shorter than half an inch, the micrometer may be divided
with the 500ths of an inch; by means of which, and the telescope
magnifying about 200 times, one may easily and accurately measure an
angle smaller than half a second. On the other hand, when the telescope
does not magnify above 30 times, the divisions need not be so minute.
In one of Dollond’s pocket telescopes, which, when drawn out for use
is only 14 inches long, a micrometer with the hundredths of an inch
is quite sufficient, and one of its divisions is equal to little less
than 3 minutes, so that an angle of a minute may be measured by it.
Supposing 11-1/2 of those divisions equal to 30´ or 23 to a degree--any
other angle measured by any other number of divisions, is determined
by proportion. Thus, suppose the diameter of the sun, seen through the
same telescope, be found equal to 12 divisions, say As 11-1/2 divisions
: are to 30 minutes :: so are 12 divisions : to ((12 × 30)/11.5) 31.3,
which is the required diameter of the sun.

_Practical uses of this Micrometer._--This micrometer may be applied
to the following purposes:--1. For measuring the apparent diameters of
the sun, moon, and planets. 2. For measuring the apparent distances of
the satellites from their primaries. 3. For measuring the cusps of the
moon in eclipses. 4. For measuring the apparent distances between two
contiguous stars--between a star and a planet--between a star and the
moon--or between a comet and the contiguous stars, so as to determine
its path. 5. For finding the difference of declination of contiguous
stars, when they have nearly the same R. Ascension. 6. For measuring
the small elevations or depressions of objects above and below the
horizon. 7. For measuring the proportional parts of buildings, and
other objects in perspective drawing. 8. For ascertaining whether a
ship at sea, or any moving object is coming nearer or going farther
off; for if the angle subtended by the object appears to increase,
it shows that the object is coming nearer, and if the angle appears
to decrease, it indicates that the object is receding from us. 9.
For ascertaining the real distances of objects of known extension,
and hence to measure heights, depths, and horizontal distances. 10.
For measuring the real extensions of objects when their distances
are known. 11. For measuring the distance and size of an object when
neither of them is known.

When the micrometer is adapted to those telescopes which have four
glasses in the eye-tube--and _when the eye-tube only is used_, it
may be applied to the following purposes:--1. For measuring the
real or lineal dimensions of small objects, instead of the angles.
For if the tube be unscrewed from the rest of the telescope, and
applied to small objects, it will serve for a microscope, having a
considerable magnifying power, as we have already shown, (p. 348);
and the micrometer, in that case, will measure the lineal dimensions
of the object, as the diameter of a hair, the length of a flea, or
the limbs of an insect. In order to find the value of the divisions
for this purpose, we need only apply a ruler, divided into tenths
of an inch, to the end of the tube, and, looking through the tube,
observe how many divisions of the micrometer measure one tenth of an
inch on the ruler, which will give the required value. Thus, if 30
divisions are equal to 1/10th of an inch, 300 of them must be equal
to 1 inch, and one division is equal to the 300dth part of an inch.
2. For measuring the magnifying power of other telescopes. This is
done by measuring the diameter of the pencil of light at the eye-end
of the telescope in question. For, if we divide the diameter of the
object lens by the diameter of this pencil of light, the quotient will
express how many times that telescope magnifies in diameter. Thus,
suppose that 300 divisions of the micrometer are equal to the apparent
extension of 1 inch--that the pencil of light is measured by 4 of these
divisions--and that the diameter of the object lens measures 1 inch
and 2 tenths:--Multiply 1.2 by 300, and the product 360, divided by 4,
gives 90 for the magnifying power of the telescope.

_Problems which may be solved by this micrometer._ I. The angle--not
exceeding one degree--which is subtended by an extension of 1 foot,
being given, to find its distance from the place of observation:--Rule
1. If the angle be expressed in minutes, say, as the given angle :
is to 60 :: so is 687.55 : to a fourth proportional, which gives the
answer in inches. 2. If the angle be expressed in seconds, say, As the
given angle : is to 3600 :: so is 687.55 to a fourth proportional,
which expresses the answer in inches. 3. If the angle be expressed in
minutes and seconds, turn it all into seconds, and proceed as above.
Example, at what distance is a globe of 1 foot in diameter, when it
subtends an angle of 2 seconds? 2 : 3600 :: 687.55 : (3600 × 687.55)/2
= 1237596 inches, or 103132-1/2 feet = the answer required. II. The
angle which is subtended by any known extension being given, to find
its distance from the place of observation. Rule, Proceed as if the
extension were of one foot, by Problem I, and call the answer B; then
if the extension in question be expressed in inches, say, as 12 inches
: are to that extension :: so is B : to a fourth proportional, which
is the answer in inches. But if the extension in question be expressed
in feet, then we need only multiply it by B, and the product is the
answer in inches.--Example, At what distance is a man 6 feet high, when
he appears to subtend an angle of 30´´? By Problem I, if the man were
1 foot high, the distance would be 82506 inches; but as he is 6 feet
high, therefore multiply 82506 by 6, and the product is the required
distance, namely 495036 inches, or 41253 feet.

For greater conveniency, especially in travelling, when one has not
the opportunity of making such calculations, the following two tables
have been calculated; the first of which shows the distance answering
to any angle from one minute to one degree, which is subtended by a
man whose height is considered an extension of 6 feet, because at a
mean, such is the height of a man when dressed with hat and shoes on.
These tables may be transcribed on a card, and may be kept always ready
with a pocket telescope furnished with a micrometer. Their use is to
ascertain distances without any calculations; and they are calculated
only to minutes, because with a pocket telescope and micrometer, it
is not possible to measure an angle more accurately than to a minute.
Thus, if we want to measure the extension of a street, let a foot ruler
be placed at the end of the street; measure the angular appearance of
it, which suppose to be 36´, and in the table we have the required
distance against 36´, which is 95-1/2 feet. Thus also a man who appears
to be 49´ high, is at the distance of 421 feet. Again, Suppose the
trunk of a tree which is known to be 3 feet in diameter be observed to
subtend an angle of 9´-1/2. Take the number answering to 9´ out of the
table, namely 382, and subtract from it a proportional part for the
half minute, namely 19.1, which subtracted from 382, leaves 362.9. This
multiplied by 3, the diameter of the tree, produces 1087.7 feet = the
distance from the object end of the telescope.

In this way the distance of a considerably remote object, as a town
or building at 10 or 12 miles distant, may be very nearly determined;
provided we have the lineal dimensions of a house or other object that
stands at right angles to the line of vision. The breadth of a river,
of an arm of the sea, or the distance of a light house, whose elevation
above the sea or any other point, is known, may likewise in this manner
be easily determined.




CHAPTER II.


ON THE EQUATORIAL TELESCOPE, OR PORTABLE OBSERVATORY.

The equatorial instrument is intended to answer a number of useful
purposes in Practical Astronomy, independently of any particular
observatory. Besides answering the general purpose of a Quadrant, a
Transit instrument, a Theodolite, and an Azimuth instrument--it is
almost the only instrument adapted for viewing the stars and planets
_in the day-time_, and for following them in their apparent diurnal
motions. It may be made use of in any steady room or place, and
performs most of the useful problems in astronomical science.

The basis of all equatorial instruments is a revolving axis, placed
parallel to the axis of the earth, by which an attached telescope is
made to follow a star or other celestial body in the arc of its diurnal
revolution, without the trouble of repeated adjustments for changes of
elevation, which quadrants and circles with vertical and horizontal
axes require. Such an instrument is not only convenient for many useful
and interesting purposes in celestial observations, but is essentially
requisite in certain cases, particularly in examining and measuring the
relative positions of two contiguous bodies, or in determining the
diameters of the planets, when the spider’s-line micrometer is used.

Christopher Scheiner is supposed to have been the first astronomer who,
in the year 1620, made use of a polar axis, but without any appendage
of graduated circles. It was not, however, till the middle of the
last century, that any instruments of this description, worthy of the
name, were attempted to be constructed. In 1741, Mr. Henry Hindley, a
clock-maker in York, added to the polar axis, an equatorial plate, a
quadrant of altitude, and declination semicircle; but when this piece
of mechanism was sent to London for sale in 1748, it remained unsold
for the space of 13 years. Mr. Short, the optician, published in the
Philosophical Transactions, for 1750, a ‘description of an equatorial
telescope,’ which was of the reflecting kind, and was mounted over a
combination of circles and semicircles, which were strong enough to
support a tube, and a speculum of the Gregorian construction 18 inches
in focal length. This instrument consisted of a somewhat cumbersome
and expensive piece of machinery--a representation of which may be
seen in volume III of Martin’s ‘_Philosophia Britannica_, or system of
the Newtonian philosophy.’ Various modifications of this instrument
have since been made by Nairne, Dollond, Ramsden, Troughton, and
other artists; but even at the present period, it has never come into
very general use, though it is one of the most pleasant and useful
instruments connected with astronomical observations.

As many of these instruments are somewhat complicated, and very
expensive, I shall direct the attention of the reader solely to
one which I consider as the most simple--which may be purchased
at a moderate expence, and is sufficiently accurate for _general_
observations.

[Illustration: _figure 86._]

This instrument consists of the following parts: A _horizontal circle_
EF (fig. 86.) divided into four quadrants of 90 degrees each. There is
a fixed nonius at N; and the circle is capable of being turned round
on an axis. In the centre of the horizontal circle is fixed a strong
upright pillar, which supports the centre of a vertical semicircle
AB, divided into two quadrants of 90 degrees each. This is called the
_semicircle of altitude_, and may, at any time, serve the purpose of
a quadrant in measuring either altitudes or depressions. It has a
nonius plate at K. At right angles to the plane of this semicircle, the
_equatorial circle_ MN is firmly fixed. It represents the equator, and
is divided into twice 12 hours, every hour being divided into 12 parts
of 5 minutes each. Upon the equatorial circle moves another circle,
with a chamfered edge, carrying a nonius by which the divisions on
the equatorial may be read off to single minutes; and at right angles
to this moveable circle is fixed the _semicircle of declination_ D,
divided into two quadrants of 90 degrees each. The telescope PO, is
surmounted above this circle, and is fixed to an index moveable on the
semicircle of declination, and carries a nonius opposite to Q. The
telescope is furnished with 2 or 3 Huygenian eye-pieces, and likewise
with a diagonal eye-piece for viewing objects near the zenith. Lastly,
there are 2 spirit levels fixed on the horizontal circle, at right
angles to each other, by means of which this circle is made perfectly
level when observations are to be made.

_To adjust the equatorial for observation._ Set the instrument
on a firm support. Then _to adjust the levels and the horizontal
circle_:--Turn the horizontal circle till the beginning O of the
divisions coincides with the middle stroke of the nonius, or near it.
In this situation one of the levels will be found to lie either in a
right line joining the 2 foot screws which are nearest the nonius, or
else parallel to such a right line. By means of the 2 last screws,
cause the bubble in the level to become stationary in the middle of
the glass; then turn the horizontal circle half round, by bringing
the other O to the nonius; and if the bubble remains in the middle,
as before, the level is well-adjusted; if it does not, correct the
position of the level, by turning one or both of the screws which
pass through its ends, till the bubble has moved half the distance it
ought to come to reach the middle, and cause it to move the other half
by turning the foot-screws already mentioned. Return the horizontal
circle to its first position, and if the adjustments have been well
made, the bubble will remain in the middle: if otherwise, the process
must be repeated till it bears this proof of its accuracy. Then turn
the horizontal circle till 90° stands opposite to the nonius; and by
the foot-screw,immediately opposite the other 90°, cause the bubble of
the same level to stand in the middle of the glass. Lastly, by its own
proper screws set the other level so that its bubble may occupy the
middle of its glass.

_To adjust the line of sight._ Set the nonius on the _declination_
semicircle at O, the nonius on the horary circle at VI, and the nonius
on the semicircle of altitude at 90. Look through the telescope towards
some part of the horizon, where there is a diversity of remote objects.
Level the horizontal circle, and then observe what object appears in
the centre of the cross-wires, or in the centre of the field of view,
if there be no wires. Reverse the semicircle of altitude, so that the
other 90° may apply to the nonius; taking care, at the same time, that
the other three noniuses continue at the same parts of their respective
graduations as before. If the remote object continues to be seen on the
centre of the cross-wires, the line of sight is truly adjusted.

_To find the correction to be applied to observations by the
semicircle of altitude._ Set the nonius on the declination-semicircle
to 0, and the nonius on the horary circle to XII; direct the telescope
to any fixed and distant object, by moving the horizontal circle and
semicircle of altitude, and nothing else; note the degree and minute
of altitude or depression; reverse the declination-semicircle, by
directing the nonius on the horary circle to the opposite XII; direct
the telescope again to the same object, by means of the horizontal
circle and semicircle of altitude, as before. If its altitude or
depression be the same as was observed in the other position, no
correction will be required; but, if otherwise, half the difference of
the two angles is the correction to be added to all observations made
with that quadrant, or half of the semicircle which shows the least
angle, or to be subtracted from all the observations made with the
other quadrant, or half of the semicircle. When the levels and other
adjustments are once truly made, they will be preserved in order for a
length of time, if not deranged by violence; and the correction to be
applied to the semicircle of altitude is a constant quantity.

_Description of the nonius._ The nonius--sometimes called the
_vernier_--is a name given to a device for subdividing the arcs of
quadrants and other astronomical instruments. It depends on the
simple circumstance, that if any line be divided into equal parts,
the length of each part will be greater, the fewer the divisions; and
contrariwise, it will be less in proportion as those divisions are
more numerous. Thus, in the equatorial now described, the distance
between the two extreme strokes on the nonius is exactly equal to 11
degrees on the limb, but that it is divided into 12 equal parts. Each
of these last parts will therefore be shorter than the _degree_ on the
limb in the proportion of 11 to 12, that is to say, it will be 1/12th
part, or 5 minutes shorter. Consequently, if the middle stroke be set
precisely opposite to any degree, the relative positions of the nonius
and the limb must be altered 5 minutes of a degree, before either of
the two adjacent strokes next the middle on the nonius, can be brought
to coincide with the nearest stroke of a degree; and so likewise the
second stroke on the nonius will require a change of 10 minutes, the
third of 15, and so on to 30, when the middle line of the nonius will
be seen to be equi-distant between 2 of the strokes on the limb; after
which the lines on the opposite side of the nonius will coincide in
succession with the strokes on the limb. It is clear from this, that
whenever the middle stroke of the nonius does not stand precisely
opposite to any degree, the odd minutes--or distance between it and
the degree immediately preceding--may be known by the _number_ of the
stroke marked on the nonius, which coincides with any of the strokes on
the limb.[38] In some instruments the nonius-plate has its divisions
fewer than the number of parts on the limb to which it is equal; but
when once a clear idea of the principle of any nonius is obtained, it
will be easy to transfer it to any other mode in which this instrument
is contrived.

_To find by this equatorial the_ MERIDIAN LINE, and the time,
FROM ONE OBSERVATION OF THE SUN. In order to this it is
requisite that the sun’s declination, and the latitude of the place
be known. The declination of the sun may be found, for every day,
in the Nautical Almanack, or any other astronomical Ephemeris; and
the latitude of the place may be found by means of the semicircle of
altitude, when the telescope is directed to the sun or a known fixed
star. It is likewise requisite to make the observation when the azimuth
and altitude of the sun alter quickly; and this is generally the case,
the farther that luminary is from the meridian:--Therefore, at the
distance of 3 or 4 hours, either before or after noon, (in summer)
adjust the horizontal circle; set the semicircle of altitude, so that
its nonius may stand at the co-latitude of the place; lay the plane
of the last-mentioned semicircle in the meridian, by estimation, its
0 being directed towards the depressed pole; place the nonius of the
declination semicircle to the declination, whether north or south. Then
direct the telescope towards the sun, partly by moving the declination
semicircle on the axis of the equatorial circle, and partly by moving
the horizontal circle on its own axis. There is but one position of
these which will admit of the sun being seen exactly in the middle
of the field of view. When this position is obtained, the nonius on
the equatorial circle shows _the apparent time_, and _the circle of
altitude is in the plane of the meridian_. When this position is
ascertained, the meridian may be settled by a land-mark at a distance.

With an equatorial instrument, nearly similar to that now described, I
formerly made a series of ‘_day observations_ on the celestial bodies,’
which were originally published in vol. 36 of ‘Nicholson’s Journal of
Natural Philosophy,’ and which occupy twenty pages of that journal.
Some of these observations I shall lay before the reader, after having
explained the manner in which they are made.

The instrument was made by Messrs. W. and S. Jones, opticians,
Holborn, London. The telescope which originally accompanied the
instrument was an achromatic refractor, its object-glass being 8-1/2
inches focal distance, and one inch diameter. This telescope, not
admitting sufficiently high magnifying powers for the observations
intended, was afterwards thrown aside for another telescope, having an
object-glass 20 inches focal length, and 1-3/4 inch diameter, which was
attached to the equatorial machinery in place of the small telescope.
It was furnished with magnifying powers of 15, 30, 45, 60, and 100
times. The instrument was placed on a firm pedestal about three feet
high. The feet of this pedestal had short iron pikes, which slipped
into corresponding holes in the floor of the apartment adjacent to a
south window, so that when the direction of the meridian was found, and
the circles properly adjusted, the instrument was in no danger of being
shifted from this position. Though this instrument generally stood
fronting the southern part of the heavens, yet the equatorial part,
along with the telescope, could occasionally be removed to another
position fronting the north and north-west, for observing the stars in
those quarters.

_Manner of observing stars and planets in the day-time by the
equatorial._ Before such observations can be made, the semicircle of
altitude must be placed in the meridian, and the degree and minute
pointed out by the nonius on the horizontal circle, when in this
position, noted down in a book, so that it may be placed again in the
same position, should any derangement afterwards happen. The semicircle
of altitude must be set to the co-latitude of the place; that is, to
what the latitude wants of 90°. Suppose the latitude of the place
of observation be 52° 30´ north, this latitude subtracted from 90°,
leaves 37° 30´ for the co-latitude; and therefore, the semicircle of
altitude--on which the equatorial circle is fixed--must be elevated to
37° 30´, and then the equatorial circle on the instrument coincides
with the equator in the heavens. Lastly, the telescope must be adjusted
on the declination semicircle, so as exactly to correspond with the
declination of the heavenly body to be viewed. If the body is in the
equator, the telescope is set by the index at 0 on the semicircle of
declination, or at the middle point between the two quadrants, and
then when the telescope, along with the semicircle of declination, is
moved from right to left, or the contrary, it describes an arc of the
equator. If the declination of the body be north, the telescope is
elevated to the northern division of the semicircle; if south, to the
southern part of it.

These adjustments being made, take the difference between the Right
Ascension of the sun and the body to be observed; and if the Right
Ascension of the body be greater than that of the sun, subtract the
difference from the time of observation; if not, add to the time of
observation.[39] The remainder in one case, or the sum in the other,
will be the hour and minute to which the nonius on the equatorial
circle is to be set; which being done, the telescope will point to the
star or planet to whose declination the instrument is adjusted. When
the heavenly body is thus found, it may be followed, in its diurnal
course, for hours, or as long as it remains above the horizon. For as
the diurnal motion of a star is parallel to the equator, the motion of
the telescope on the equatorial circle, will always be in the star’s
diurnal arc; and should it have left the field of the telescope for any
considerable time, it may be again recovered, by moving the telescope
onward according to the time which elapsed since it was visible in the
field of view. We may illustrate what has been now stated by an example
or two. Suppose on the 30th April, 1841, at 1 o’clock, P.M. we
wished to see the star _Aldebaran_. The Right Ascension of this star
is 4^h 27^m; and the sun’s Right Ascension for that day at noon, as
found in ‘White’s Ephemeris,’ or the ‘Nautical Almanack,’ is 2^h 30^m.
Subtract this last number from 4^h 27^m, and the remainder 1^h 57^m,
shows that the star comes to the meridian on that day at 57 minutes
past 1 o’clock, P.M. And as the time of observation is 1
P.M., the nonius which moves on the equatorial circle must be
set to 3 minutes past XI, as the star is at that hour 57 minutes from
the meridian. The declination of Aldebaran is 16° 11´ north, to which
point on the semicircle of declination, the telescope must be adjusted,
and then the star will be visible in the field of view. Again, suppose
we wished to observe the planet Venus on the 1st January, 1842, at
12 o’clock noon. The sun’s Right Ascension on that day is 18^h 46^m,
and that of Venus 17^h 41^m, from which the sun’s Right Ascension
being subtracted, the remainder is 22^h 55^m, or 55 minutes past 10,
A.M. Here, as the Right Ascension of Venus is too small to
have the sun’s Right Ascension taken from it, we borrow 24 hours, and
reckon the remainder from XII at noon. As the planet at 12 noon, is 1
hour 5 minutes past the meridian, the nonius on the equatorial circle
must be set to that point, and the telescope adjusted to 23° 6´ of
south declination, which is the declination of Venus for that day, when
this planet will appear in the field of view.


_Observations on the fixed stars and planets, made in the day-time by
the Equatorial._

For the purpose of illustrating the descriptions now given, and for
affording some information respecting celestial day observations,
I shall select a few of the observations above alluded to, which I
formerly published in Nicholson’s Journal, along with a few others
which have been since made. These observations were made with a view to
determine the following particulars:--1. What stars and planets may be
conveniently seen in the day-time, when the sun is above the horizon?
2. What degrees of magnifying power are requisite for distinguishing
them? 3. How near their conjunction with the sun they may be seen?
and 4. Whether the diminution of the aperture of the object-glass of
the telescope, or the increase of magnifying power, conduces most to
render a star or a planet visible in day-light. Having never seen such
observations recorded in books of astronomy or in scientific journals,
I was induced to continue them, almost every clear day for nearly a
year, in order to determine the points now specified. Some of the
results are stated in the following pages.

_Observations on fixed stars of the first magnitude._ April 23, 1813,
at 10^h 15^m, A.M., the sun being 5-1/2 hours above the
horizon. Saw the star _Vega_, or α Lyræ, very distinctly with a power
of 30 times. Having contracted the aperture of the object-glass to
9/10 of an inch, saw it on a darker ground, but not more plainly than
before. Having contracted the aperture still farther, to half an inch,
I perceived the star, but not so distinctly as before. The sky being
very clear, and the star in a quarter of the heavens nearly opposite
to the sun, I diminished the magnifying power to 15, and could still
perceive the star, but indistinctly; it was just perceptible. August
23, at 0^h 12^m, P.M., saw the star _Capella_, or α _Aurigæ_,
with a power of 60, and immediately afterwards with a power of 30;
the aperture undiminished. With this last power it appeared extremely
distinct, but not so brilliant and splendid as with the former power.
Having diminished the aperture to 9/10 of an inch, it appeared on a
darker ground, though in the former case, it was equally perceptible.
A few minutes afterwards, could distinguish it with a power of 15, the
aperture being contracted to half an inch. It appeared very small;
it was with difficulty the eye could fix upon it in the field of the
telescope; but when it was once perceived, its motion across the field
of view could be readily followed. It could not be perceived, when the
diminished aperture was removed. The sun was then shining in meridian
splendour.

August 10th, 9^h 30^m, A.M. Saw the star Sirius with a power
of 60, the aperture contracted to 9/10 inch. Saw it likewise when
the aperture was diminished to half an inch, but not so distinctly
as through the aperture of inch. Having put on a power of 30, could
distinguish it distinctly enough through each of the former apertures,
and likewise when they were removed; but somewhat more distinctly
with the apertures of nine-tenths and half an inch than without them.
At this time the star was 2^h 42^m in time of Right Ascension west
of the sun, having an elevation above the horizon of about 17° 10’;
the sun shining bright, and the sky very much enlightened in that
quarter of the heavens where the star appeared. There was also a
considerable undulation of the air, which is generally the case in
the hot mornings of summer--which renders a star more difficult to
be perceived than in the afternoon, especially when it is viewed at
a low altitude. June 4th, 1^h 30^m, P.M., saw Sirius with a
power of 30 with great distinctness, the aperture not contracted. The
star was then within 1^h 50^m, in time of Right Ascension east from
the sun. August 24th, 9^h 5^m, A.M., saw the star _Procyon_,
or α _Canis-Minoris_ distinctly with a power of 60, the aperture not
contracted. When diminished to 9/10 inch, it appeared rather more
distinct, as the ground on which it was seen was darker. With a power
of 30, and the aperture contracted to 9/10 inch, could perceive it, but
somewhat indistinctly. When the equatorial motion was performed, in
order to keep it in the field of view, it was sometime before the eye
could again fix upon it. When the aperture was diminished to half an
inch, it could not be perceived. Saw it when both the apertures were
removed, but rather more distinctly with the aperture of 9/10 inch. The
difference in the result of this observation, from that of Capella,
above stated, was owing to the star’s proximity to the sun, and the
consequent illumination of the sky in that quarter where it appeared.
Its difference in Right Ascension from that of the sun was then about
2^h 5^m of time, and its difference of declination about 4° 50´.[40]
This star may be considered as one of those which rank between the
first and second magnitudes.

Similar observations to the above were made and frequently repeated
on the stars Rigel, Aldebaran, Betelguese Cor-Leonis and other stars
of the first magnitude, which gave nearly the same results. The stars
Altares and Fomalhaut are not so easily distinguished, on account of
their great southern declination, and consequent low elevation above
the horizon. The following observation on _Arcturus_ may be added.
June 3rd, observed Arcturus very distinctly, a little before 7 in the
evening, the sun being about 1^h 40^m above the horizon, and shining
bright--with a power of 15; the aperture not contracted. It appeared
very small but distinct. This star is easily distinguishable at any
time of the day with a power of 30.

_Observations on stars of the second magnitude._ May 5, 1813, at 6^h,
P.M.; the sun being an hour and three quarters above the
horizon. Saw _Alphard_, or α Hydræ, a star of the second magnitude,
with a power of 60; the aperture diminished to 9/10 inch. A few minutes
afterwards could perceive it, but indistinctly, with a power of 30,
the aperture contracted as above. It could not be seen very distinctly
with this power, till about half an hour before sun-set. It was then
seen rather more distinctly when the aperture was contracted than
without the contraction. May 7th. Saw the star _Deneb_, or β _Leonis_,
distinctly with a power of 60, about an hour and a half before sun-set.
August 20th. Saw Ras Alkague, or α _Ophiuchi_, at 4^h 40^m, _P.M._,
with a power of 100, the sun being nearly 3 hours above the horizon,
and shining bright. Perceived it about an hour afterwards, with a
power of 60--with the aperture contracted to 9/10 inch, and also when
this contraction was removed. The star was seen nearly as distinctly
in the last case as in the first. August 27, 5^h, _P.M._, the same
star appeared quite distinct with a power of 60, the aperture not
contracted. It did not appear more distinct when the aperture was
contracted to 9/10 inch. The sun was then more than 2 hours above the
horizon. August 28th. Saw the star _Pollux_, or β _Gemini_, 2 hours
after sun-rise with a power of 60, aperture undiminished. November
12th, 1_{h} 30´, _P.M._ Saw the star _Altair_, or α _Aquilæ_, with an
8-1/2 inch telescope, 1 inch aperture, carrying a power of 45, the
aperture not contracted. Having contracted the aperture a little, it
appeared somewhat less distinct. This star is reckoned by some to
belong to the class of stars of the first magnitude; but in White’s
‘Ephemeris’ and other Almanacks, it is generally marked as being of the
second magnitude. It forms a kind of medium between stars of the 1st
and of the 2nd magnitude.

Similar observations, giving the same results, were made on the stars
Bellatrix, Orion’s Girdle, α Andromedæ, α Pegasi, Alioth, Benetnasch,
North Crown, or α Coronæ Borealis, and various other stars of the same
magnitude.

From the above and several hundreds of similar observations, _the
following conclusions_ are deduced.

1. That a magnifying power of 30 times is sufficient for distinguishing
a fixed star of the first magnitude, even at noon-day, at any season
of the year; provided it have a moderate degree of elevation above the
horizon, and be not within 30° or 40° of the sun’s body. Also, that, by
a magnifying power of 15, a star of this class may be distinguished,
when the sun is not above an hour and a half above the horizon. But,
in every case, higher powers are to be preferred. Powers of 45 or 60,
particularly the last, were found to answer best in most cases, as with
such powers the eye could fix on the star with ease, as soon as it
entered the field of the telescope.

2. That most of the stars of the 2nd magnitude may be seen with a power
of 60, when the sun is not much more than 2 hours above the horizon;
and, at any time of the day, the brightest stars of this class may be
seen with a power of 100, when the sky is serene, and the star not too
near the quarter in which the sun appears.

3. That, in every instance, an increase of magnifying power has
the principal effect in rendering a star easily perceptible. That
diminution of aperture, in most cases, produces a very slight effect;
in some cases, none at all; and, when the aperture is contracted beyond
a certain limit, it produces a hurtful effect. The cases in which a
moderate contraction is useful, are the two following:--1. When the
star appears in a bright part of the sky, not far from that quarter in
which the sun appears. 2. When an object-glass of a large aperture, and
a small degree of magnifying power, is used. In almost every instance
the contraction of the object-glass of the 8-1/2-inch telescope with
a power of 45, had a hurtful effect. But when the 20-inch telescope
carried a power of only 15, the contraction served to render the object
more perceptible.


_Observations on the Planets made in the day-time._

Some of the planets are not so easily distinguished in the day-time as
the fixed stars of the first magnitude. The one which is most easily
distinguished at all times, is the planet Venus.

1. _Observations on Venus._ My observations on this planet commenced
about the end of August, 1812, about three or four weeks after its
inferior conjunction. About that period, between ten and eleven in the
forenoon, with a power of 45, it appeared as a beautiful crescent,
quite distinct and well-defined, with a lustre similar to that of the
moon about sun-set, but of a whiter colour. The view of its surface and
phase was fully more distinct and satisfactory than what is obtained
in the evening after sun-set; for, being at a high elevation, the
undulation near the horizon did not affect the distinctness of vision.
The planet was then very distinctly seen with a power of 7 times, when
it appeared like a star of the first or second magnitude. I traced the
variation of its phases, almost every clear day, till the month of May,
1813. As at that time, it was not far from its superior conjunction
with the sun, I wished to ascertain how near its conjunction with that
luminary it might be seen; and particularly whether it might not be
possible, in certain cases, to see it at the moment of its conjunction.

The expressions of all astronomical writers previous to this period,
when describing the phases of Venus, either directly assert, or,
at least imply, that it is _impossible_ to see that planet, in any
instance, at the time of its superior conjunction. This is the language
of Dr. Long, Dr. Gregory, Dr. Brewster, Ferguson, Adams, B. Martin, and
most other writers on the science of astronomy. How far such language
is correct will appear from the following observations and remarks.

April 24, 1813, 10^h 50´ A.M. Observed Venus with a power of
30, the aperture not contracted. She was then about 31 minutes, in
time, of right ascension, distant from the sun. Their difference of
declination 3° 59´. She appeared distinct and well-defined. With a
power of 100, could distinguish her gibbous phase. May 1st, 10^h 20^m,
A.M. Viewed this planet with a power of 60; the aperture not
contracted. It appeared distinct. Saw it about the same time with
a power of 15, the aperture being contracted to 9/10 inch. Having
contracted the aperture to 1/2 inch, saw it more distinctly. When the
contracted apertures were removed, the planet could with difficulty be
distinguished, on account of the direct rays of the sun striking on
the inside of the tube of the telescope. The sun was shining bright,
and the planet about 25´ of time in R.A. west of his centre, their
difference of declination being 3° 7´. May 7th, 10^h, A.M.
Saw Venus distinctly with a power of 60, the sun shining bright. It
was then about 19´ in time of R.A. and 4° 27´ in longitude west of the
sun; their difference of declination being 2° 18´. I found a diminution
of aperture particularly useful when viewing the planet at this time,
even when the higher powers were applied. This was the last observation
I had an opportunity of making prior to the conjunction of Venus with
the sun, which happened on May 25th, at 9^h 30^m, A.M. Its
geocentric latitude at that time being about 16´ south, the planet must
have passed almost close by the sun’s southern limb. Cloudy weather for
nearly a month after the last observation, prevented any further views
of the planet, when it was in that part of the heavens which was within
the range of the instrument. The first day that proved favourable after
it had passed the superior conjunction, was June 5th. The following is
the memorandum of the observation then taken.

June 5th, 9^h, A.M. Adjusted the Equatorial Telescope for
viewing the planet Venus, but it could not be perceived, on account
of the direct rays of the sun entering the tube of the telescope.
I contrived an apparatus for screening his rays, but could not get
it conveniently to move along with the telescope; and therefore
determined to wait till past eleven, when the top of the window of the
place of observation would intercept the solar rays. At 11^h 20^m,
A.M., just as the sun had passed the line of sight from the
eye to the top of the window, and his body was eclipsed by it, I was
gratified with a tolerably distinct view of the planet, with a power
of 60. The aperture being contracted to 9/10 inch. The distinctness
increased as the sun retired, till, in two or three minutes, the planet
appeared perfectly well-defined. Saw it immediately afterwards, with
a power of 30, the aperture contracted as before. Saw it also quite
distinctly with a power of 15; but it could not be distinguished with
this power, when the contracted aperture was removed. At this time
Venus was just 3° in longitude, or about 13´ in time of R.A. east of
the sun’s centre, and of course only about 2-3/4 degrees from his
eastern limb; the difference of their declination being 27´, and the
planet’s latitude 11´ north.

Several years afterwards, I obtained views of this planet, when
considerably nearer the sun’s margin than as stated in the above
observation, particularly on the 16th October, 1819, when Venus was
seen when only 6 days and 19 hours past the time of the superior
conjunction. At that time its distance from the sun’s eastern limb
was only 1° 28´ 42´´. A subsequent observation proved that Venus can
be seen when only 1° 27´, from the sun’s margin--which I consider as
approximating to the nearest distance from the sun at which this
planet is distinctly visible.--I shall only state farther the two or
three following observations.

June 7th, 1813, 10^h, A.M. Saw Venus with a power of 60, the
aperture being contracted to 9/10 inch--the direct rays of the sun
_not being intercepted by the top of the window_. The aperture having
being further contracted to 1/2 inch, could perceive her, but not quite
so distinctly. When the contractions were removed, she could scarcely
be seen. She was then 3° 33´ in longitude, and nearly 15 minutes in
time of R.A. distant from the sun’s centre. Some fleeces of clouds
having moved across the field of view, she was seen remarkably distinct
in the interstices--the sun at the same time, being partly obscured
by them.--August 19th, 1^h 10´, P.M. Viewed Venus with a
magnifying power of 100. Could perceive her surface and gibbous phase
almost as distinctly as when the sun is below the horizon. She appeared
bright, steady in her light, and well defined, without that glare and
tremulous appearance she exhibits in the evening when near the horizon.
She was then nearly on the meridian. On the whole, such a view of this
planet is as satisfactory, if not preferable, to those views we obtain
with an ordinary telescope in the evening, when it is visible to the
naked eye.

All the particulars above stated have been confirmed by many subsequent
observations continued throughout a series of years. I shall state only
two recent observations which show that Venus may be seen somewhat
nearer the sun than what is deduced from the preceding observations,
and at the point of its superior conjunction. March 10th, 1842,
observed the planet Venus, then very near the sun, at 19 minutes past
11, A.M. It had passed the point of its superior conjunction
with the sun, on the 5th March, at 1^h 19^m, P.M. The
difference of right ascension between the sun and the planet was then
about 6-1/2 minutes of time, or about 1° 37-1/2´, and it was only about
1° 21´ distant from the sun’s eastern limb. It appeared quite distinct
and well-defined, and might perhaps have been seen on the preceding
day, had the observation been then made.--The following observation
shows that Venus may be seen still nearer the sun than in the preceding
observations, and even _at the moment of its superior_ conjunction. On
the 2nd of October, 1843, this planet passed the point of its superior
conjunction with the sun, at 4^h 15^m, P.M. At two o’clock,
P.M.--only two hours before the conjunction, I perceived the
planet distinctly, and kept it in view for nearly ten minutes, till
some dense clouds intercepted the view. It appeared tolerably distinct
and well-defined, though not brilliant, and with a round full face,
and its apparent path was distinctly traced several times across the
field of view of the telescope. I perceived it afterwards, about half
past four, P.M., only a few minutes after it had passed the
point of conjunction, on which occasion it appeared less distinct than
in the preceding observation, owing to the low altitude of the planet,
being then only a few degrees above the horizon. The observations,
in this instance, were made not with an equatorial instrument, which
I generally use in such observations, but with a good achromatic
telescope 44-1/2 inches focal distance, mounted on a common tripod,
with a terrestrial power of 95 times. A conical tube about ten inches
long was fixed on the object-end of the telescope, at the extremity of
which an aperture, 1-1/2 inch diameter was placed, so as to intercept,
as much as possible, the direct ingress of the solar rays. The top of
the upper sash of the window of the place of observation was likewise
so adjusted as to intercept the greater part of the sun’s rays from
entering the tube of the telescope. The sun’s declination at that time
was 3° 26´ south, and that of Venus 2° 12´ south; consequently, the
difference of declination was 1° 14´ = the distance of Venus from the
sun’s centre; and as the sun’s diameter was about 16´, Venus was then
only 58´ from the sun’s northern limb, or 6´ less than two diameters of
the sun.

This is the nearest approximation to the sun at which I have ever
beheld this planet, and it demonstrates that Venus may be seen even
when within a degree of the sun’s margin; and it is perhaps the nearest
position to that luminary in which this planet can be distinctly
perceived. It shows that the light reflected from the surface of Venus
is far more brilliant than that reflected from the surface of our moon;
for no trace of this nocturnal luminary can be perceived, even when at
a much greater distance from the sun, nor is there any other celestial
body that can be seen within the limit now stated. This is the first
observation, so far as my information extends, of Venus having been
seen at the time of her superior conjunction.[41]

The practical conclusion from this observation is, that, at the
superior conjunction of this planet, when its distance from the sun’s
margin is not less than 58´, _its polar and equatorial diameter may be
measured_ by a micrometer, when it will be determined whether or not
Venus be of a _spheroidal_ figure. The Earth, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn
are found to be not spheres but _spheroids_, having their polar shorter
than their equatorial diameters. But the true figure of Venus has never
yet been ascertained, because it is only at the superior conjunction
that she presents a full enlightened hemisphere, and when both
diameters can be measured, except at the time when she transits the
sun’s disk, which happens only twice in the course of 120 years.[42]

The following conclusions are deduced from the observations made on
Venus.

1. That this planet may be seen distinctly, with a moderate degree of
magnifying power, _at the moment of its superior conjunction with the
sun_, when its geocentric latitude, either north or south, at the
time of conjunction, is not less than 1° 14´, or, when the planet is
about 58´ from the sun’s limb. This conclusion is deduced from the
observation of Oct. 2, 1843,[45] stated above.

2. Another conclusion is--that during the space of 583 days, or about
19 months--the time this planet takes in moving from one conjunction
with the sun to a like conjunction again--when its latitude at the
time of its superior conjunction exceeds 1° 14´, it may be seen
with an equatorial telescope every clear day without interruption,
except about the period of its _inferior_ conjunction, when its dark
hemisphere is turned towards the earth, and a short time before and
after it. When its geocentric latitude is less than 1° 14´, it will be
hid only about four days before, and the same time after its superior
conjunction. During the same period it will be invisible to the naked
eye, and consequently no observations can be made upon it with a common
telescope, for nearly six months, and sometimes more, according as its
declination is north or south, namely about two or three months before,
and the same time after its superior conjunction, except where there
is a very free and unconfined horizon. In regard to the time in which
this planet can be hid about the period of its _inferior_ conjunction,
I have ascertained from observation, that it can never be hid longer
than during a space of 2 days 22 hours; having seen Venus, about noon,
like a fine slender crescent, only 35 hours after she had passed the
point of her inferior conjunction; and in a late instance she was seen
when little more than a day from the period of conjunction. The longest
time, therefore, that this planet can be hid from view during a period
of 583 days, is only about 10 days; and when its latitude at the time
of the superior conjunction, equals or exceeds 1° 14´, it can be hid
little more than two days. This is a circumstance which cannot be
affirmed of any other celestial body, the sun only excepted.

3. That every variation of the phases of this planet--from a slender
crescent to a full enlightened hemisphere--may, on every clear day,
be conveniently exhibited by means of the equatorial telescope.
This circumstance renders this instrument peculiarly useful in the
instruction of the young in the principles of astronomy. For, if the
phase which Venus should exhibit at any particular time be known, the
equatorial telescope may be directed to the planet, and its actual
phase in the heavens be immediately exhibited to the astronomical pupil.

4. Since it is only at the period of the superior conjunction that
this planet presents a full enlightened hemisphere, and since it is
only when this phase is presented that both its diameters can be
measured--it is of some importance that observations be made on it at
the moment of conjunction, by means of powerful telescopes furnished
with micrometers, so as to determine the difference (if any) between
its polar and equatorial diameters.

5. Another conclusion from the observations on Venus, is, that a
moderate diminution of the aperture of the object-glass of the
telescope is useful, and even necessary in viewing this planet when
near the sun. Its effect is owing in part to the direct solar rays
being thereby more effectually excluded; for when these rays enter
directly into the tube of the telescope, it is very difficult, and
almost impossible to perceive this planet, or any other celestial body
when in the vicinity of the sun.


_Observations on Jupiter and other planets._

This planet is very easily distinguished in the day-time with a very
moderate magnifying power, when it is not within 30° or 35° of the sun.
The following extract from my memorandums may serve as a specimen. May
12, 1813, 1^h 40^m, P.M. Saw Jupiter with a power of 15 times,
the aperture not contracted. The planet appeared so distinct with this
power, that I have reason to believe, it would have been perceived with
a power of 6 or 7 times. When the aperture was contracted 9/10 inch,
and afterwards to half an inch, there was little perceptible difference
in its appearance. It was then about 58° in longitude, east of the sun.

Though Jupiter when at a considerable distance from the sun, and near
his opposition, appears to the naked eye with a brilliancy nearly equal
to that of Venus, yet there is a very striking difference between them,
in respect of lustre, when viewed in day-light. Jupiter, when viewed
with a high magnifying power, in the day-time, always exhibits a very
dull cloudy appearance; whereas Venus appears with a moderate degree of
splendour. About the end of June 1813, between 5 and 6 in the evening,
having viewed the planet Venus, then within 20° of the sun, and which
appeared with a moderate degree of lustre, I directed the telescope to
Jupiter, at that time more than 32° from the sun, when the contrast
between the two planets was very striking, Jupiter appearing so faint
as to be just discernible, though his apparent magnitude was nearly
double that of Venus. In this observation a power of 65 was used.
In his approach towards the sun, about the end of July, I could not
perceive him when he was within 16° or 17° of his conjunction with that
luminary.--_These circumstances furnish a sensible and popular proof_,
independently of astronomical calculations, _that the planet Jupiter
is placed at a much greater distance from the sun than Venus_; since
its light is so faint as to be scarcely perceptible when more than 20
degrees from the sun, while that of Venus is distinctly seen amidst
the full splendour of the solar rays, when only about a degree from
the margin of that luminary. With a power of 65 I have been enabled
to distinguish the _belts_ of Jupiter before sun-set, but could never
perceive any of his satellites till the sun was below the horizon.
There are no observations which so sensibly and strikingly indicate
the different degrees of light emitted by the different planets as
those which are made in the day-time. To a common observer, during
night, Jupiter and Venus appear, in a clear sky, nearly with equal
brilliancy, and even Mars, when about the point of his _opposition_ to
the sun, appears with a lustre somewhat similar, though tinged with a
ruddy hue; but when seen in day-light their aspect is very dissimilar.
This circumstance evidently indicates, 1. that these planets are
placed at different distances from the sun, and consequently are
furnished with different degrees of light proportional to the square
of their distances from that luminary;--and 2. that there are certain
circumstances connected with the surfaces and atmospheres of the
planetary bodies, which render the light they emit more or less
intense, independently of their different distances from the central
luminary. For Mars, though much nearer to the sun than Jupiter, is not
so easily distinguished in the day-time, and, even in the night-time,
appears with a less degree of lustre.

My observations on _Saturn_ in day-light, have not been so frequent as
those on Jupiter. I have been enabled to distinguish his ring several
times before sun-set, with a power of 65; but his great southern
declination, and consequent low altitude, at the periods when these
observations were made, were unfavourable for determining the degree
of his visibility in day-light; for a planet or a star is always more
distinctly perceptible in a _high_ than in a low altitude, on account
of the superior purity of the atmosphere through which a celestial
object is seen when at a high elevation above the horizon. This planet,
however, is not nearly so distinctly visible in day-light as Jupiter,
and I have chiefly seen it, when the sun was not more than an hour or
two above the horizon, but never at noon-day; although it is probable
that with powerful instruments it may be seen even at that period
of the day. The planet _Mars_ is seldom distinctly visible in the
day-time, except when at no great distance from its opposition to the
sun. The following is a memorandum of an observation on Mars, when in a
favourable position. October 24, 1836. Saw the planet Mars distinctly
with a power of about 60, at 40 minutes past 9 A.M., the
sun having been above the horizon nearly three hours. It appeared
tolerably distinct, but scarcely so brilliant as a fixed star of the
first magnitude, but with apparently as much light as Jupiter generally
exhibits when viewed in day-light. It could not be traced longer at the
time, so as to ascertain if it could be seen at mid-day; on account
of the interposition of the western side of the window of the place
of observation. The ruddy aspect of this planet--doubtless caused by
a dense atmosphere with which it is environed--is one of the causes
which prevents its appearing with brilliancy in the day-time. With
respect to the planet _Mercury_, I have had opportunities of observing
it several times after sun-rise, and before sun-set, about 10 or 12
days before and after its greatest elongation from the sun, with a
power of 45. I have several times searched for this planet about noon,
but could not perceive it. The air, however, at the times alluded to,
was not very clear, and I was not certain that it was within the field
of the telescope; and therefore, I am not convinced but that, with a
moderately high power, it may be seen even at noon-day.

Such are some specimens of the observations I have made on the heavenly
bodies in the day-time, and the conclusions which may be deduced from
them. I have been induced to communicate them, from the consideration,
that the most minute facts, in relation to any science, are worthy of
being known, and may possibly be useful. They may at least gratify the
astronomical tyro with some information which he will not find in the
common treatises on astronomy, and may perhaps excite him to prosecute
a train of similar observations for confirming or correcting those
which have been noted above.

Besides the deductions already stated, the following general
conclusions may be noted.--1. That a celestial body may be as easily
distinguished at noon-day, as at any time between the hours of nine in
the morning and three in the afternoon, except during the short days
in winter. 2. They are more easily distinguished at a high than at
a low altitude--in the afternoon than in the morning, especially if
their altitudes be low--and in the northern region of the heavens than
in the southern. The difficulty of perceiving them at a low altitude
is obviously owing to the thick vapours near the horizon. Their being
less easily distinguished in the morning than in the afternoon is owing
to the undulations of the atmosphere, which are generally greater in
the morning than in the afternoon. This may be evidently perceived
by looking at distant land-objects at those times, in a hot day,
through a telescope which magnifies about 40 or 50 times, when they
will be found to appear tremulous and distorted in consequence of these
undulations, especially if the sun be shining bright. In consequence
of this circumstance, we can seldom use a high terrestrial power with
effect on land objects, except early in the morning, and a short
time before sun-set. Their being more easily distinguished in the
northern region of the heavens is owing to that part of the sky being
of a deeper azure, on account of its being less enlightened than the
southern with the splendour of the solar rays.


_Utility of Celestial Day Observations._

The observations on the heavenly bodies in the day-time, to which I
have now directed the attention of the reader, are not to be considered
as merely gratifications of a rational curiosity, but may be rendered
subservient to the promotion of astronomical science. As to the planet
Venus--when I consider the degree of brilliancy it exhibits, even in
day-light, I am convinced that useful observations might frequently
be made on its surface in the day-time, to determine some of its
physical peculiarities and phenomena. Such observations might set
at rest any disputes which may still exist respecting the period of
rotation of this planet. Cassini, from observations on a bright spot,
which advanced 20° in 24^h 34^m determined the time of its rotation to
be 23 hours, 20 minutes. On the other hand, Bianchini, from similar
observations, concluded that its diurnal period was 24 days and 8
hours. The difficulty of deciding between these two opinions, arises
from the short time in which observations can be made on this planet,
either before sun-rise, or after sun-set, which prevents us from
tracing, with accuracy, the progressive motion of its spots for a
sufficient length of time. And, although an observer should mark the
motion of the spots at the same hour, on two succeeding evenings, and
find they had moved forward about 15° in 24 hours, he would still be
at a loss to determine, whether they had moved only 15°, in all, since
the preceding observation, or had finished a revolution and 15° more.
If, therefore, any spots could be perceived on the surface of Venus
in the day-time, their motion might be traced, when she is in north
declination, for 12 hours or more, which would completely settle the
period of rotation. That it is not improbable that spots, fitted for
this purpose, may be discovered on her disk in the day-time, appears
from some of the observations of Cassini, who saw one of her spots when
the sun was more than eight degrees above the horizon.[46] The most
distinct and satisfactory views I have ever had of this planet were
those which I obtained in the day-time, in summer, when it was viewed
at a high altitude, with a 44-1/2 inch achromatic telescope, carrying a
power of 150. I have at such times distinctly perceived the distinction
between the shade and colour of its margin, and the superior lustre of
its central parts, and some spots have occasionally been seen, though
not so distinctly marked as to determine its rotation. Such distinct
views are seldom to be obtained in the evening after sun-set, on
account of the undulations of the atmosphere, and the dense mass of
vapours through which the celestial bodies are viewed when near the
horizon.

Nor do I consider it altogether improbable that its _satellite_ (if
it have one, as some have supposed) may be detected in the day time,
when this planet is in a favourable position for such an observation;
particularly when a pretty large portion of its enlightened surface
is turned towards the earth, and when its satellite, of course, must
present a similar phase. About the period of its greatest elongation
from the sun, and soon after it assumes a crescent phase, in its
approach to the inferior conjunction, may be considered as the most
eligible times for prosecuting such observations. If this supposed
satellite be about one third or one fourth of the diameter of its
Primary, as Cassini, Short, Baudouin, Montbarron, Montaigne, and other
astronomers supposed, it must be nearly as large as Mercury, which has
been frequently seen in day-light. If such a satellite have a real
existence, and yet undistinguishable in day-light, its surface must be
of a very different quality for reflecting the rays of light from that
of its primary; for it is obvious to every one who has seen Venus with
a high power, in the day-time, that a body of equal brilliancy--though
four times less in diameter--would be quite perceptible, and exhibit a
visible disk. Such observations, however, would be made, with a much
greater effect in Italy and other Southern countries, and particularly
in Tropical climates, such as the southern parts of Asia and America,
and in the West India Islands, where the sky is more clear and serene,
and where the planet may be viewed at higher altitudes, and for a
greater length of time, without the interruption of clouds, than in our
island.

Again, the apparent magnitudes of the fixed stars--the quantity of
light they respectively emit--and the precise class of magnitude which
should be assigned to them--might be more accurately determined by
day observations, than by their appearance in the nocturnal sky. All
the stars which are reckoned to belong to the _first magnitude_ are
not equally distinguishable in day-light. For example, the stars
_Aldebaran_ and _Procyon_ are not so easily distinguished, nor do they
appear with the same degree of lustre by day, as the stars α _Lyræ_
and _Capella_. In like manner the stars _Altair_, _Alphard_, _Deneb
Ras Alkague_, considered as belonging to the _second_ magnitude,
are not equally distinguishable by the same aperture and magnifying
power--which seems to indicate, that a different quantity of light
is emitted by these stars, arising from a difference either in their
magnitude, their distance, or the quality of the light with which they
are irradiated.

The following are likewise practical purposes to which celestial day
observations may be applied. In accurately adjusting Circular and
Transit instruments, it is useful, and even necessary, for determining
the exact position of the meridian, to take observations of certain
stars, which differ greatly in zenith distance, and which transit the
meridian nearly at the same time. But as the stars best situated for
this purpose, cannot, at every season, be seen in the evenings, we
must, in certain cases, wait for several months till such observations
can be made, unless we make them in the day-time, which can very easily
be done, if the instrument have a telescope adapted to it, furnished
with such powers as those above stated, or higher powers if required. I
have likewise made use of observations on the stars in the day time for
adjusting a clock or watch to meantime, when the sun was in a situation
beyond the range of the instrument, or obscured by clouds, and when
I did not choose to wait till the evening. This may, at first view,
appear to some as paradoxical; since the finding of a star in day-light
depends on our knowing its right Ascension from the sun, and this last
circumstance depends, in some measure, on our knowing the true time.
But if a watch or clock is known not to have varied above seven or
eight minutes from the time, a star of the first magnitude may easily
be found, by moving the telescope a little backwards or forwards, till
the star appear; and when it is once found, the exact variation of the
movement is then ascertained, by comparing the calculations which were
previously necessary, with the time pointed out by the nonius on the
Equatorial circle--or, in other words, by ascertaining the difference
between the time assumed, and the time indicated by the instrument,
when the star appears in the centre of the field of view. All this may
be accomplished in five or six minutes.

Besides the practical purposes now stated, the Equatorial telescope is
perhaps the best instrument for instructing a learner in the various
operations of practical astronomy, and particularly for enabling him
to distinguish the names and positions of the principal stars. For,
when the right Ascension and Declination of any star is known, from
astronomical tables, the telescope may be immediately adjusted to
point to it, which will infallibly prevent his mistaking one star for
another. In this way, likewise, the precise position of the planet
_Mercury_, _Uranus_, _Vesta_, _Juno_, _Ceres_, _Pallas_--a small
comet, a nebula, a double star, or any other celestial body not easily
distinguishable by the naked eye, may be readily pointed out, when its
right Ascension and Declination are known to a near approximation.

In conclusion, I cannot but express my surprise, that the Equatorial
telescope is so little known, even by many of the lovers of
astronomical science. In several respectable academies in this part of
Britain, and, if I am not misinformed, in most of our universities,
this instrument is entirely unknown. This is the more unaccountable,
as a small equatorial may be purchased for a moderate sum; and as
there is no single instrument so well adapted for illustrating all the
operations of Practical Astronomy. Where very great accuracy is not
required, it may occasionally be made to serve the general purposes
of a _transit instrument_ for observing the passages of the sun and
stars across the meridian. It may likewise be made to serve as a
_theodolite_ for surveying land and taking horizontal angles--as a
_Quadrant_ for taking angles of altitude--as a _level_--as an _equal
altitude instrument_--an _azimuth instrument_ for ascertaining the
sun’s distance from the north or south points of the horizon--and
as an accurate Universal Sun Dial, for finding the exact _mean_ or
_true_ time, on any occasion when the sun is visible. The manner of
applying it to these different purposes will be obvious to every one
who is in the least acquainted with the nature and construction of this
instrument.

The price of a small Equatorial instrument, such as that described
p. 454, is about 16 guineas, exclusive of some of the eye-pieces,
which were afterwards added for the purpose of making particular
observations. Instruments of a larger size, and with more complicated
machinery, sell from 50 to 100 guineas and upwards. Messrs. W. and S.
Jones, Holborn, London, construct such instruments.


ON THE QUADRANT.

[Illustration: _figure 87._]

Every circle being supposed to be divided into 360 equal parts, or
degrees,--it is evident, that 90 degrees, or the fourth part of a
circle, will be sufficient to measure all angles, between the horizon
of any place and the line perpendicular to it which goes up to the
zenith. Thus, in fig. 87, the line CB represents the plane of the
horizon. ACBH, the quadrant, AC the perpendicular to the horizon,
and A the zenith point. If the lines BC and CA represent a pair of
compasses with the legs standing perpendicular to each other, and
the curved lines AB, DE and FG, the quarter of as many circles of
different sizes--it is evident that although each of these differs
from the others in size, yet that each contains the same portion of a
circle, namely a quadrant or fourth part; and thus it would be from the
smallest to the largest quadrant that could be formed,--they would all
contain exactly 90 degrees each. By the application of this principle
the comparative measure of angles may be extended to an indefinite
distance. By means of an instrument constructed in the form of a
quadrant of a circle, with its curved edge divided into 90 equal parts,
the altitude of any object in the heavens can at any time be determined.

There are various constructions of this instrument, some of them
extremely simple, and others considerably complex and expensive,
according to the degree of accuracy which the observations require. The
following is a description of the _Pillar Quadrant_, as it was made by
Mr. Bird, for the observatory of Greenwich, and several continental
observatories.

This instrument consists of a quadrant E E H G L (fig. 88.) mounted on
a pillar B, which is supported by a tripod AA, resting on three foot
screws. The quadrant, the pillar, and the horizontal circle all revolve
round a vertical axis. A telescope H is placed on the horizontal
radius, and is directed to a meridian mark previously made on some
distant object for placing the plane of the instrument in the meridian,
and also for setting the zero, or beginning of the scale truly
horizontal. This is sometimes done by a level instead of a telescope,
and sometimes by a plumb-line G, suspended from near the centre, and
brought to bisect a fine dot made on the limb, where a microscope is
placed to examine the bisection. The weight or plummet at the end of
the plumb-line is suspended in the cistern of water _b_, which keeps it
from being agitated by the air. A similar dot is made for the upper end
of the plumb-line upon a piece of brass, adjustable by a screw _d_, in
order that the line may be exactly at right angles to the telescope,
when it is placed at O. The quadrant is screwed by the centre
of its frame, against a piece of brass _e_ with three screws, and this
piece is screwed to the top of the pillar B with other three screws.
By means of the first three screws, the plane of the quadrant can be
placed exactly parallel to the vertical axis, and by the other screws
the telescope H can be placed exactly perpendicular to it. The nut of
the delicate screw L is attached to the end of the telescope F, by a
universal joint. The collar for the other end is jointed in the same
manner to a clamp which can be fastened to any part of the limb.
A similar clamp-screw and slow motion is seen at _n_ for the lower
circle, which is intended to hold the circle fast, and adjust its
motion. The divisions of the lower, or horizontal circle, are read by
verniers, or noniuses, fixed to the arms of the tripod at _l_ and _m_,
and, in some cases three are used to obtain greater accuracy.

[Illustration: _figure 88._]

In using this quadrant, the axis of the telescope H is adjusted to a
horizontal line, and the plane of the quadrant to a vertical line, by
the means already stated. The screw of the champ L is then loosened,
and the telescope directed to the star, or other object, whose altitude
is required. The clamp screw being fixed, the observer looks through
the telescope, and with the nut of the screw L he brings the telescope
into a position where the star is bisected by the intersection of the
wires in the field of the telescope. The divisions are then to be read
off upon the vernier, and the altitude of the star will be obtained.
By means of the horizontal circle D, all angles in the plane of the
horizon may be accurately measured--such as the amplitudes and azimuths
of the celestial bodies.

Quadrants of a more simple construction than the above, may be
occasionally used, such as Gunter’s, Cole’s, Sutton’s and others; but
none of these are furnished with telescopes, or telescopic sights, and
therefore an altitude cannot be obtained by them with the same degree
of accuracy as with that which has been now described.

By means of the Quadrant, not only the altitudes of the heavenly bodies
may be determined, but also the distances of objects on the earth by
observations made at two stations--the altitude of fireballs and other
meteors in the atmosphere--the height of a cloud, by observation on
its altitude and velocity--and numerous other problems, the solution of
which depends upon angular measurements. A _Mural Quadrant_ is the name
given to this instrument when it is fixed upon a wall of stone, and in
the plane of the meridian, such as the quadrant which was erected by
Flamstead in the Observatory at Greenwich. Although the quadrant was
formerly much used in astronomical observations, yet it may be proper
to state, that its use has now been almost completely superseded by
the recent introduction of _Astronomical Circles_, of which we shall
now give the reader a very short description, chiefly taken from
Troughton’s account of the instrument he constructed, as found in Sir
D. Brewster’s Supplement to Ferguson’s Astronomy.


THE ASTRONOMICAL CIRCLE.

[Illustration: _figure 89._]

An astronomical circle is a _complete circle_ substituted in place
of the quadrant, and differs from it only in the superior accuracy
with which it enables the astronomer to make his observations. The
large vertical or declination circle CC (fig. 89.) is composed of two
complete circles strengthened by an edge bar on their inside, and
firmly united at their extreme borders by a number of short braces or
bars which stand perpendicular between them, and which keep them at
such a distance as to admit the achromatic telescope TT. This double
circle is supported by 16 conical bars, firmly united along with the
telescope, to a horizontal axis. The exterior limb of each circle is
divided into degrees and parts of a degree, and these divisions are
divided into seconds by means of the micrometer microscopes _mm_,
which read off the angle on opposite sides of each circle. The cross
wires in each microscope may be moved over the limb till they coincide
with the nearest division of the limb, by means of the micrometer
screws _cc_, and the space moved through is ascertained by the
divisions on the graduated head above _c_, assisted by a scale within
the microscope. The microscopes are supported by two arms proceeding
from a small circle concentric with the horizontal axis, and fixed
to the vertical columns. This circle is the centre upon which they
can turn round nearly a quadrant for the purpose of employing a new
portion of the divisions of the circle, when it is reckoned prudent to
repeat any delicate observations upon any part of the limb. At _h_ is
represented a level for placing the axis in a true horizontal line, and
at _k_ is fixed another level parallel to the telescope, for bringing
the zero of the divisions to a horizontal position. The horizontal axis
to which the vertical circle and the telescope are fixed, is equal in
length to the distance between the vertical pillars, and its pivots are
supported by semicircular bearings, placed at the top of each pillar.
These two vertical pillars are firmly united at their bases to a cross
bar _f_. To this cross bar is also fixed a vertical axis about three
feet long, the lower end of which terminating in an obtuse point, rests
in a brass conical socket firmly fastened at the bottom of the hollow
in the stone pedestal D, which receives the vertical axis. This socket
supports the whole weight of the moveable part of the instrument. The
upper part of the vertical axis is supported by two pieces of brass,
one of which is seen at _e_, screwed to the ring _i_, and containing
a right angle, or Y. At each side of the ring, opposite to the points
of contact, is placed a tube containing a heliacal spring, which, by
a constant pressure on the axis, keeps it against its bearings, and
permits it to turn, in these four points of contact, with an easy and
steady motion. The two bearings are fixed upon two rings capable of
a lateral adjustment; the lower one by the screw _d_ to incline the
axis to the east or west, while the screw _b_ gives the upper one _i_
a motion in the plane of the meridian. By this means the axis may be
adjusted to a perpendicular position as exactly as by the usual method
of the tripod with feet screws. These rings are attached to the centre
piece _s_, which is firmly connected with the upper surface of the
stone by six conical Tubes A, A, A, &c., and brass standards at every
angle of the pedestal. Below this frame lies the azimuth circle EE
consisting of a circular limb, strengthened by ten hollow cones firmly
united with the vertical axis, and consequently turning freely along
with it. The azimuth circle EE is divided and read off in the same
manner as the vertical circle. The arms of the microscopes BB project
from the ring _i_, and the microscopes themselves are adjustable by
screws, to bring them to zero and to the diameter of the circle. A
little above the ring _i_ is fixed an arm L which embraces and holds
fast the vertical axis with the aid of a champ screw. The arm L is
connected at the extremity with one of the arms A, by means of the
screw _a_, so that by turning this screw, a slow motion is communicated
to the vertical axis and the azimuth circle.

In order to place the instrument in a true vertical position, a
plumb-line, made of fine silver wire, is suspended from a small hook
at the top of the vertical tube _n_, connected by braces with one of
the large pillars. The plumb-line passes through an angle in which it
rests, and by means of a screw may be brought into the axis of the
tube. The plummet at the lower end of the line is immersed in a cistern
of water _t_, in order to check its oscillations, and is supported on
a shelf proceeding from one of the pillars. At the lower end of the
tube _n_ are fixed two microscopes _o_ and _p_, at right angles to
one another, and opposite to each is placed a small tube containing a
lucid point. The plumb-line is then brought into such a position by
the screws _d_, _b_, and by altering the suspension of the plumb-line
itself, that the image of the luminous point, like the disk of a
planet, is formed on the plumb-line, and accurately bisected by it. The
vertical axis is then turned round, and the plumb-line examined in some
other position. If it still bisects the luminous point, the instrument
is truly vertical; but if it does not, one half of the deviation must
be corrected by the screws _d_ _b_, and the other half by altering the
suspension of the line till the bisection of the circular image is
perfect in every position of the instrument.

It is not many years since Circular Repeating instruments came into
general use. The principle on which the construction of a repeating
circle is founded appears to have been first suggested by Professor
Mayer of Gottingen, in 1758; but the first person who applied this
principle to measure round the limb of a divided instrument, was Borda,
who about the year 1789, caused a repeating circle to be constructed
that would measure with equal facility horizontal and vertical angles.
Afterwards, Mr. Troughton greatly improved the construction of Borda’s
instrument by the introduction of several contrivances which ensure,
at the same time, its superior accuracy and convenience in use; and
his instruments have been introduced into numerous observatories.
Circular instruments, on a large scale, have been placed in the Royal
Observatory of Greenwich, and in most of the principal observatories
on the continent of Europe. Although it is agreed on all hands that
greater accuracy may be obtained by a repeating circle, than by any
other having the same radius, yet there are some objections to its use
which do not apply to the altitude and azimuth circle. The following
are the principal objections, as stated in Vol. I., of the ‘Memoirs of
the Astronomical Society of London.’ 1. The origin of the repeating
circle is due to _bad dividing_, which ought not to be tolerated in any
instrument in the present state of the art. 2. There are three sources
of fixed error which cannot be exterminated, as they depend more on the
materials than on the workmanship; first, the zero of the level changes
with variations of temperature; secondly, the resistance of the centre
work to the action of the tangent screws; and thirdly, the imperfection
of the screws in producing motion, and in securing permanent positions.
3. The instrument is applied with most advantage to slowly moving or
circumpolar stars; but in low altitudes these stars are seen near the
horizon, where refraction interferes. 4. Much time and labour are
expended, first in making the observations, and again in reducing them.
5. When any one step in a series of observations is bad, the whole time
and labour are absolutely lost. 6. When the instrument has a telescope
of small power, the observations are charged with errors of vision,
which the repeating circle will not cure. 7. This instrument cannot be
used as a transit instrument, nor for finding the exact meridian of a
place.

A great variety of directions is necessary in order to enable the
student of practical astronomy thoroughly to understand and to apply
this instrument to practice, which the limited nature of the present
work prevents us from detailing.--As this instrument consists of a
variety of complicated pieces of machinery, it is necessarily somewhat
expensive. A six inch brass astronomical circle for altitudes, zenith
or polar distances, azimuths, with achromatic telescope, &c., is marked
in Messrs. W. and S. Jones’ catalogue of astronomical instruments, at
£27 6s. A circle 12 inches diameter, from £36 15s. to £68 5s. An 18
inch ditto, of the best construction, £105. The larger astronomical
circles for public observatories, from 100 to a 1000 guineas and
upwards, according to their size, and the peculiarity of their
construction.


THE TRANSIT INSTRUMENT.

A Transit instrument is intended for observing celestial objects as
they pass across the meridian. It consists of a telescope fixed at
right angles to a horizontal axis--which axis must be so supported that
what is called _the line of collimation_, or the line of sight of the
telescope, may move in the plane of the meridian. This instrument was
first invented by Romer in the year 1689, but has since received great
improvements by Troughton, Jones and other modern artists. Transit
instruments may be divided into two classes, _Portable_, and _Fixed_.
The portable instrument, when placed truly in the meridian, and well
adjusted, may be advantageously used as a stationary instrument in an
observatory, if its dimensions be such as to admit of a telescope of
3-1/2 feet focal length; but when the main tube is only from 20 to
30 inches long, with a proportional aperture, it is more suited for
a travelling instrument to give the exact time; and, when carried on
board a ship in a voyage of discovery, may be taken on shore at any
convenient place, for determining the solar time of that place, and for
correcting the daily rate of the Chronometer giving the time at the
first meridian, so that the longitude of the place of observation may
be obtained from the difference of the observed and indicated times,
after the proper corrections have been made.

[Illustration: _figure 90._]

The following is a brief description of one of Mr. Troughton’s Portable
Transit Instruments. In fig. 90. PP is an achromatic telescope firmly
fixed, by the middle to a double conical and horizontal axis HH, the
pivots of which rest on angular bearings called Ys, at the top of
the standards B, B, rendered steady by oblique braces DD, fastened
to the central part of the circle, AA. In large fixed instruments,
the pivots and angular bearings are supported on two massive stone
pillars, sunk several feet into the ground, and are sometimes supported
by mason-work, to secure perfect stability. The axis HH has two
adjustments, one for making it exactly level, and the other for placing
the telescope in the meridian. A graduated circle L is fixed to the
extremity of the pivot which extends beyond one of the Ys, and the two
radii that carry the verniers _aa_, are fitted to the extremities of
the pivot in such a way as to turn round independent of the axis. The
double verniers have a small level attached to them, and a third arm
_b_, which is connected with the standard B by means of a screw _s_.
If the verniers are placed by means of the level, in a true horizontal
position, when the axis of the telescope is horizontal, and the arm _b_
screwed by the screw _s_ to the standard B, the verniers will always
read off the inclination of the telescope, and will enable the observer
to point it to any star, by means of its meridian altitude. The whole
instrument rests on three foot screws entered into the circle AA. In
the field of view of the telescope, there are several parallel vertical
wires, crossed at right angles with a horizontal one, and the telescope
is sometimes furnished with a diagonal eye-piece, for observing stars
near the zenith. A level likewise generally accompanies the instrument,
in order to place it horizontal, by being applied to the pivots of the
axis.

In order to fix the transit instrument exactly in the meridian, a good
clock regulated to sidereal time is necessary. This regulation may be
effected by taking equal altitudes of the sun or a star before and
after they pass the meridian, which may be done by small quadrants,
or by a good sextant. The axis H of the instrument is then to be
placed horizontal by a spirit level, which accompanies the transit,
and the greatest care must be taken that the axis of vision describes
in the heavens a great circle of the sphere. To ascertain whether the
telescope be in the plane of the meridian, observe by the clock when
a circumpolar star seen through the telescope transits both above and
below the pole; and if the times of describing the eastern and western
parts of its circuit be equal, the telescope is then in the plane of
the meridian; otherwise, certain adjustments must be made. When the
telescope is at length perfectly adjusted, a land-mark must be fixed
upon, at a considerable distance--the greater the better. This mark
must be in the horizontal direction of the intersection of the cross
wires, and in a place where it can be illuminated, if possible, in the
night time, by a lantern hanging near it; which mark being on a fixed
object, will serve at all times afterwards for examining the position
of the telescope.

Various observations and adjustments are requisite in order to fixing a
transit instrument exactly in the plane of the meridian. There is the
adjustment of the _level_--the horizontal adjustment of the axis of
the telescope--the placing of the parallel lines in the focus of the
eye-glass, so as to be truly vertical, and to determine the equatorial
value of their intervals--the collimation in _azimuth_, so that a
line passing from the middle vertical line to the optical centre of
the object-glass, is at right angles with the axis of the telescope’s
motion--the collimation in _altitude_, so that the horizontal line
should cross the parallel vertical lines, not only at right angles, but
also in the optical centre of the field of view--with various other
particulars; but of which our limited space will not permit us to enter
into details. Those who wish to enter into all the minute details in
reference to the construction and practical application of this and the
other instruments above described, as well as all the other instruments
used by the Practical Astronomer, will find ample satisfaction in
perusing the Rev. Dr. Pearson’s Introduction to Practical Astronomy,
4to., Vol. II.

A portable Transit instrument, with a cast-iron stand, the axis 12
inches in length, and the achromatic telescope about 20 inches, packed
in a case, sells at about 16 guineas: with a brass-framed stand and
other additions, at about 20 guineas. Transit instruments of larger
dimensions are higher in proportion to their size, &c.




CHAPTER III.


ON OBSERVATORIES.

In order to make observations, with convenience and effect, on the
heavenly bodies, it is expedient that an _observatory_, or place for
making the requisite observations, be erected in a proper situation.
The following are some of the leading features of a spot adapted for
making celestial observations: 1. It should command an extensive
visible horizon all around, particularly towards the south and the
north. 2. It should be a little elevated above surrounding objects.
3. It should be, if possible, at a considerable distance from
manufactories, and other objects which emit much smoke or vapour,
and even from chimney-tops where no sensible smoke is emitted, as
the heated air from the top of funnels causes undulations in the
atmosphere. 4. It should be at a distance from swampy ground or valleys
that are liable to be covered with fogs and exhalations. 5. It should
not, if possible, be too near public roads, particularly if paved with
stones, and frequented by heavy carriages, as in such situations,
undulations and tremulous motions may be produced, injurious to the
making of accurate observations with graduated instruments. 6. It is
expedient that the astronomical observer should have access to some
distant field within a mile of the observatory, on which a meridian
mark may be fixed, after his graduated instruments are properly
adjusted. The distance at which a meridian mark should be erected will
depend in part on the focal length of the telescope generally used
for making observations on the Right Ascensions and declinations of
the stars. It should be fixed at such a distance that the mark may
be distinctly seen without altering the focus of the telescope when
adjusted to the sun or stars, which, in most cases, will require to be
at least half a mile from the place of observation, and more if it can
be obtained.

Observatories may be distinguished into public and private. A _private_
observatory may be comprehended in a comparatively small building, or
in the wing of a building of ordinary dimensions for a family, provided
the situation is adapted to it. Most of our densely-peopled towns
and cities, which abound in narrow streets and lanes, are generally
unfit for good observatories, unless at an elevated position at their
extremities. Public observatories, where a great variety of instruments
is used, and where different observers are employed, require buildings
of larger dimensions, divided into a considerable number of apartments.
The observatory of _Greenwich_ is composed principally of two separate
buildings--one of which is the observatory properly so called, where
the assistant lives and makes all his observations; the other is the
dwelling-house in which the astronomer-royal resides. The former
consists of three rooms on the ground-floor, the middle of which is
the assistant’s sitting and calculating room, furnished with a small
library of such books only as are necessary for his computations, and
an accurate clock made by the celebrated Graham, which once served Dr.
Halley as a transit-clock. Immediately over this is the assistant’s
bed-room, with an alarum to awake him to make his observations at
the proper time. The room on the eastern side of this is called the
_transit_-room, in which is an 8 feet transit instrument, with an
axis of 3 feet, resting on 2 pieces of stone, made by Mr. Bird, but
successively improved by Messrs. Dollond, Troughton and others. Here
is also a chair to observe with, the back of which lets down to any
degree of elevation that convenience may require. On the western side
is the _quadrant room_, with a stone pier in the middle running north
and south, having on its eastern face a mural quadrant of 8 feet
radius, by which observations are made on the southern quarter of the
meridian, through an opening in the roof, of 3 feet wide, produced by
means of two sliding shutters. On the western face is another mural
quadrant of 8 feet radius, the frame of which is of iron, and the arch
of brass, which is occasionally applied to the north quarter of the
meridian. In the same room is the famous zenith sector, 12 feet long,
with which Dr. Bradley made the observations which led to the discovery
of the nutation of the earth’s axis and the aberration of the light
of the fixed stars. Here are also Dr. Hooke’s reflecting quadrant and
three time-keepers by Harrison. On the south side of this room a small
wooden building is erected for the purpose of observing the eclipses
of Jupiter’s satellites, occultations of stars by the moon, and other
phenomena which require merely the use of a telescope, and the true
or mean time. It is furnished with sliding shutters on the roof and
sides to view any part of the hemisphere from the Prime Vertical down
to the southern horizon. It contains a 40-inch achromatic, with a
triple object-glass; and also a 5 feet achromatic by Messrs. John and
Peter Dollond--a 2 feet reflecting telescope by Edwards, and a 6 feet
reflector by Herschel. Above the dwelling-house is a large octagonal
room, which is made the repository for certain old instruments, and for
those which are too large to be used in the other apartments. Among
many other instruments, it contains an excellent 10 feet achromatic by
Dollond, and a 6 feet reflector by Short. Upon a platform, in an open
space, is erected the great reflecting telescope constructed by Mr.
Ramage of Aberdeen, on the Herschelian principle, which has a speculum
of 15 inches diameter, and 25 feet focal length, remarkable for the
great accuracy and brilliancy with which it exhibits celestial objects.
Various other instruments of a large size, and of modern construction,
have of late years been introduced into this observatory, such as the
large and splendid transit instrument constructed by Troughton, in
1816--the two large _mural circles_ by Troughton and Jones--the transit
clock, by Mr. Hardy, and several other instruments and apparatus which
it would be too tedious to enumerate and describe.

Every observatory, whether public or private, should be furnished with
the following instruments. 1. A transit instrument for observing the
meridian passage of the sun, planets and stars. 2. A good clock whose
accuracy may be depended upon. 3. An achromatic telescope, at least
44 inches focal distance, with powers of from 45 to 180 for viewing
planetary and other phenomena--or, a good reflecting telescope at least
3 feet long, and the speculum 5 inches diameter. 4. An equatorial
instrument, for viewing the stars and planets in the day-time, and for
finding the Right Ascension and declination of a comet, or any other
celestial phenomenon. Where this instrument is possessed, and in cases
where no great degree of accuracy is required, the equatorial may be
made to serve the general purposes of a transit instrument.

A private observatory might be constructed in any house which has a
commanding view of the heavens, provided there is an apartment in it,
in which windows may be placed, or openings cut out fronting the north,
the south, the east and the west. The author of this work has a small
observatory erected on the top of his house, which commands a view of
20 miles towards the east, 30 miles towards the west, and north-west,
and about 20 miles towards the south, at an elevation of above 200 feet
above the level of the sea, and the banks of the Tay, which are about
half a mile distant. The apartment is 12-1/2 feet long by 8-1/2 wide,
and 8-1/2 feet between the floor and the roof. It has an opening on
the north by which observations can be made on the pole-star; a window
on the south by which the meridian-passages of the heavenly bodies may
be observed; another opening towards the east, and a fourth opening,
consisting of a door, towards the west. There is a pavement of lead
on the outside, all around the observatory-room, enclosed by a stone
parapet 3-1/2 feet high, the upper part of which is coped with broad
flat stones, in certain parts of which groves or indentations are made
for receiving the feet of the pedestal of an achromatic telescope,
which form a steady support for the telescope in the open air, when
the weather is calm and serene, and when observations are intended
to be made on any region of the heavens. By placing an instrument
on this parapet, it may be directed to any point of the celestial
canopy, except a small portion near the northern horizon, which is
partly intercepted by a small hill. In the following ground-plan, fig.
91. AAA, is the parapet surrounding the observatory-room; BBB, a walk
around it nearly 3 feet broad, covered with lead. O is the apartment
for the observatory, having an opening C to the north, another opening
D to the east, E is a window which fronts the south, and F is a door
fronting the west, by which an access is obtained to the open area on
the outside. GHI is an area on the outside towards the south, covered
with lead, 15 feet long from G to H, and 6-1/2 feet from E to I, from
which a commanding view of the southern, eastern and western portions
of the heavens may be obtained: _eeee_ are positions on the top of the
parapet where a telescope may be conveniently placed, when observations
are intended to be made in the open air. The top of this parapet is
elevated about 30 feet from the level of the ground. On the roof of
the observatory, about 12 feet above its floor, on the outside is a
platform of lead, surrounded by a railing, 6 feet by 5, with a seat,
on which observations either on celestial or terrestrial objects may
occasionally be made. K is a door or hatchway, which forms an entrance
into the observatory from the apartments below, which folds down, and
forms a portion of the floor.

[Illustration: _figure 91._]

In the perspective view of the building fronting the title-page, the
position and general aspect of the observatory-part of the building may
be more distinctly perceived.

In public observatories, where zenith or polar distances require to be
measured, it is necessary that there should be a dome, with an opening
across the roof and down the north and south walls. Should an altitude
or azimuth circle, or an equatorial instrument be used, they will
require a revolving roof with openings and doors on two opposite sides,
to enable an observer to follow a heavenly body across all the cardinal
points. The openings may be about 15 inches wide, and the roof needs
not be larger than what is requisite for giving room to the observer
and the instrument, lest its bulk and weight should impede its easy
motion. There have been various plans adopted for revolving domes.
Fig. 92 represents a section of the rotatory dome constructed at East
Sheen by the Rev. Dr. Pearson. This dome turns round on three detached
spheres of lignum vitæ, in a circular bed, formed partly by the dome,
and partly by the cylindrical frame-work, which surrounds the circular
room of 9 feet diameter. A section of this bed forms a square which the
sphere just fills, so as to have a small play to allow for shrinking;
and, when the dome is carried round, the spheres, having exactly
equal diameters of 4-1/4 inches each, when placed at equal distances
from one another, keep their relative places, and move together in a
beautifully smooth manner. These spheres act as friction rollers in
two directions at the four points of contact, in case any obstacle is
opposed to their progressive motion by the admission of dirt, or by
any change of figure of the wood that composes the rings of the dome,
and of the gang-way. No groove is here made, but what the weight of
the roof resting on the hard sphere occasions. The dome itself moves
twice round for the balls once, and has, in this way, its friction
diminished. The wood of this dome is covered by Wyatt’s patent copper,
one square foot of which weighs upwards of a pound; and the copper is
so turned over the nails that fix it at the parts of junction, that not
a single nail is seen in the whole dome. This covering is intended to
render the dome more permanent than if it had been made of wood alone.
At the observatory at Cambridge the dome is made chiefly of iron. In
the figure _a_, _a_ represents one of the two oblong doors that meet
at the apex of the cone, and a piece of sheet-copper bent over the
upper end of the door which shuts last, keeps the rain from entering at
the place of junction. The two halves of the dome are united by brass
rods passing through the door-cheeks of wainscot at _a_ and _a_ by
means of nuts that screw upon their ends, which union allows the dome
to be separated into two parts when there may be occasion to displace
it. The wooden plate _bb_, which appears in a straight line, is a
circular broad ring to which the covering wainscot boards are made fast
above the eaves, and _cc_ is a similar ring forming the wall-plate or
gang-way on which the dome rests and revolves.

[Illustration: _figure 92._]

[Illustration: _figure 92_*.]

Fig. 92* shows a small door that lies over the summit of the dome, and
may be separately opened for zenith observations; the rod of metal with
a ring at the lower end passing through it, serves to open and shut
this door, and at the same time carries upon its upper end a large ball
that falls back on the roof when the door is open, and keeps the door
in a situation to be acted upon by the hook of a handle that is used
for this purpose. The doors _aa_ being curved, are made to open in two
halves, the upper one being opened first, on account of its covering
the end of the other; and the observer may open one or two doors as may
best suit his purpose. The weight of this dome is such that a couple of
wedges, inserted by a gentle blow between the rings _bb_ and _cc_, will
keep it in its situation under the influence of the strongest wind.

It may not be improper to remark, that in all observatories, and in
every apartment where celestial observations are made, there should,
if possible, be a uniform temperature; and consequently a fire should
never be kept in such places, particularly when observations are
intended to be made, as it would cause currents of air through the
doors and other openings, which would be injurious to the accuracy of
observations. When a window is opened in an ordinary apartment where a
fire is kept, there is a current of heated air which rushes out at the
top, and a current of cold air which rushes in from below, producing
agitations and undulations, which prevent even a good telescope from
showing celestial objects distinct and well defined; and, I have no
doubt, that many young observers have been disappointed in their
views of celestial phenomena, from this circumstance, when viewing
the heavenly bodies from heated rooms in cold winter evenings; as the
aërial undulations before the telescope prevent distinct vision of such
objects as the belts of Jupiter, the spots of Mars, and the rings of
Saturn.




CHAPTER IV.


ON ORRERIES OR PLANETARIUMS.

An orrery is a machine for representing the order, the motions, the
phases, and other phenomena of the planets. Although orreries and
planetariums are not so much in use as they were half a century ago,
yet as they tend to assist the conceptions of the astronomical tyro in
regard to the motions, order, and positions of the bodies which compose
the solar system, it may not be inexpedient shortly to describe the
principles and construction of some of these machines.

The reason why the name _Orrery_ was at first given to such machines,
is said to have been owing to the following circumstance. Mr. Rowley,
a mathematical-instrument-maker, having got one from Mr. George
Graham, the original inventor, to be sent abroad with some of his own
instruments, he copied it and made the first for the Earl of Orrery.
Sir R. Steele, who knew nothing of Mr. Graham’s machine--thinking to
do justice to the first encourager, as well as to the inventor of such
a curious instrument, called it an _Orrery_, and gave Mr. Rowley the
praise due to Mr. Graham. The construction of such machines is not
a modern invention. The hollow sphere of Archimedes was a piece of
mechanism of this kind, having been intended to exhibit the motions
of the sun, the moon, and the five planets, according to the Ptolemaic
system. The next orrery of which we have any account was that of
Posidonius, who lived about 80 years before the Christian era, of which
Cicero says, ‘If any man should carry the sphere of Posidonius into
Scythia or Britain, in every revolution of which the motions of the
sun, moon and five planets, were the same as in the heavens, each day
and night, who in those barbarous countries could doubt of its being
finished--not to say actuated--by perfect reason?’ The next machine of
this kind, which history records, was constructed by the celebrated
Boethius, the Christian Philosopher, about the year of Christ 510--of
which it was said ‘that it was a machine pregnant with the universe--a
portable heaven--a compendium of all things.’ After this period, we
find no instances of such mechanism of any note till the 16th century,
when science began to revive, and the arts to flourish. About this time
the curious clock in Hampton Court Palace was constructed, which shows
not only the hours of the day, but the motions of the sun and moon
through all the signs of the zodiac, and other celestial phenomena.
Another piece of mechanism of a similar kind is the clock in the
cathedral of Strasburg, in which besides the clock part, is a celestial
globe or sphere with the motions of the sun, moon, planets and the
firmament of the fixed stars, which was finished in 1574.

Among the largest and most useful pieces of machinery of this kind, is
the great sphere erected by Dr. Long in Pembroke Hall in Cambridge.
This machine, which he called the _Uranium_, consists of a planetarium
which exhibits the motion of the earth and the primary planets, the
sun, and the motion of the moon round the earth, all enclosed within a
sphere. Upon the sphere, besides the principal circles of the celestial
globe, the Zodiac is placed, of a breadth sufficient to contain the
apparent path of the moon, with all the stars over which the moon
can pass, also the ecliptic, and the heliocentric orbits of all the
planets. The Earth in the planetarium has a moveable horizon, to which
a large moveable brass circle within the sphere may be set coincident,
representing the plane of the horizon continued to the starry heavens.
The horizons being turned round sink below the stars on the east side,
and make them appear to rise, and rise above the stars on the west
side, and make them appear to set. On the other hand, the earth and the
horizon being at rest, the sphere may be turned round to represent the
apparent diurnal motion of the heavens. In order to complete his idea
on a large scale, the Doctor erected a sphere of 18 feet diameter, in
which above 30 persons might sit conveniently, the entrance to which is
over the South Pole, by six steps. The frame of the sphere consists of
a number of iron meridians, the northern ends of which are screwed to
a large round plate of brass with a hole in the centre of it; through
this hole, from a beam in the ceiling, comes the north pole, a round
iron rod about three inches long, and which supports the upper part of
the sphere, to its proper elevation for the latitude of Cambridge, so
much of it as is invisible in England being cut off, and the lower or
southern ends of the meridians terminate on, and are screwed down to a
strong circle of oak 13 feet diameter, which, when the sphere is put in
motion, runs upon large rollers of lignum vitæ, in the manner that the
tops of some wind-mills turn round. Upon the iron meridians is fixed
a zodiac of tin painted blue, on which the ecliptic and heliocentric
orbits of the planets are drawn and the stars and constellations
traced. The whole is turned round with a small winch, with as little
labour as it takes to wind up a Jack, although the weight of the iron,
tin, and the wooden circle is above a thousand pounds. This machine,
though now somewhat neglected, may still be seen in Pembroke Hall,
Cambridge, where I had an opportunity of inspecting it in November,
1839. The essential parts of the machine still remain nearly in the
same state as when originally constructed in 1758.

The machine which I shall now describe is of a much smaller and less
complex description than that which has been noticed above, and may
be made for a comparatively small expense, while it exhibits, with
sufficient accuracy, the motions, phases, and positions of all the
primary planets, with the exception of the new planets, which cannot be
accurately represented on account of their orbits crossing each other.
In order to the construction of the Planetarium to which I allude, we
must compare the proportion which the annual revolutions of the primary
planets bear to that of the Earth. This proportion is expressed in the
following table, in which the first column is the time of the Earth’s
period in days; the second, that of the planets; and the third and
fourth are numbers very nearly in the same proportion to each other.

  365-1/4  :     88      ::    83  :   20 for Mercury.
  365-1/4  :    224-2/3  ::    52  :   32 for Venus.
  365-1/4  :    687      ::    40  :   75 for Mars.
  365-1/4  :   4332-1/2  ::     7  :   83 for Jupiter.
  365-1/4  :  10759-1/3  ::     5  :  148 for Saturn.
  365-1/4  :  30686      ::     3  :  253 for Uranus.

[Illustration: _figure 93._]

On account of the number of teeth required for the wheel which moves
Uranus, it is frequently omitted in Planetariums, or the planet is
placed upon the arbor which supports Saturn. If we now suppose a
spindle or arbor with six wheels _fixed_ upon it in an horizontal
position, having the number of teeth in each corresponding to the
numbers in the third column, namely the wheel AM (fig. 93.) of 83
teeth, BL of 52, CK of 50, for the earth, DI of 40, EH of 7, and FG
of 5; and another set of wheels moving freely about an arbor having
the number of teeth in the fourth column, namely AN of 20, BO of 32,
CP of 50--for the earth; DQ of 75, ER of 83, and FS of 148. Then, if
these two arbors of fixed and moveable wheels be made of the size,
and fixed at the distance here represented, the teeth of the former
will take hold of those of the latter, and turn them freely when the
machine is in motion. These arbors, with their wheels, are to be placed
in a box of a proper size, in a perpendicular position; the arbor of
fixed wheels to move in pivots at the top and bottom of the box, and
the arbor of the moveable wheels to go through the top of the box,
and having on the top a wire fixed, and bent at a proper distance
into a right angle upwards, bearing on the top a small round ball,
representing its proper planet. If then, on the lower part of the arbor
of fixed wheels, be placed a pinion of screw-teeth, a winch turning a
spindle with an endless screw, playing in the teeth of the arbor, will
turn it with all its wheels, and these wheels will turn the others
about with their planets, in their proper and respective periods of
time. For, while the fixed wheel CK moves its equal CP once round, the
wheel AM will move AN a little more than four times round, and will
consequently exhibit the motion of Mercury; the wheel EH will turn the
wheel ER about 1/12 round, representing the proportional motion of
Jupiter; and the wheel FG will turn the wheel FS, about 1/29.5 round,
and represent the motion of Saturn, and so of all the rest.

[Illustration: _figure 94._]

The following figure (fig. 94.) represents the appearance of the
instrument when completed. Upon the upper part of the circular box
is pasted a Zodiac circle divided into 12 signs, and each sign into
30 degrees, with the corresponding days of the month. The wheel-work
is understood to be within the box, which may either be supported by
a tripod, or with four feet, as here represented. The moon, and the
satellites of Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus, are moveable only by the
hand. When the winch W is turned, then all the primary planets are
made to move in their respective velocities. The ball in the centre
represents the Sun, which is either made of brass or of wood gilded
with gold.

By this Planetarium, simple as its construction may appear, a variety
of interesting exhibitions may be made and problems performed, which
may be conducive to the instruction of young students of astronomy. I
shall mention only a few of those as specimens.

1. When the planets are placed in their respective positions by means
of an Ephemeris or the Nautical Almanack, the relative positions of
those bodies in respect to each other, the quarters of the heavens
where they may be observed, and whether they are to be seen in the
morning before sun-rise or in the evening after sun-set, may be at
once determined. For example, on the 19th of December, 1844, the
_heliocentric_ places of the planets are as follows:--Uranus 2° Aries;
Saturn 8° 27´ of Aquarius; Jupiter 7° 4´ Aries; Mars 12° 45´ Libra;
the Earth 27° 46´ Gemini; Venus 29° 48´ Virgo; Mercury 7° 53´ Pisces.
When the planets are placed on the planetarium in these positions, and
the eye placed in a line with the balls representing the Earth and the
Sun, all those situated to the left of the sun are to the east of
him, and are to be seen in the evening, and those on the right, in the
morning. In the present case, Uranus, Saturn, Jupiter, and Mercury are
evening stars, and Mars and Venus can only be seen in the morning.
Jupiter is in an aspect nearly _quartile_, or 3 signs distant from the
sun, and Uranus is nearly in the same aspect. Saturn is much nearer the
sun, and Mercury is not far from the period of its greatest _eastern_
elongation. Mars is not far from being in a quartile aspect, _west_ of
the sun, and Venus is near the same point of the heavens, approaching
to the period of its greatest _western_ elongation, and consequently
will be seen before sun-rise as a beautiful morning star. Jupiter and
Uranus, to the east of the sun, appear nearly directly opposite to
Venus and Mars, which are to the west of the sun. The phase[47] of
Venus is nearly that of a half-moon, and Mercury is somewhat gibbous,
approaching to a half-moon phase. If, now, we turn the machine by the
winch till the Index of the earth point at the 8th of August, 1845, we
shall find the planets in the following positions:--Mars and Saturn are
nearly in opposition to the sun; Venus and Mercury are evening stars at
no great distance from each other, and Jupiter is a morning star. In
like manner if we turn the machine till the Index point to any future
months, or even succeeding years, the various aspects and positions of
the planets may be plainly perceived. When the planets are moved by the
winch, in this machine, we see them all _at once_ in motion around the
sun, with the same respective velocities and periods of revolution
which they have in the heavens. As the planets are represented in the
preceding positions, Mercury, Jupiter and Mars, are evening stars,
and Venus, Saturn, and Uranus, morning stars, if we suppose the earth
placed in a line with our eye and the sun.

2. By this instrument, the truth of the Copernican or Solar system is
clearly represented. When the planets are in motion, we perceive the
planets Venus and Mercury to pass both before and behind the sun, and
to have two conjunctions. We observe Mercury to be never more than
a certain angular distance from the sun, as viewed from the earth,
namely 27°; and Venus 47°. We perceive that the superior planets,
particularly Mars, will be sometimes much nearer to the earth than at
others, and therefore must appear larger at one time than at another,
as they actually appear in the heavens. We see that the planets cannot
appear from the earth to move with uniform velocity; for when nearest
they appear to move faster, and slower when most remote. We likewise
observe that the planets appear from the earth to move sometimes
_direct_, or from west to east, then become retrograde, or from east
to west, and between both to be _stationary_. All which particulars
exactly correspond with celestial observations. For illustrating these
particulars there is a simple apparatus represented by fig. 95, which
consists of a hollow wire with a slit at top which is placed over the
arm of Mercury or Venus at E. The arm DG represents a ray of light
coming from the planet at D to the earth at F. The planets being then
in motion, the planet D, as seen in the heavens from the earth at F,
will undergo the several changes of position, which we have described
above, sometimes appearing to go backwards and at other times forwards.
The wire prop, now supposed to be placed over Mercury at E, may
likewise be placed over any of the other planets, particularly Mars,
and similar phenomena will be exhibited.

[Illustration: _figure 95._]

This machine may likewise be used to exhibit the falsity of the
Ptolemaic system, which places the Earth in the centre, and supposes
the sun and all the planets to revolve around it. For this purpose, the
ball representing the Sun is removed, and placed on the wire or pillar
which supports the Earth, and the ball representing the Earth is placed
in the centre. It will then be observed, that the planets Mercury and
Venus, being both within the orbit of the sun, cannot at any time be
seen to go behind it, whereas, in the heavens we as often see them go
behind as before the sun. Again, it shows that as the planets move in
circular orbits about the central earth, they ought at all times to
appear of the same magnitude; while, on the contrary, we observe their
apparent magnitudes in the heavens to be very variable; Mars, for
example, appearing sometimes nearly as large as Jupiter, and at other
times only like a small fixed star. Again, it is here shown that the
planets may be seen at all distances from the sun; for example, when
the sun is setting, Mercury and Venus, according to this arrangement,
might be seen, not only in the south but even in the eastern quarter
of the heavens--a phenomenon which was never yet observed in any age;
Mercury never appearing beyond 27° of the Sun, nor Venus beyond 48°.
In short, according to the system thus represented, it is seen, that
the motions of the planets should all be regular, and uniformly the
same in every part of their orbits, and that they should all move the
same way, namely from west to east; whereas, in the heavens, they are
seen to move with variable velocities, sometimes appearing stationary,
and sometimes moving from east to west, and from west to east. All
which circumstances plainly prove that the Ptolemaic cannot be the true
system of the universe.

    A Planetarium, such as that now described, might be constructed
    with brass wheel-work, for about 5 guineas. The brass
    wheel-work of one which I long since constructed cost about 3
    guineas, and the other parts of the apparatus about 2 guineas
    more. The following are the prices of some instruments of this
    kind as made by Messrs. Jones, 30, Lower Holborn, London. ‘An
    Orrery, showing the motions of the Earth, Moon, and inferior
    planets, Mercury and Venus, by wheel-work, the board on which
    the instrument moves being 13 inches diameter, £4: 14s. 6d.’ ‘A
    Planetarium showing the motions of all the primary planets by
    wheel-work with 1-1/2 inch or 3 inch papered globes,--according
    to the wheel-work and the neatness of the stands, from £7:
    17s. 6d. to £10: 10s.’ ‘Ditto, with wheel-work to show the
    parallelism of the Earth’s axis, the motions of the Moon, her
    phases, &c., £18: 18s.’ ‘Ditto, with wheel-work, to show the
    earth’s diurnal motion, on a brass stand in mahogany case, £22:
    1s.’ ‘A small _Tellurian_, showing the motion of the Earth and
    Moon, &c., £1: 8s.’


HENDERSON’S PLANETARIUM.

The following is a description of the most complete and accurate
planetarium I have yet seen. The calculations occupied more than eight
months. For this article I am indebted to my learned and ingenious
friend Dr. Henderson, F.R.A.S., who is known to many of my readers by
his excellent astronomical writings.

[Illustration: _figure 96._]

Section of the wheel-work of a Planetarium for shewing with the utmost
degree of accuracy the mean tropical revolutions of the planets round
the sun, calculated by E. Henderson, LL.D. &c.

In the above section the dark horizontal lines represent the wheel-work
of the Planetarium, and the annexed numerals, the numbers of teeth in
the given wheel. The machine has three axes or arbors, indicated by
the letters A, B, C.--Axis ‘C,’ the ‘Yearly axis,’ is assumed to make
one revolution in 365.242,236 days, or, in 365 days 5^h 48^m 49.19^s
and is furnished with wheels 17, 44, 54, 36, 140, 96, 127, 86, which
wheels are all firmly riveted to said axis, and consequently they turn
round with it in the same time. Axle ‘B’ is a fixture; it consists
of a steel rod, on which a system of pairs of wheels revolve; thus
wheels 40 and 77 are made fast together by being riveted on the same
collet represented by the thick dark space between them, as also of
the rest: the several wheels on this axis may be written down thus;
40/77, 49/129, 20/94, 79/81, 30, 27/50, 41/65, 59/65, 96, 77/47, 67/42.
On axis A a system of wheels, furnished with tubes revolve, and these
tubes carry horizontal arms, supporting perpendicular stems with the
planets. The wheels on this axis are 173, 117/190, 111, 119, 122/130,
123/127, 83, 239, 96, 128, 72. From the following short description
the nature of their several actions will, it is presumed, be readily
understood--viz.,

[Sidenote: MERCURY’S PERIOD.]

On the axis ‘C’ at the bottom is wheel 86, which turns round in 365
days 5^h 48^m 49.19^s, this wheel impels a small wheel of 22 teeth, to
which is made fast to wheel 67, both revolving together at the foot
of axis B; wheel 67 drives a wheel of 72 once round in the period of
87 days, 23^h 14^m 36.1^s: this last mentioned wheel has a long tube,
which turns on the steel axis A, and carries a horizontal arm with the
planet Mercury round the sun in the time above noted.

[Sidenote: VENUS’S PERIOD.]

On axis ‘C’ is wheel 127, which drives wheel 47, to which is riveted a
wheel of 77 teeth, which impels a wheel of 128 teeth on axis A, and
causes it to make a revolution in 224 days, 16^h 41^m 31.1^s, and is
furnished with a tube, which revolves over that of Mercury and ascends
through the cover of the machine, and bears an arm on which is placed a
small ball representing this planet in the time stated.

[Sidenote: THE EARTH’S PERIOD.]

The motion of the earth round the sun is simply effected as
follows--the assumed value of axis ‘C;’ the ‘Yearly axis’ is 365 days
5^h 48^m 49.19^s; hence a system of wheels having the same numbers of
teeth, or at all events, the first mover, and last wheel impelled must
be equal in their numbers of teeth; in this machine three wheels are
employed, thus; a wheel having 96 teeth is made fast to the Yearly
axis C and of course moves round with it in a mean solar year, as
above noted, this wheel impels another wheel of 96 teeth, on axis B,
and this in its turns drives a third wheel of 96 teeth on axis A, and
is furnished with a long tube which revolves over that of Venus, and
ascends above the cover-plate of the machine, and bears a horizontal
arm which supports a small terrestrial globe, which revolves by virtue
of said wheels once round the sun in 365 days 5^h 48^m 49.19^s.

[Sidenote: MARS’ PERIOD.]

The revolution of this planet is effected as follows--a wheel of 140
teeth is made fast to the yearly axis C, and drives on axis B a wheel
of 65 teeth, to which is fixed a wheel of 59 teeth, which impels a
large wheel of 239 teeth on axis A once round the sun in 686 days
22^h 18^m 33.6^s, this last-mentioned wheel is also furnished with a
tube which revolves over that of the earth, and carries a horizontal
arm bearing the ball representing Mars, and causes it to complete a
revolution round the sun in the period named.

[Sidenote: _THE ASTEROIDS._ VESTA’S PERIOD.]

The period of Vesta is accomplished thus, viz. On the Yearly axis C,
is made fast a wheel of 36 teeth, which drives a wheel of 65 teeth on
axis B, to which is fixed a wheel of 41 teeth, which impels a wheel of
83 teeth on axis A, once round in 1336 days 0^h 21^m 19.8^s: The tube
of which last wheel ascends on that of Mars, and like the rest bears an
arm supporting a ball representing this planet.

[Sidenote: JUNO’S PERIOD.]

For the revolution of Juno, the yearly axis C is furnished with a wheel
of 54 teeth, which impels a wheel of 50 teeth on axis B, to which is
made fast a wheel of 27 teeth which turns a wheel of 127 teeth on axis
A, once round in 1590 days 17^h 35^m 2.7^s, and the tube of which
ascends on that of Vesta, and supports a horizontal arm which carries a
small ball representing this planet in the period named.

[Sidenote: CERES’ PERIOD.]

The revolution of Ceres is derived from the period of Juno, because
wheel-work taken from the unit of a solar year was not sufficiently
accurate for the purpose, therefore on Juno’s wheel of 127 teeth is
fixed a wheel of 123 teeth, which drives a thick little bevel sort
of wheel of 30 teeth on axis B: the reason of this small wheel being
bevelled is to allow its teeth to suit both wheels 123/130; wheel 30
drives wheel 130, on axis A once round in 1681 days, 6^h 17^m 22.4^s
and the tube of wheel 130 turns on the tube of Juno, and ascends in a
similar manner with the rest and carries an horizontal arm supporting a
small ball representing this planet, and is caused to revolve round the
Sun in the above mentioned period (the period of Ceres to that of Juno
is as 130 is to 123; hence the wheels used.)

[Sidenote: PALLAS’S PERIOD.]

The Period of Pallas could not be derived from the solar year with
sufficient accuracy, and recourse was had to an engrafted fraction on
the period of Ceres, thus. On wheel 130 of Ceres is made fast a wheel
of 122 teeth, which drives a wheel of 81 teeth on axis B, to which is
fixed a wheel 79 which impels a wheel of 119 teeth on axis A, and is
furnished with a tube which ascends, and turns on that of Ceres, and
supports a horizontal arm, which bears a small ball representing this
planet, which by virtue of the above train of wheels is caused to
complete a revolution round the Sun in 1681^d 10^h 28^m 25.1^s.

[Sidenote: JUPITER’S PERIOD.]

The motion of this planet is derived from the period of a solar year;
from the ‘yearly axis’ thus, on this axis is made fast a wheel of 44
teeth which turns a wheel of 94 teeth on axis B, to which is riveted
a small wheel of 20 teeth, which impels a wheel on axis A having 111
teeth, which is furnished with an ascending tube which revolves over
that of Pallas, and bears an horizontal arm which supports a ball
representing this planet, which by the said train of wheels is caused
to revolve round the Sun in 4330^d 14^h 39^m 35.7^s.

[Sidenote: SATURN’S PERIOD.]

The periodic revolution of Saturn is also taken from the solar
year--viz., a small wheel of 17 teeth is fixed to the ‘yearly axis’
near its top, and drives a wheel of 129 teeth on axis B, to which is
made fast a wheel of 49 teeth, which turns a wheel of 190 teeth on
axis A, whose tube ascends and revolves on that of Jupiter’s tube, and
supports an arm, having a ball representing Saturn and its rings, and
which by the train of wheels is caused to perform a revolution round
the sun in the period of 10746^d 19^h 16^m 50.9^s.

URANUS’S PERIOD.

The revolution of this planet could not be attained with sufficient
accuracy from the period of a solar year--the period is engrafted on
that of Saturn’s, thus, a wheel of 117 teeth is made fast to wheel 190
of Saturn, and consequently revolves in Saturn’s period. This wheel
of 117 teeth drives a wheel on axis B, having 77 teeth, to which is
fixed a wheel of 40 teeth, which turns on axis A, a large wheel of 173
teeth, whose tube ascends and revolves over that of Saturn, and carries
a horizontal arm which supports a ball representing this planet, which
is caused to complete its revolution by such a train of wheels in the
period of 30589^d 8^h 26^m 58.4^s. Such is a brief description of the
motions of this comprehensive and very accurate machine.

The axis A, on which the planetary tubular wheels revolve, performs
a rotation in 25 days 10 hours, by virtue of the following train of
wheels, 61/14 + 70/12 of 24 hours, that is, a pinion of 14 is assumed
to revolve in 24 hours, and to drive a wheel of 61 teeth, to which is
fixed a pinion of 12, which turns the wheel 70 in the period noted; to
this wheel-axis, it is made fast, and by revolving with it, exhibits
the Sun’s rotation.

[Sidenote: DIURNAL HAND.]

The machine is turned by a handle or winch, which is assumed to turn
round in 24 hours, and from this rotation of 24 hours a train of
wheel-work is required to cause the ‘yearly axis’ C, to turn once
round in 365^d 5^h 48^m 49.19^s, which is effected in the following
manner--viz, the train found by the process of the reduction of
continuous fractions is 61/14 + 144/18 + 211/23 that is, in the train
for turning the sun, the same pinion 14 turns the same wheel 61,
and turns a pinion of 18 leaves, to which is fixed a wheel of 144
teeth, having a pinion of 23 leaves, which impels a large wheel of
241 teeth once round in 365.242236^d or 365^d 5^h 48^m 49.19^s, this
last-mentioned wheel of 241 teeth is made fast to the under part of
the ‘yearly axis’ C at D, the handle having a pinion of 14 leaves
therefore, and transmitting its motion through the above train, causes
the yearly axis to revolve in the same period.

[Sidenote: REGISTRATING DATES.]

The planetarium is also furnished with a system of wheels for
registrating dates for either 10,000 years past or to come, the
arrangement is not shewn in the engraving (to prevent confusion) but
it might be shortly described thus:--Near the top of the yearly axis
is a hooked piece _e_, which causes the tooth of a wheel of 100 teeth
to start forward yearly, consequently 100 starts of said wheel will
cause it to revolve in 100 solar years, and it has a hand which points
on a dial on the cover of the machine the years; thus for the present
year this hand will be over the number 45. This last-named wheel of
100 teeth has a pin which causes a tooth of another wheel of 100 teeth
to start once in 100 years, hence this last wheel will complete one
revolution in 10,000 years, and it is for this purpose the former index
or hand moves over a number yearly. The second index will pass over a
number every 100 years--for the present year the second hand or index
will be over the number 18, and will continue over it until the first
index moves forward to 99, then both indexes will move at one time,
viz., the first index to 00 on the first concentric circle of the
dial, and the second index to 19, denoting the year 1900, and so of
the rest. By the ecliptic being divided in a series of four spirals,
the machine makes a distinction between common and leap years, and
indicates the common year as containing 365 days, and the leap-year 366
days, by taking in a day in February every fourth year; thus for any
given period for 10,000 years past or to come, the various situations
and aspects of the planets may be ascertained by operating with this
machine, and this for thousands of years without producing a sensible
error either in space or time. This planetarium wheel-work is enclosed
in an elegant mahogany box of twelve sides--is about 5 feet in diameter
by 10 inches in depth; at each of the twelve angles, or sides, small
brass pillars rise and support a large Ecliptic circle on which are
engraven the signs, degrees and minutes of the Ecliptic--the days of
the month, &c. This mahogany box with the wheel-work is supported by a
tripod stand three feet in height, and motion is communicated to the
several balls representing the planets by turning the handle as before
described. A Planetarium of this complicated sort, costs sixty guineas.

In the month of October last year, Dr. Henderson made a series of
calculations for a new Planetarium for the use of schools. It shows
with considerable accuracy for 700 days, the mean tropical revolutions
of the Planets round the sun--the machine consists of a system of brass
wheels peculiarly arranged, and is enclosed in a circular case three
feet in diameter, the top of which has the signs and degrees of the
ecliptic laid down on it, as also the days of the months, &c. This
Planetarium costs only 45s. or on a tripod stand, table-high, 55s.; the
machine is put in motion by a handle on the outside. To the teachers
and others connected with education this Planetarium must be of great
importance, for without a proper elucidation of the principles of
astronomy, that of Geography must be but confusedly understood. This
Planetarium is at present made by Mr. Dollond, 9, White Conduit Grove,
Islington, London.

The _Tellurian_ is a small instrument which should be used in
connection with the Planetarium formerly described. This instrument is
intended to show the annual motion of the earth, and the revolution
of the moon around it. It also illustrates the moon’s phases, and the
motion of her nodes, the inclination of the Earth’s axis, the causes
of eclipses, the variety of seams, and other phenomena. It consists of
about eight wheels, pinions and circles. A small instrument of this
description may be purchased for about one pound eight shillings, as
stated in the note, page 527.


ON THE VARIOUS OPINIONS WHICH WERE ORIGINALLY FORMED OF SATURN’S RING.

[Illustration: _figure 97._]

The striking and singular phenomenon connected with the planet
Saturn--though now ascertained beyond dispute to be a Ring, or Rings,
surrounding its body at a certain distance--was a subject of great
mystery, and gave rise to numerous conjectures and controversies, for
a considerable time after the invention of the telescope by which it
was discovered. Though it was first discovered in the year 1610, it
was nearly 50 years afterwards, before its true form and nature were
determined. Galileo was the first who discovered anything uncommon
connected with Saturn: through his telescope he thought he saw that
planet appear like two smaller globes on each side of a larger one; and
after viewing the planet in this form for two years, he was surprised
to see it becoming quite round, without its adjoining globes, and
some time afterwards to appear in the triple form. This appearance
is represented in fig. 1 of the above engraving. In the year 1614,
Scheiner, a German astronomer, published a representation of Saturn,
in which this planet is exhibited as a large central globe, with two
smaller bodies, one on each side, partly of a conical form, attached to
the planet and forming a part of it, as shown fig. 2. In the year 1640
and 1643, Ricciolus, an Italian mathematician and astronomer, imagined
he saw Saturn as represented in fig. 3. consisting of a central
globe, and two conical shaped bodies completely detached from it, and
published an account of it corresponding to this view. Hevelius, the
celebrated astronomer of Dantzig, author of the _Selenographia_ and
other works, made many observations on this planet about the years
1643, 1649 and 1650, in which he appears to have obtained different
views of the planet and its appendages, gradually approximating to the
truth, but still incorrect. These views are represented in figures
4, 5, 6, and 7. Fig. 4 nearly resembles two hemispheres, one on each
side of the globe of Saturn. The other figures very nearly resemble
the extreme parts of the ring as seen through a good telescope, but
he still seems to have considered them as detached from each other as
well as from Saturn. Figures 8 and 9 are views given by Ricciolus at a
period posterior to that in which he supposed Saturn and his appendages
in the form delineated in fig. 3. In these last delineations the
planet was supposed to be enclosed in an elliptical ring, but this ring
was supposed to be _fixed_ to its two opposite sides.

Fig. 10, is a representation by Eustachius Divini, a celebrated
Italian optician at Bologna. The shades represented on Saturn and the
elliptical curve are incorrect, as this planet presents no such shadowy
form. The general appearance here presented is not much unlike that
which the ring of Saturn exhibits, excepting that at the upper side the
ring should appear covering a portion of the orb of Saturn. But Divini
seems to have conceived that the curve on each side was attached to the
body of Saturn. For when Huygens published his discovery of the ring
of Saturn in 1659, Divini contested its truth, because he could not
perceive the ring through his own telescopes; and he wrote a treatise
on the subject in opposition to Huygens, in 1660, entitled ‘Brevis
Annotatio in Systema Saturninum.’ Huygens immediately replied to him,
and Divini wrote a rejoinder in 1661.--Fig. 11 is the representation
given by Francis Fontana, a Neapolitan astronomer. This figure
represents Saturn as having two crescents, one on each side, attached
to its body, with intervals between the planet and the crescents. Fig.
12 is a view delineated by Gassendus, a celebrated French philosopher.
It represents the planet as a large ellipsoid, having a large circular
opening near each end, and, if this representation were the true one,
each opening would be at least 30,000 miles in diameter. Fig. 13,
which is perhaps the most singular of the whole, is said to be one
of the view’s of this planet given by Ricciolus. It represents two
globes--each of which, in the proportion they here bear to Saturn, must
be more than thirty thousand miles in diameter. These globes, were
conceived as being attached to the body of Saturn by curves or bands,
each of which, in the proportion represented, must have been at least
7000 miles in breadth, and nearly 40,000 miles long. This would have
exhibited the planet Saturn as a still more singular body than what
we have found it to be; but no such construction of a planet has yet
been found in the universe, nor is it probable that such a form of a
planetary body exists.

It is remarkable that only two general opinions should have been
formed respecting the construction of Saturn--as appears from these
representations--either that this planet was composed of three distinct
parts, separate from each other,--or that the appendage on each side
was _fixed_ to the body of the planet. The idea of a ring surrounding
the body of the planet, at a certain distance from every part of it,
seems never to have been thought of till the celebrated Huygens, in
1655, 1656 and 1657, by numerous observations made on this planet,
completely demonstrated that it is surrounded by a solid and permanent
ring, which never changes its situation, and, without touching the
body of the planet, accompanies it in its revolution around the sun.
As the cause of all the erroneous opinions above stated was owing to
the imperfection of the telescopes which were then in use, and their
deficiency in magnifying power,--this ingenious astronomer set himself
to work in order to improve telescopes for celestial observations. He
improved the art of grinding and polishing object-glasses, which he
finished with his own hands, and produced lenses of a more correct
figure, and of a longer focal distance than what had previously been
accomplished. He first constructed a telescope 12 feet long, and
afterwards one 23 feet long, which magnified about 95 times; whereas
Galileo’s best telescope magnified only about 33 times. He afterwards
constructed one 123 feet long, which magnified about 220 times. It was
used without a tube, the object-glass being placed upon the top of a
pole and connected by a cord with the eye-piece. With such telescopes
this ingenious artist and mathematician discovered the fourth satellite
of Saturn, and demonstrated that the phenomenon, which had been so
egregiously misrepresented by preceding astronomers, consisted of an
immense ring surrounding the body, and completely detached from it. His
numerous observations and reasonings on this subject were published
in Latin, in 1659, in a quarto volume of nearly 100 pages, entitled
‘_Systema Saturnium, sive de causis mirandorum Saturni Phenomenôn, et
Comite ejus Planeta Nova_,’ from which work the figures and some of the
facts stated above have been extracted.


ON THE SUPPOSED DIVISIONS OF THE EXTERIOR RING OF SATURN.

From the period in which Huygens lived till the time when Herschel
applied his large telescopes to the heavens, few discoveries were made
in relation to Saturn. Cassini, in 1671, discovered the fifth satellite
of this planet; in 1672, the third; and the first and second in March,
1684. In 1675, Cassini saw the broad side of its ring bisected quite
round by a dark elliptical line, of which the inner part appeared
brighter than the outer. In 1722, Mr. Hadley, with his 5 feet Newtonian
Reflector observed the same phenomenon, and perceived that the dark
line was stronger next the body, and fainter towards the upper edge
of the ring. Within the ring he also discovered two belts across the
disk of Saturn. But it does not appear that they had any idea that this
dark line was empty space separating the ring into two parts. This
discovery was reserved for the late Sir W. Herschel, who made numerous
observations on this planet, and likewise ascertained that the ring
performs a revolution round the planet in ten hours and thirty minutes.

Of late years, some observers have supposed that the exterior ring
of Saturn is divided into several parts, or, in other words, that it
consists of two or more concentric rings. The following are some of
the observations on which this opinion is founded. They are chiefly
extracted from Captain Kater’s Paper on this subject, which was read
before the Astronomical Society of London.

The observations, we are told, were made in the years 1825 and 1826,
and remained unpublished, from a wish on the part of the observer
to witness the appearances again. The planet Saturn has been much
observed by Captain Kater, for the purpose of trying the light, &c.,
for which the ring and satellites are good tests. The instruments
which were employed in the present investigations were two Newtonian
Reflectors--one by Watson, of 40 inches focus and 6-1/4 aperture; and
another by Dollond, of 68 inches focus, and 6-3/4 aperture. The first,
under favourable circumstances, gave a most excellent image, the latter
is a very good instrument. The following are extracts from the author’s
journal.

_Nov. 25, 1825._--The double ring beautifully defined, perfectly
distinct all around, and the principal belts well seen. I tried many
concave glasses, and found that the image was much sharper than with
convex eye-glasses, and the light apparently much greater. Dollond,
259, the best power, 480, a single lens, very distinct. _Nov. 30_, the
night very favourable, but not equal to the 25th. The exterior ring
of Saturn is not so bright as the interior, and the interior is less
bright close to the edge next the planet. The inner edge appears more
yellow than the rest of the ring, and nearer in colour to the body
of the planet. _Dec. 17_.--The evening extremely fine. With Dollond,
I perceived the outer ring of Saturn to be darker than the inner,
and the division of the ring all around with perfect distinctness;
but with Watson I fancied that I saw _the outer ring separated by
numerous dark divisions extremely close, one stronger than the rest,
dividing the ring about equally_. This was seen with my most perfect
single eye-glass power. A careful examination of some hours confirmed
this opinion.--_Jan. 16_ and 17, 1826.--Captain Kater believed that
he saw the divisions with the Dollond, but was not positive. Concave
eye-glasses found to be superior to convex. _Feb. 26, 1826_.--The
division of the outer ring not seen with Dollond. On the 17th Dec.,
when the divisions were most distinctly seen, Captain Kater made a
drawing of the appearance of Saturn and his rings. The phenomena
were witnessed by two other persons on the same evening, one of whom
saw several divisions in the outer ring, while the other saw one
middle division only; but the latter person was short-sighted, and
unaccustomed to telescopic observations. It may be remarked, however,
that these divisions were not seen on other evenings, which yet were
considered very favourable for distinct vision.

It is said that the same appearances were seen by Mr. Short, but the
original record of his observations cannot be found. In Lalande’s
_Astronomy_ (3rd edition, article 3351,) it is said, ‘Cassini remarked
that the breadth of the ring was divided into two equal parts by a
dark line having the same curvature as the ring, and the _exterior_
portion was the less bright. Short _told_ me that he observed still
more singular phenomena with his large telescope of 12 feet. The
breadth of the ansæ, or extremities of the ring; was, according to him,
divided into two parts,--an inner portion without any break in the
illumination, and an outer divided by several lines concentric with the
circumference; which would lead to a belief, _that there are several
rings in the same plane_.’ De Lambre and Birt severally state that
Short saw the outer ring divided, probably on the authority of Lalande.
In Brewster’s _Ferguson’s Astronomy_, vol. ii, p. 125, 2nd edition,
there is the following note on this subject. ‘Mr. Short assures us,
that with an excellent telescope, he observed the surface of the ring
divided by several dark concentric lines, which seem to indicate a
number of rings proportional to the number of dark lines which he
perceived.’

In Dec. 1813, at Paris, Professor Quetelet saw the outer ring divided
with the achromatic telescope of 10 inches aperture, which was
exhibited at the exposition. He mentioned this the following day to M.
de la Place, who observed, that ‘those or even more divisions, were
conformable to the system of the world.’ On the other hand the division
of the outer ring was not seen by Sir W. Herschel in 1792, nor by Sir
J. Herschel in 1826, nor by Struve in the same year; and on several
occasions when the atmospheric conditions were most favourable, it
has not been seen by Captain Kater. It has been remarked by Sir W.
Herschel, Struve and others, that the exterior ring is much less
brilliant than the interior. And it is asked, may not this want of
light in the outer ring arise from its having a very dense atmosphere?
and may not this atmosphere in certain states admit of the divisions
of the exterior ring being seen, though, under other circumstances,
they remain invisible? The above observations are said to have been
confirmed by some recent observations by Decuppis at Rome, who
announced, some years ago, that Saturn’s outer ring is divided into two
or three concentric rings.

Some of the observations stated above, were they perfectly correct,
would lead to the conclusion that Saturn is encompassed with a number
of rings, concentric with and parallel to each other. But while such
phenomena as described above are so seldom seen, even by the most
powerful telescopes and the most accurate observers, a certain degree
of doubt must still hang over the subject; and we must suspend our
opinion on this point, till future observations shall either confirm
or render doubtful those to which we have referred. Should the Earl
of Rosse’s great telescope, when finished for observation, be found
to perform according to the expectations now entertained, and in
proportion to its size and quantity of light, we shall expect that our
doubts will be resolved in regard to the supposed divisions of the ring
of Saturn.




APPENDIX.


BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE EARL OF ROSSE’S TELESCOPE.

This telescope, the largest and most magnificent that ever was
attempted, reflects the greatest honour on the genius, the inventive
powers, and the scientific acquirements of its noble contriver, as
well as on the elevated station in which he is placed. With rank and
fortune, and every circumstance that usually unfit men for scientific
pursuit, he has set a bright example to his compeers of the dignity and
utility of philosophical studies and investigations, and of the aids
they might render to the progress of science, were their wealth and
pursuits directed in a proper channel.

Previously to his Lordship’s attempting the construction of his
largest--or ‘Monster Telescope,’ he had constructed one with a speculum
of 3 feet in diameter, which was considered one of the most accurate
and powerful instruments that had ever been made, not excepting even
Sir W. Herschel’s forty-feet Reflector. In the account of this
telescope, published in the Philosophical Transactions for 1840,
his Lordship speaks of the possibility of a speculum of six feet in
diameter being cast. At that time, it was considered by some as little
short of a chimera to attempt the construction of such a monstrous
instrument. But the idea no sooner occurred to this ingenious and
persevering nobleman than he determined to put it to the test, and the
result has been attended with complete success. The materials of which
this speculum is composed are _copper_ and _tin_, united very nearly
in their atomic proportions, namely, copper 126.4 parts, to tin 58.9
parts. This compound has a specific gravity of 8.8, and it is found to
preserve its lustre with more splendor, and to be more free from pores
than any other. A foundry was constructed expressly for the purpose of
casting the speculum. Its chimney built from the ground was 18 feet
high, and 16-1/2 square at the base, tapering to four at the top. At
each of its sides, communicating with it by flue, was sunk a furnace
8 feet deep, and 5-1/2 square, with a circular opening 4 feet in
diameter. About seven feet from the chimney was erected a large crane,
with the necessary tackle for elevating and carrying the crucibles from
the furnace to the mould, which was placed in a line with the chimney
and crane, and had three iron baskets supported on pivots hung round
it; and four feet farther on was the annealing oven. The crucibles
which contained the metal were each 2 feet in diameter, 2-1/2 deep,
and together weighed one ton and a half; they were of cast iron and
made to fit the baskets at the side of the mould. These baskets were
hung on wooden uprights or pivots, to one of these on each side was
attached a lever, by depressing which it might be turned over, and
the contents of the crucible poured into the mould. The bottom of the
mould was made by binding together tightly layers of hoop-iron, and
turning the required shape on them edgewise. This mould conducted the
heat away through the bottom, and cooled the metal towards the top in
infinitely small layers, while the interstices, though close enough to
prevent the metal from escaping, were sufficiently open to allow the
air to penetrate. This bottom was six feet in diameter and 5-1/2 inches
thick, and was made perfectly horizontal by means of spirit levels, and
was surrounded by a wooden frame; a wooden pattern, the exact size of
the speculum, being placed on the iron; sand was well packed between
it and the frame, and the pattern was removed. Each of the crucibles
containing the melted metal was then placed in its basket, and every
thing being ready for discharging their contents, they were at the same
instant turned over, and the mould being filled, the metal in a short
time safely set into the required figure. Whilst it was red hot, and
scarcely solid, the frame-work was removed, and an iron ring connected
with a bar which passed through the oven, being placed round it, it
was drawn in by means of a capstan at the other side, on a railroad,
when charcoal being lighted in the oven, and turf fires underneath
it, all the openings were built up, and it was left for sixteen weeks
to anneal. It was cast on the 13th of April, 1842, at 9 o’clock in
the evening. The crucibles were ten hours heating in the furnaces
before the metal was introduced, which in about ten hours more was
sufficiently fluid to be poured. When the oven was opened the speculum
was found as perfect as when it entered it. It was then removed to the
grinding machine, where it underwent that process, and afterwards was
polished, without any accident having occurred.

This speculum weighed _three tons_, and lost about one eighth of
an inch in grinding. Lord Rosse has since cast another speculum of
the same diameter four tons in weight. He can now, with perfect
confidence, undertake any casting, so great an improvement has the
form of mould which he has invented proved. The speculum was placed
on an equilibrium bed, composed of nine pieces resting on points at
their centres of gravity; the pieces were lined with pitch and felt,
before the speculum was placed on them. The speculum box is also lined
with felt and pitched; this prevents any sudden change of temperature
affecting the speculum by means of the bad conducting power of the
substances employed. A vessel of lime is kept in connection with the
speculum-box to absorb the moisture, which otherwise might injure the
mirror. The process of grinding was conducted under water, and the
moving power employed was a steam-engine of three-horse power. The
Polisher is connected with the machinery by means of a large ring of
iron, which loosely encircles it; and instead of either the speculum
or the polisher being stationary, both move with a regulated speed;
the ring of the polisher, and therefore the polisher itself, has a
transverse and a longitudinal motion; it makes 80 strokes in the
minute, and 24-1/2 strokes backward and forward for every revolution
of the mirror, and at the same time 1-72/100 strokes in the transverse
direction. The extent of the latter is 27/100 of the diameter of the
speculum. The substance made use of to wear down the surface was emery
and water, a constant supply of these was kept between the grinder
and the speculum. The Grinder is made of cast iron, with grooves
cut lengthways, across and circularly on its face. The polisher and
speculum have a mutual action upon each other; in a few hours, by the
help of the emery and water, they are both ground truly circular,
whatever may have been their previous defects. The grinding is
continued till the required form of surface is produced; and this is
ascertained in the following manner. There is a high tower over the
house in which the speculum is ground, on the top of which is fixed a
pole, to which is attached the dial of a watch; there are trap doors
which open, and by means of a temporary eye-piece, allow the figure
of the dial to be seen in the speculum brought to a slight polish. If
the dots on the dial are not sufficiently well-defined, the grinding
is continued; but if they appear satisfactorily, the polishing is
commenced. It required six weeks to grind it to a fair surface. The
polisher was cut into grooves, to prevent the abraded matter from
accumulating in some places more than in others--a thin layer of pitch
was spread over it, it was smeared over with rouge and water, and a
supply of it kept up till the machinery brought it to a fine black
polish. The length of time employed for polishing the 3 feet speculum
was six hours.[48]

This large telescope is now completed, or nearly so. The tube is 56
feet long, including the speculum box, and is made of deal, one inch
thick, hooped with iron. On the inside, at intervals of 8 feet, there
are rings of iron 3 inches in depth and 1 inch broad, for the purpose
of strengthening the sides. The diameter of the tube is 7 feet. It is
fixed to mason-work, in the ground, to a large universal hinge which
allows it to turn in all directions. At 12 feet distance, on each side,
a wall is built, 72 feet long, 48 high on the outer side, and 56 on
the inner--the walls being 24 feet distant from each other, and lying
exactly in the meridional line. When directed to the south, the tube
may be lowered till it become almost horizontal; but when pointed to
the north, it only falls till it is parallel with the earth’s axis,
pointing then to the pole of the heavens. Its lateral movements take
place only from wall to wall, and this commands a view for half an hour
on each side of the meridian--that is, the whole of its motion from
east to west is limited to 15 degrees. At present it is fitted up in a
temporary way to be used as a Transit instrument; but it is ultimately
intended to connect with the tube-end galleries, machinery which shall
give an automaton movement, so that the telescope shall be used as an
Equatorial Instrument. All the works connected with this instrument
are of the strongest and safest kind; all the iron-work was cast in
his Lordship’s laboratory by men instructed by himself, and every part
of the machinery was made under his own eye, by the artizans in his
own neighbourhood, and not a single accident worth mentioning happened
during the whole proceeding.

The expence incurred by his Lordship in the erection of this noble
instrument was not less than _twelve thousand pounds_! besides the
money expended in the construction of the telescope of three feet
diameter. Sufficient time has not yet been afforded for making
particular observations with this telescope; but from slight trials
which have been made, even under unfavourable circumstances, it
promises important results. Its great superiority over every telescope
previously constructed consists in the great quantity of light it
reflects, and the brilliancy with which it exhibits objects even when
high powers are applied. It has a reflecting surface of 4,071 square
inches, while that of Herschel’s 40-feet telescope had only 1811 square
inches on its polished surface, so that the quantity of light reflected
from the speculum is considerably more than double that of Herschel’s
largest reflector. This instrument has already exceeded his Lordship’s
expectations. Many appearances before invisible in the Moon, have been
perceived, and there is every reason to expect that new discoveries
will be made by it in the _Nebulæ_, double and triple stars, and other
celestial objects. The following is an extract of a communication
from Sir James South, on this subject, addressed to the Editor of the
‘_Times_.’ ‘The leviathan telescope on which the Earl of Rosse has
been toiling upwards of two years, although not absolutely finished,
was on Wednesday last directed to the Sidereal Heavens. The letter
which I have this morning received from its noble maker, in his usual
unassuming stile, merely states, that the metal only just polished,
was of a pretty good figure, and that with a power of 500, the nebula
known as No. 2., of Messier’s catalogue, was even more magnificent than
the nebula, No. 13 of Messier, when seen with his Lordship’s telescope
of 3 feet diameter, and 27 feet focus. Cloudy weather prevented him
from turning the leviathan on any other nebulous object. Thus, then,
we have all danger of the metal breaking before it could be polished,
overcome. Little more, however, will be done with it for some time, as
the Earl is on the eve of quitting Ireland for England to resign his
post at York as President of the British Association. I look forward
with intense anxiety to witness its first severe trial, when all its
various appointments shall be completed, in the confidence that those
who may then be present, will see with it what man has never seen
before. The diameter of the large metal is 6-feet, and its focus 54
feet; yet the immense mass is manageable by one man. Compared with
it, the working telescopes of Sir William Herschel, which in his
hands conferred on astronomy such inestimable service, and on himself
astronomical immortality, were but playthings.’

The following is a more recent account of observations made by this
telescope, chiefly extracted from Sir James South’s description of
this telescope, inserted in the _Times_ of April 16th, 1845, and the
‘_Illustrated London News_’ of April 19.

‘The night of the 5th of March, 1845, was the finest I ever saw in
Ireland. Many nebulæ were observed by Lord Rosse, Dr. Robinson and
myself. Most of them were for the first time since their creation,
seen by us as groups or clusters of stars; while some, at least to
my eyes, showed no such resolution. Never, however, in my life did
I see such glorious sidereal pictures as this instrument afforded
us. Most of the nebulæ we saw I certainly have observed with my own
large achromatic; but although that instrument, as far as relates to
magnifying power, is probably inferior to no one in existence, yet to
compare these nebulæ, as seen with it and the 6-feet telescope, is like
comparing, as seen with the naked eye, the dinginess of the planet
Saturn to the brilliancy of Venus. The most popularly-known nebulæ
observed this night were the ring nebulæ in the _Canes Venatici_, or
the 51st of Messier’s catalogue, which was resolved into stars with a
magnifying power of 548, and the 94th of Messier, which is in the same
constellation, and which was resolved into a large globular cluster of
stars, not much unlike the well-known cluster in Hercules, called also
13th Messier.’ Perfection of figure, however, of a telescope, must be
tested, not by nebulæ, but by its performance on a star of the first
magnitude. If it will, under high power, show the star round and free
from optical appendages, we may safely take it for granted it will not
only show nebulæ well, but any other celestial object as it ought.
To determine this point, the telescope was directed to _Regulus_,
with the entire aperture, and a power of 800, and ‘I saw’ says Sir
James, ‘with inexpressible delight, the star free from wings, tails or
optical appendages; not indeed like a planetary disk, as in my large
achromatic, but as a round image resembling voltaic light between
charcoal points; and so little aberration had this brilliant image,
that I could have measured its distance from, and position with any of
the stars in the field with a spider’s line micrometer, and a power of
1,000, without the slightest difficulty; for, not only was the large
star round, but the telescope, although in the open air, and the wind
blowing rather fresh, was as steady as a rock.’

‘On subsequent nights, observations of other nebulæ, amounting to some
30 or more, removed most of them from the list of nebulæ, where they
had long figured, to that of clusters; while some of these latter, more
especially 5 Messier, exhibited a sidereal picture in the telescope
such as man before had never seen, and which for its magnificence
baffles all description. Several double stars were seen with various
apertures of the telescope, and with powers between 360 and 800; and
as the Earl had told us before we should,--before the speculum was
inserted in the tube, in consequence of his having been obliged to quit
the superintendence of the polishing at the most critical part of the
process,--we found that a ring of about 6 inches broad, reckoning from
the circumference of the speculum, was not perfectly polished, and to
_that_ the little irradiation seen about Regulus was unquestionably
referable. The only double stars of the 1st class which the weather
permitted us to examine with it were Xi Ursæ Majoris, and Gamma
Virginis, which I could have measured with the greatest confidence.
D’Arrest’s comet we observed on the 12th of March, with a power of
400, but nothing worthy of notice was detected. Of the Moon, a few
words must suffice. Its appearance in my large achromatic of 12 inches
aperture is known to hundreds of readers; let them then imagine that
with it they look _at_ the moon, whilst with Lord Rosse’s 6 feet they
look _into it_, and they will not form a very erroneous opinion of
the performance of the Leviathan. On the 15th of March, when the moon
was 7 days old, I never saw her unilluminated disk so beautifully,
nor her mountains so temptingly measurable. On my first looking into
the telescope, a star of about the 7th magnitude was some minutes of
a degree from the moon’s dark limb, and its occultation by the moon
appeared inevitable. The star, however, instead of disappearing the
moment the moon’s edge came in contact with it, apparently glided on
the moon’s dark face, as if it had been seen through a transparent
moon, or as if the star were between me and the moon. It remained on
the moon’s disk nearly two seconds of time, and then disappeared. I
have seen this apparent projection of a star on the moon’s face several
times, but from the great brilliancy of the star, this was the most
beautiful I ever saw. The cause of this phenomenon is involved in
impenetrable mystery.’

The following is a representation of the Great Rosse Telescope, along
with part of the buildings with which it is connected. In the interior
face of the eastern wall a very strong iron arc of about 43 feet radius
is firmly fixed, provided with adjustments, whereby its surface facing
the telescope may be set very accurately in the plane of the meridian.
On this bar, lines are drawn, the interval between any adjoining two of
which, corresponds to one minute of time on the Equator. The tube and
speculum, including the bed on which the speculum rests, weigh about
15 tons. The telescope rests on an universal joint placed on masonry
about 6 feet below the ground, and is elevated or depressed by a chain
and windlass; and although it weighs about 15 tons, the instrument is
raised by two men with great facility. Of course, it is counterpoised
in every direction. The observer when at work, stands in one of four
galleries, the three highest of which are drawn out from the western
wall, while the fourth or lowest has for its base an elevating
platform, along the horizontal surface of which a gallery slides from
wall to wall by a machinery within the observer’s reach, but which
a child may work. When the telescope is about half an hour east of
the meridian, the galleries, hanging over the gap between the walls,
present to a spectator below an appearance somewhat dangerous; yet the
observer, with common prudence, is as safe as on the ground, and each
of the galleries can be drawn from the wall to the telescope’s side so
readily, that the observer needs no one else to move it for him.

[Illustration: _figure 98._]

The above figure represents only the upper part of the tube of the
telescope, at which the observer stands when making his observations.
The telescope is at present of the Newtonian construction, and
consequently, the observer looks into the side of the tube at the upper
end of the telescope, but it is proposed to throw aside the plane
speculum, and to adapt it to the _Front view_, on the plan already
described (see pp. 306, 313, &c.) so that the observer will sit or
stand with his back towards the object, and his face looking down upon
the speculum; and, in this position, he will sometimes be elevated
between 50 and 60 feet above the ground. As yet, the telescope has no
equatorial motion, but it very shortly will; and at no very distant
day, clock-work will be connected with it, when the observer will,
while observing, be almost as comfortable, as if he were reading at a
desk by his fire-side.

[Illustration: _figure 99._]

The following figure shews a section of the machinery connected with
this telescope. It exhibits a view of the inside of the eastern wall,
with all the machinery as seen in section. A is the mason-work on the
ground, B the universal joint, which allows the tube to turn in all
directions; C the speculum in its tube; D the box; E the eye-piece; F
the moveable pulley; G the fixed one; H the chain from the side of the
tube; I the chain from the beam; K the counterpoise; L the lever; M
the chain connecting it with the tube; Z the chain which passes from
the tube to the windlass over a pulley on a truss-beam which runs from
W to the same situation on the opposite wall--the pulley is not seen.
X is a railroad on which the speculum is drawn either to or from its
box; part is cut away to show the counterpoise. The dotted line _a_
represents the course of the weight R as the tube rises or falls; it
is a segment of a circle of which the chain I is the radius. The tube
is moved from wall to wall by the ratchet and wheel at R; the wheel is
turned by the handle O, and the ratchet is fixed to the circle on the
wall. The ladders in front, as shown in the preceding sketch, enable
the observer to follow the tube in its ascent to where the galleries on
the side wall commence; these side galleries are three in number, and
each can be moved from wall to wall by the observer, after the tube,
the motion of which he also accomplishes by means of the handle O.

I shall conclude the description of this wonderful instrument in the
words of Sir James South.

‘What will be the power of this telescope when it has its Le Mairean
form’ [that is, when it is fitted up with the front view] ‘it is not
easy to divine;--what nebulæ will it resolve into stars; in what nebulæ
will it not find stars;--how many satellites of Saturn will it show
us;--how many will it indicate as appertaining to Uranus;--how many
nebulæ never yet seen by mortal eye, will it present to us;--what spots
will it show us on the various planets; will it tell us what causes
the variable brightness of many of the fixed stars;--will it give us
any information as to the constitution of the planetary nebulæ;--will
it exhibit to us any satellites encircling them; will it tell us
why the satellites of Jupiter, which generally pass over Jupiter’s
face as disks nearly of white light, sometimes traverse it as black
patches;--will it add to our knowledge of the physical construction of
nebulous stars;--of that mysterious class of bodies which surround
some stars, called, for want of a better name, ‘photospheres;’--will
it show the annular nebulæ of Lyra, merely as a brilliant luminous
ring, or will it exhibit it as thousands of stars arranged in all the
symmetry of an ellipse; will it enable us to comprehend the hitherto
incomprehensible nature and origin of the light of the great nebulæ
of Orion;--will it give us, in easily appreciable quantity, the
parallax of some of the fixed stars, or will it make sensible to us
the parallax of the nebulae themselves;--finally, having presented to
us original portraits of the moon and of the sidereal heavens, such as
man has never dared even to anticipate--will it, by Daguerreotype aid,
administer to us copies founded upon truth, and enable astronomers of
future ages to compare the moon and heavens as they then may be, with
the moon and heavens as they were? Some of these questions will be
answered affirmatively, others negatively, and that, too, very shortly;
for the noble maker of the noblest instrument ever formed by man, “has
cast his bread upon the waters, and will, with God’s blessing, find it
before many days.”’


HINTS TO AMATEURS IN ASTRONOMY RESPECTING THE CONSTRUCTION OF
TELESCOPES.

As there are many among the lower ranks of the community who have a
desire to be possessed of a telescope, which will show them some of the
prominent features of celestial scenery, but who are unable to purchase
a finished instrument at the prices usually charged by Opticians, the
following hints may perhaps be acceptable to those who are possessed of
a mechanical genius.

The lenses of an Achromatic telescope may be purchased separately
from glass-grinders or Opticians, and tubes of a cheap material may
be prepared by the individual himself for receiving the glasses.
The following are the prices at which achromatic object-glasses for
astronomical telescopes are generally sold. Focal length 30 inches,
diameter 2-1/4 inches, from 2 to 3-1/2 guineas. Focal length 42 inches,
diameter 2-3/4 inches, from 5 to 8 guineas. Focal length 42 inches,
diameter 3-1/4 inches, from 12 to 20 guineas. Focal length 42 inches,
diameter 3-3/4 inches, from 25 to 30 guineas. Eye-pieces, from 10s. 6d.
to 18 shillings. The smallest of these lenses, namely that of 2-1/4
inches diameter, if truly achromatic, may be made to bear a power of
from 80 to 100 times, in clear weather, for celestial objects, which
will show Jupiter’s moons and belts, Saturn’s ring and other celestial
phenomena. The tubes may be made either of tin plates, _papier maché_,
or wood. Wood, however, is rather a clumsy article, and it is sometimes
liable to warp, yet excellent tubes have sometimes been made of it.
Perhaps the cheapest and most convenient of all tubes when properly
made, are those formed of paper. In forming these a wooden roller of
the proper diameter should be procured, and paper of a proper size,
along with book-binder’s paste. About three or four layers only of the
paper should be pasted at one time, and, when sufficiently dry, it
should be smoothed by rubbing it with a smooth stick or ruler; after
which another series of layers should be pasted on, and allowed to dry
as before, and so on till the tube has acquired a sufficient degree
of strength and firmness. In this way, I have, by means of a few old
Newspapers, and similar materials, formed tubes as strong as if they
had been made of wood. If several tubes be intended to slide into each
other, the smallest tube should be made first, and it will serve as a
roller for forming the tube into which it is to slide.

An achromatic object glass of a shorter focal distance, and a smaller
diameter than any of those stated above, may be fitted up as a useful
astronomical telescope, when a better instrument cannot be procured. In
the Pawn-broker’s shops in London, and other places, an old achromatic
telescope, with an object-glass 20 inches focal distance and about
1-1/2 inch diameter, may be purchased at a price varying from 15 to 20
shillings. By applying an astronomical eye-piece to such a lens, if
a good one, it may bear a power, for celestial objects, of 50 or 60
times. If two plano-convex glasses, 3/4 inch focal distance, be placed
with their convex sides near to each other, they will form an eye-piece
which will produce a power on such an object-glass, of above 50 times,
which will show Jupiter’s belts and satellites, Saturn’s ring, the
solar spots, and the mountains and cavities of the moon. I have an
object-glass of this description which belonged to an old telescope,
which cost me only 12 shillings, and with which I formerly made some
useful astronomical observations. It was afterwards used as the
telescope of a small Equatorial instrument, and, with it, I was enabled
to perceive stars of the first and second magnitude, and the planets
Venus, Jupiter, and Mars, in _the day-time_.

But, should such a glass be still beyond the reach of the astronomical
amateur, let him not altogether despair. He may purchase a single lens,
3 feet focal distance, for about a couple of shillings, and by applying
an eye-glass of 1 inch focus, which may be procured for a shilling, he
will obtain a power of 36 times, which is a higher power than Galileo
was able to apply to his best telescope; and consequently, with such an
instrument, he will be enabled to perceive all the celestial objects
which that celebrated astronomer first described, and which excited so
much wonder, at that period, in the learned world. But, whatever kind
of telescope may be used, it is essentially requisite that it be placed
on a firm stand in all celestial observations: and any common mechanic
can easily form such a stand at a trifling expence.

There is a certain optical illusion to which most persons are subject,
in the first use of telescopes, especially when applied to the
celestial bodies, on which it may not be improper to make a remark.
The illusion to which I allude is this--that they are apt to imagine,
the telescope does not magnify nearly so much as it really does. They
are apt to complain of the small appearance which Jupiter and Saturn,
for example, present when magnified 160 or 200 times. With such powers
they are apt to imagine, that these bodies do not appear so large as
the moon to the naked eye. Yet it can be proved that Jupiter, when
nearest the earth, viewed with such a power, appears about 5 times
the diameter of the full moon, and 25 times larger in surface. This
appears from the following calculation. Jupiter, when in opposition,
or nearest the Earth, presents a diameter of 47´´: the mean apparent
diameter of the moon is about 31´. Multiply the diameter of Jupiter by
the magnifying power, 200, the product is 9400´´ or 156´ or 2° 36´,
which, divided by 31´, the moon’s diameter, produces a quotient of 5,
showing that this planet with such a power appears five times larger in
diameter than the full moon to the naked eye, and consequently 25 times
larger in surface. Were a power of only 50 times applied to Jupiter,
when nearest the earth, that planet would appear somewhat larger than
the full moon. For 47´´ multiplied by 50 gives 2350´´ or 39´, which
is 8´ more than the diameter of the moon. Yet with such a power most
persons would imagine that the planet does not appear one third of the
size of the full moon.

The principal mode by which a person may be experimentally convinced
of the fallacy to which I allude is the following:--At a time when
Jupiter happens to be within a few degrees of the moon, let the planet
be viewed through the telescope with the one eye, and the magnified
image of the planet be brought into contact with the moon as seen with
the other eye--the one eye looking at the moon, and the other viewing
the magnified image of Jupiter through the telescope when brought into
apparent contact with the moon--then it will be perceived, that with
a magnifying power of 50 the image of Jupiter will completely cover
the moon as seen by the naked eye;--and with a power of 200--when the
moon is made to appear in the centre of the magnified image of the
planet--it will be seen that Jupiter forms a large and broad circle
around the moon, appearing at least 5 times greater than the diameter
of the moon. This experiment may be varied as follows: Suppose a person
to view the moon through a small telescope or opera-glass, magnifying
three times, he will be apt to imagine, at first sight, that she is not
in the least magnified, but rather somewhat diminished. But let him
bring the image as seen in the telescope in contact with the moon as
seen with the naked eye, and he will plainly perceive the magnifying
power, by the size of the image. It may be difficult in the first
instance to look, at the same time, at the magnified image and the real
object, but a few trials will render it easy.

FOOTNOTES:

[1] Those unfortunate individuals who have been confined in the darkest
dungeons have declared, that though on their first entrance, no object
could be perceived, perhaps for a day or two, yet, in the course
of time, as the pupils of their eyes expanded, they could readily
perceive mice, rats, and other animals that infested their cells, and
likewise the walls of their apartments; which shows that, even in
such situations, light is present, and produces a certain degree of
influence.

71-74, and pp. 284-292.

[5] Light of a phosphoric nature, is frequently emitted from various
putrescent animal substances which, in the ages of superstition,
served to astonish and affright the timorous. We learn from Fabricius,
an Italian, that three young men, residing at Padua, having bought a
lamb, and eaten part of it on Easter Day, 1592, several pieces of the
remainder which they kept till the following day, shone like so many
candles when they were casually viewed in the dark. The astonishment of
the whole city was excited by this phenomenon, and a part of the flesh
was sent to Fabricius, who was Professor of anatomy, to be examined by
him. He observed, that those parts which were soft to the touch and
transparent in candle-light, were the most resplendent: and also that
some pieces of kid’s flesh which had happened to have lain in contact
with them were luminous, as well as the fingers and other parts of the
bodies of those persons who touched them. Bartholin gives an account
of a similar phenomenon, which happened at Montpelier in 1641. A poor
woman had bought a piece of flesh in the market, intending to make use
of it the following day, but happening not to be able to sleep well
that night, and her bed and pantry being in the same room, she observed
so much light come from the flesh as to illuminate all the place where
it hung. We may judge of the terror and astonishment of the woman
herself, when we find that a part of this luminous flesh was carried as
a very extraordinary curiosity to Henry, Duke of Conde, the Governor of
the place, who viewed it several hours with the greatest astonishment.
The light was as if gems had been scattered over the surface, and
continued till the flesh began to putrify, when it vanished, which
it was believed to do in the form of a cross. Hence the propriety of
instructing the mass of the community in the knowledge of the facts
connected with the material system, and the physical causes of the
various phenomena of nature.

[7] By a _medium_, in optics, is meant the space in which a ray of
light moves, whether pure space, air, water, glass, diamond, or any
other transparent substance through which the rays of light can pass in
straight lines.

[8] Edinburgh Philosophical Journal for October 1819, p. 411.

[9] This mode of finding the focus of a concave lens may be varied as
follows:--let the lens be covered with paper, having two small circular
holes; and on the paper for receiving the light, describe also two
small circles, but with their centres at twice the distance from each
other of the centres of the circles. Then move the paper to and from,
till the middle of the sun’s light, coming through the holes, falls
exactly on the middle of the circles; that distance of the paper from
the lens will be the focal length required.

[10] Small glass mirrors for performing some of the experiments, and
illustrating some of the principles above alluded to,--may be made of
the flattest kind of common watch glasses, by foliating or covering
with tin leaf and quicksilver the convex surfaces of such glasses.
Their focal distances will generally be from one to two inches. Such
mirrors afford a very large and beautiful view of the eye, when held
within their focal distance of that organ. Such mirrors will also serve
the purpose of reflecting light on the objects viewed by microscopes.
Larger mirrors, of from four to eight inches diameter, may be had of
the optician at different prices varying from five to ten or fifteen
shillings.

[12] There can be little doubt that some of the facts ascribed, in the
western highlands of Scotland, to _second sight_, have been owing to
the unusual refraction of the atmosphere; as one of the peculiarities
attributed to those who possessed this faculty was, that they were
enabled to descry boats and snips, before they appeared in the horizon.

[13] Fraunhofer was in the highest sense of the word, an _Optician_,
an original discoverer in the most abstruse and delicate departments
of this science--a competent mathematician, an admirable mechanist,
and a man of a truly philosophical turn of mind. By his extraordinary
talents, he was soon raised from the lowest station in a manufacturing
establishment to the direction of the _optical_ department of the
business, in which he originally laboured as an ordinary workman.
He then applied the whole power of his mind to the perfection of
the achromatic telescope, the defects of which in reference to the
optical properties of the materials used--he attempted to remedy; and
by a series of admirable experiments, succeeded in giving to optical
determinations, the precision of astronomical observations, surpassing,
in this respect all who had gone before him, except perhaps, the
illustrious Newton. It was in the course of these researches, that he
was led to the important discovery of the dark lines which occur in the
solar spectrum. His achromatic telescopes are scattered over Europe,
and are the largest and best that have hitherto been constructed. He
died at Munich, at a premature age, in 1826; his death, it is said
being accelerated by the unwholesome nature of the processes employed
in his glass-house; leaving behind him a reputation rarely attained
by one so young. His Memoir “On the refractive and dispersive power
of different species of glass, in reference to the improvement of
Achromatic telescopes, and an account of the lines on the spectrum,”
will be found in the “Edinburgh Philosophical Journal,” Vol. ix. pp.
288-299, and Vol. x. pp. 26-40, for 1823-4.

[16] It is a question which has been frequently started--Whether there
was any rainbow before the flood? Some have conceived that the rainbow
was something of a _miraculous_ production, and that it was never
seen before the flood. The equivocal sense of the word ‘set’ in our
translation, has occasioned a mistaken impression of this kind. The
Hebrew word thus translated, signifies more properly ‘I do give,’ or
‘I _appoint_.’ The whole passage in reference to this circumstance,
literally translated, runs thus;--“I appoint my bow which is in the
cloud, that it may be for a sign or token of a covenant between me and
the earth; and it shall come to pass when I bring a cloud over the
earth, and the bow shall be seen in the cloud, that I will remember my
covenant that is between me and you,” &c. As the rainbow is produced
by the immutable laws of refraction and reflection, as applied to the
rays of the sun striking on drops of falling rain, the phenomenon must
have been occasionally exhibited from the beginning of the world:
unless we suppose that there was no rain before the flood, and that the
constitution of things in the physical system was very different from
what it is now. The passage affirms no more than that the rainbow was
_then appointed_ to be a _symbol_ of the covenant between God and man,
and although it may have been frequently seen before, it would serve
the purpose of a sign equally well, as if it had been miraculously
formed for this purpose, and even better, as its frequent appearance,
according to natural laws, is a perpetual memorial to man of the divine
faithfulness and mercy.

[17] Though Borellus mentions this circumstance, yet there is some
reason to doubt the accuracy of this statement, as young Jansen appears
to have been at that period, not more than six years old; so that it
is more probable that Galileo was the first discoverer of Jupiter’s
satellites.

[18] The reader may see an engraving of this instrument in the author’s
work entitled ‘the _Improvement of Society_.’--p. 209.

[19] It is one of the properties of concave lenses to render convergent
rays less convergent, and when placed as here supposed, to render them
parallel; and it is parallel rays that produce distinct vision.

[20] The word _aperture_ as applied to object-glasses, signifies the
opening to let in the light, or that part of the object-glass which is
left uncovered. An object-glass may be 3 inches in diameter, but if one
inch of this diameter be covered, its aperture is said to be only 2
inches.

[21] An achromatic telescope is said to be in possession of Mr. Cooper,
M.P. for Sligo, which is 26 feet long, and the diameter of the object
glass 14 inches.

[22] This telescope, which was made by Dollond, with a power of 240
times, gives a beautiful view of the belts of Jupiter and the double
ring of Saturn, and with a power of 50, the stars in the milky way and
some of the nebulæ appear very numerous and brilliant. Its owner is a
gentleman who unites science with Christianity.

experiments, the reader is referred to his Dissertation on this subject
in Vol. II. of the ‘Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh,’
which occupies 76 pages--or to Nicholson’s ‘Journal of Natural
Philosophy,’ &c. Quarto Series, Vol. I., April, September, 1797.

[24] A more detailed account of the processes connected with the
construction of this telescope, will be found in a paper presented
to the Royal Society, in 1827, and published in the Philosophical
Transactions of that Society, for 1828, and likewise another paper,
published in the Transactions for 1829. From these documents, chiefly,
the preceding account has been abridged. See also the ‘Edinburgh
New Philosophical Journal’ for Jan.,--April, 1828, and Brewster’s

for moving it, illustrated with an engraving, may be seen in Reid and
Gray’s ‘Abridgement of the Philosophical Transactions.’--Vol. vi. Part

[26] Miss Short, who has erected and who superintends an observatory
on the Calton hill, Edinburgh, is the descendant of a brother of Mr.
Short. She is in possession of a large Gregorian reflector, about 12
feet long, made by Mr. Short, and mounted on an Equatorial axis. It was
originally placed in a small observatory erected on the Calton hill,
about the year 1776, but for many years past it has been little used.

[29] In using telescopes within doors, care should generally be taken,
that there be no fires in the apartment where they are placed for
observation, and that the air within be nearly of the same temperature
as the air of the surrounding atmosphere; for if the room be filled
with heated air, when the windows are opened, there will be a current
of cold air rushing in, and of heated air rushing out, which will
produce such an undulation and tremulous motion, as will prevent any
celestial object from being distinctly seen.

[34] The distance of Saturn from the sun is 906,000,000 of miles; it
is sometimes nearer to and at other times farther from the earth,
according as it is near the point of its opposition to, or conjunction
with the sun. If this number be divided by 200, the supposed magnifying
power of the telescope, the quotient is 4,530,000, which expresses
the distance in miles at which it enables us to contemplate this
planet. If this number be subtracted from 906,000,000, the remainder
is 901,470,000, which expresses the number of miles from the earth at
which we are supposed to view Saturn with such an instrument.

[39] Or find the sun’s right ascension for the given day; substract
this from the star or planet’s right ascension, and the remainder
is the approximate time of the star’s coming to the meridian. The
difference between this time and the time of observation, will then
determine the point to which the telescope is to be directed.

[40] The right ascensions, declinations, longitudes, &c., stated in
these memoranda--which were noted at the time of observation--are only
approximations to the truth; perfect accuracy in these respects being
of no importance in such observations. They are, however, in general,
within a minute or two of the truth. The _times_ of the observations,
too, are noted in reference--not to the _astronomical_, but to the
_civil_ day. The astronomical day commences at 12 noon, and the hours
are reckoned, without interruption, to the following noon. The civil
day commences at 12 midnight.

[41] This observation is inserted in the ‘Edinburgh Philosophical
Journal’ for January, 1844.

[42] The late Mr. Benjamin Martin, when describing the nature of the
solar telescope, in his ‘_Philosophia Britannica_,’ Vol. iii. p. 85,
gives the following relation:--‘I cannot here omit to mention a very
_unusual phenomenon_ that I observed about ten years ago in my darkened
room. The window looked towards the west, and the spire of Chichester
Cathedral was before it at the distance of 50 or 60 yards. I used very
often to divert myself by observing the pleasant manner in which the
sun passed behind the spire, and was eclipsed by it for sometime; for
the image of the sun and of the spire were very large, being made by a
lens of 12 feet focal distance. And once as I observed the occultation
of the sun behind the spire, just as the disk disappeared, I saw
several small, bright, round bodies or balls running toward the sun
from the dark part of the room, even to the distance of 20 inches.
I observed their motion was a little irregular, but rectilinear,
and seemed accelerated as they approached the sun. These luminous
globules appeared also on the other side of the spire, and preceded
the sun, running out into the dark room, sometimes more, sometimes
less, together in the same manner as they followed the sun at its
occultation. They appeared to be in general one-twentieth of an inch
in diameter, and therefore, must be very large luminous globes in some
part of the heavens, whose light was extinguished by that of the sun,
so that they appeared not in open day light; but whether of the meteor
kind, or what sort of bodies they might be, I could not conjecture.’
Professor Hansteen mentions, that when employed in measuring the zenith
distances of the pole star, he observed a somewhat similar phenomenon,
which he described as ‘a luminous body which passed over the field of
the universal telescope--that its motion was neither perfectly equal
nor rectilinear, but resembled very much the unequal and somewhat
serpentine motion of an ascending rocket;’ and he concluded that it
must have been ‘a meteor’ or ‘shooting star’ descending from the higher
regions of the atmosphere.[43]

In my frequent observations on Venus, to determine the nearest
positions to the sun in which that planet could be seen, I had several
times an opportunity of witnessing similar phenomena. I was not a
little surprised, when searching for the planet, frequently to perceive
a body pass across the field of the telescope, apparently of the same
size as Venus, though sometimes larger and sometimes smaller, so that
I frequently mistook that body for the planet, till its rapid motion
undeceived me. In several instances _four_ or _five_ of these bodies
appeared to cross the field of view, sometimes in a perpendicular, and,
at other times in a horizontal direction. They appeared to be luminous
bodies, somewhat resembling the appearance of a planet when viewed in
the day-time with a moderate magnifying power. Their motion was nearly
rectilinear, but sometimes inclined to a waving or serpentine form, and
they appeared to move with considerable rapidity--the telescope being
furnished with a power of about 70 times. I was for a considerable
time at a loss what opinion to form of the nature of these bodies;
but having occasion to continue these observations almost every clear
day for nearly a twelvemonth, I had frequent opportunities of viewing
this phenomenon in different aspects; and was at length enabled to
form an opinion as to the cause of at least _some_ of the appearances
which presented themselves. In several instances, the bodies alluded
to appeared much larger than usual, and to move with a more rapid
velocity; in which case I could plainly perceive that they were nothing
else than _birds_ of different sizes, and apparently at different
distances, the convex surfaces of whose bodies, in certain positions,
strongly reflected the solar rays. In other instances, when they
appeared smaller, their true shape was undistinguishable by reason of
their motion and their distance.

Having inserted a few remarks on this subject, in No. XXV. of the
Edinburgh Philosophical Journal for July, 1825, particularly in
reference to Professor Hansteen’s opinion, that article came under the
review of M. Serres, Sub-Prefect of Embrun, in a paper inserted in the
_Annales de Chemie_, for October, 1825, entitled, ‘Notices regarding
fiery meteors seen during the day.’[44] In the discussion of this
subject, M. Serres admits that the light reflected very obliquely from
the feathers of a bird is capable of producing an effect similar to
that which I have now described; but that ‘the explanation ought not
to be _generalized_.’ He remarks, that, while observing the sun at the
repeating circle, he frequently perceived, even through the coloured
glass adapted to the eye-piece, large luminous points which traversed
the field of the telescope, and which appeared too well defined not to
admit them to be distant, and subtended too large angles to imagine
them birds. In illustration of this subject he states the following
facts. On the 7th September, 1820, after having observed for some time
the eclipse of the sun which happened on that day, he intended to take
a walk in the fields, and on crossing the town, he saw a numerous group
of individuals of every age and sex, who had their eyes fixed in the
direction of the sun. Further on, he perceived another group having
their eyes in like manner turned towards the sun. He questioned an
intelligent artist who was among them to learn the object that fixed
his attention. He replied, ‘We are looking at the stars which are
detaching themselves from the sun.’ ‘You may look yourself; that will
be the shortest way to learn the fact.’ He looked, and saw, in fact,
not stars, but balls of fire of a diameter equal to the largest stars,
which were projected in various directions from the upper hemisphere
of the sun, with an incalculable velocity, and although this velocity
of projection appeared the same in all, yet they did not all attain
the same distance. These globes were projected at unequal and pretty
short intervals. Several were often projected at once, but always
diverging from one another. Some of them described a right line, and
were extinguished in the distance; some described a parabolic line, and
were in like manner extinguished; others again, after having removed
to a certain distance in a right line, retrograded upon the same line,
and seemed to enter, still luminous, into the sun’s disk. The ground of
this magnificent picture was a sky blue, somewhat tinged with brown.
Such was his astonishment at the sight of so majestic a spectacle, that
it was impossible for him to keep his eyes off it till it ceased, which
happened gradually as the eclipse wore off and the solar rays resumed
their ordinary lustre. It was remarked by one of the crowd that ‘the
sun projected most stars at the time when it was palest;’ and that the
circumstance which first excited attention to this phenomenon was that
of a woman who cried out ‘Come here!--come and see the flames that are
issuing from the sun!’

I have stated the above facts because they may afterwards tend to throw
light upon certain objects or phenomena with which we are at present
unacquainted. The phenomenon of ‘falling stars’ has of late years
excited considerable attention, and it seems now to be admitted, that,
at least, certain species of these bodies descend from regions far
beyond the limits of our atmosphere. This may be pronounced as certain
with regard to the ‘November Meteors.’ May not some of the phenomena
described above, be connected with the fall of meteoric stones--the
showers of falling stars seen on the 12th and 13th of November, or
other meteoric phenomena whose causes we have hitherto been unable to
explain? Or, may we conceive that certain celestial bodies, with whose
nature and destination we are as yet unacquainted, may be revolving in
different courses in the regions around us--some of them opaque and
others luminous, and whose light is undistinguishable by reason of the
solar effulgence?

[47] The balls which represent the different planets, on this machine,
have their hemispheres painted black, with the white side turned
directly to the sun, so that if the eye be placed in a line with the
earth, and the planet, particularly Mercury and Venus, its phase in the
heavens, at that time, as viewed with a telescope, may be distinctly
perceived.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

                              *CHAPTER I*

                            *"THE FLITTIN’"*

    "When lo there came a rumour,
      A whispering to me
    Of the grey town, the fey town,
      The town where I would be."
        FRANCIS BRETT BRETT-SMITH.


The village was thunderstruck.  Nay, more; the village was disapproving,
almost scandalised.

It was astounded to the verge of incredulity when it heard that a man
who had lived in its midst quietly and peaceably for five-and-twenty
years was suddenly, and without any due warning whatsoever, going to
remove to the south of England not only himself, but the entire
household effects of a dwelling that had never belonged to him.

It is true that the minister pointed out to certain of these adverse
critics that by her will Miss Esperance had left both house and
furniture to Mr. Wycherly in trust for her great-nephews; but people
shook their heads: "Once the bit things were awa’ to Oxford wha’ kenned
what he’d dae wi’ them?"

Such conscientious objectors mistrusted Oxford, and they deeply
distrusted the motives that led Mr. Wycherly to go there in little more
than a month after the death of his true and tried old friend.

That it was a return only made matters worse, and the postman, who was
also one of the church elders, summed up the feelings of the community
in the ominous words: "He has gone back to the husks."

Even Lady Alicia, who liked and trusted Mr. Wycherly, thought it was odd
of him to depart so soon, and that it would have been better to have the
boys up to Scotland for their Easter holidays.

What nobody realised was that poor Mr. Wycherly felt his loss so
poignantly, missed the familiar, beneficent presence so cruelly, that he
dreaded a like experience for the boys he loved.  The "wee hoose" in the
time of its mistress had always been an abode of ordered cheerfulness,
and Mr. Wycherly wanted that memory and no other to abide in the minds
of the two boys.

It was all very well to point out to remonstrating neighbours that March
and not May is "the term" in England; that he was not moving till April,
and that the time would just coincide with their holidays and thus save
Edmund and Montagu the very long journey to Burnhead.  Neither of these
were the real reasons.

The "wee hoose" had become intolerable to him.  Hour by hour he found
himself waiting, ever listening intently for the light, loved footstep;
for the faint rustle that accompanies gracious, gentle movements; for
the sound of a kind and welcoming old voice.  And there came no comfort
to Mr. Wycherly, till one day in a letter from Montagu at Winchester he
found these words: "I suppose now you will go back to Oxford.  Mr. Holt
thinks you ought, and I’m sure Aunt Esperance would like it.  She always
said she hoped you would go back when she wasn’t there any more.  It
must be dreadfully lonely now at Remote, and it would be easier for us
in the holidays."

"I suppose now you will go back to Oxford."  All that day the sentence
rang in Mr. Wycherly’s head.  That night for the first time since her
death he slept well.  He dreamed that he walked with Miss Esperance in
the garden of New College beside the ancient city wall, and that she
looked up at him, smiling, and said, "It is indeed good to be here."

Next day, as Robina, the servant, put it, "he took the train," and four
days later returned to announce that he had rented a house in Oxford and
was going there almost at once.

                     *      *      *      *      *

If Mr. Wycherly’s sudden move was made chiefly with the hope of sparing
the boys sadness and sense of bereavement in this, their first holidays
without their aunt, that hope was abundantly fulfilled.

It was a most delightful house: an old, old house in Holywell with three
gables resting on an oaken beam which, in its turn, was supported by oak
corbels in the form of dragons and a rotund, festive-looking demon who
nevertheless clasped his hands over "the place where the doll’s wax
ends" as though he had a pain.

Two of the gables possessed large latticed windows, but the third was
blank, having, however, a tiny window at the side which looked down the
street towards New College.

At the back was a long crooked garden that widened out like a tennis
racquet at the far end.

It was all very delightful and exciting while the furniture was going in
and the three stayed at the King’s Arms at the corner.

Edmund and Montagu between them took it upon themselves to settle the
whereabouts of the furniture and drove the removal men nearly distracted
by suggesting at least six positions for each thing as it was carried
in.  But finally Mr. Wycherly was bound to confess that there was a
certain method in their apparent madness. For as the rooms in Holywell
filled up, he found that, allowing for difference in their dimensions
and, above all, their irregularity of shape, every big piece of
furniture was placed in relation to the rest exactly as it had been in
the small, square rooms at Remote.

Boys are very conservative, and in nothing more so than in their
attachment to the familiar.  They pestered and worried that most patient
foreman till each room contained exactly the same furniture, no more and
no less, that had, as Edmund put it, "lived together" in their aunt’s
house.

Then appeared a cloud on the horizon.  Lady Alicia, who loved arranging
things for people, had very kindly written to a friend of her own at
Abingdon, and through her had engaged "a thoroughly capable woman" to
"do for" Mr. Wycherly in Oxford.

"She can get a young girl to help her if she finds it too much after
you’re settled, but you ought to try and do with one at first; for a
move, and such a move—why couldn’t you go into Edinburgh if you want
society?—will about ruin you.  And, remember, no English servant
washes."

"Oh, Lady Alicia, I’m sure you are mistaken there," Mr. Wycherly
exclaimed, indignant at this supposed slur on his country-women. "I’m
sure they look even cleaner and neater than the Scotch."

"Bless the man!  I’m not talking of themselves—I mean they won’t do the
washing, the clothes and sheets and things; you’ll have to put it out or
have someone in to do it.  Is there a green?"

"There is a lawn," Mr. Wycherly said, dubiously—"it’s rather a pleasant
garden."

"Is there a copper?"

"I beg your pardon?" replied the bewildered Mr. Wycherly, thinking this
must be some "appurtenance" to a garden of which he was ignorant.

"There, you see, there are probably hundreds of things missing in that
house that ought to be in it.  You’d better put out the washing."

Mr. Wycherly felt and looked distinctly relieved.  The smell of wet
soapsuds that had always pervaded Remote on Monday mornings did not
appeal to him.

And now, when all the furniture was in its place and the carpets laid;
when the china and pots and pans had been unpacked by the removal men
and laid upon shelves; when the beds had been set up and only awaited
their customary coverings; on the very day that the "thoroughly capable
woman" was to come and take possession of it all, there came a letter
from her instead to the effect that "her mother was took bad suddint,"
and she couldn’t leave home.  Nor did she suggest any date in the near
future when she would be at liberty to come.  Moreover, she concluded
this desolating intelligence with the remark, "after having thinking it
over I should prefer to go where there’s a missus, so I hopes you’ll
arrange according."

Here was a knock-down blow!

They found the letter in the box at the new house when they rushed there
directly after breakfast to gloat over their possessions.

The wooden shutters were shut in the two downstairs sitting-rooms; three
people formed a congested crowd in the tiny shallow entrance, even when
one of the three was but ten years old.  So they went through the
parlour and climbed a steep and winding staircase to one of the two
large front bedrooms.  There, in the bright sunlight of an April
morning, Mr. Wycherly read aloud this perturbing missive.

"Bother the woman’s mother," cried Edmund who was not of a sympathetic
disposition. "Let’s do without one altogether, Guardie.  We could
pretend we’re the Swiss Family Robinson and have awful fun."

"I fear," said Mr. Wycherly sadly, "that I, personally, do not possess
the ingenuity of the excellent father of that most resourceful family."

"Shall I telegraph to Lady Alicia?" asked Montagu, who had lately
discovered the joys of the telegraph office.  "She could poke up that
friend of hers in Abingdon to find us an orphan."

"No!" replied Mr. Wycherly with decision. "We won’t do that.  We must
manage our own affairs as best we can and not pester our friends with
our misfortunes."

"How does one get servants?" asked Montagu.

Nobody answered.  Even Edmund for once was at a loss.  None of the three
had ever heard the servant question discussed.  Old Elsa had lived with
Miss Esperance from girlhood; dying as she had lived in the service of
her beloved mistress.  Robina had come when the little boys were added
to the household and remained till Mr. Wycherly left for Oxford, when
she at last consented to marry "Sandie the Flesher," who had courted her
for nine long years.

Mr. Wycherly sat down on a chair beside his bed immersed in thought.
Montagu perched on the rail at the end of the bed and surveyed the
street from this eminence.  As there were neither curtains nor blinds in
the window his view was unimpeded.  Edmund walked about the room on his
hands till he encountered a tin-tack that the men had left, then he sat
on the floor noisily sucking the wounded member.

It seemed that his gymnastic exercises had been mentally stimulating,
for he took his hand out of his mouth to remark:

"What’s ’A High-class Registry Office for servants’?"

Mr. Wycherly turned to him in some excitement.

"I suppose a place where they keep the names of the disengaged upon
their books to meet the needs of those who seek servants.  Why?  Have
you seen one?"

Edmund nodded.  "Yesterday, in yon street where you went to the
bookseller.  It was about three doors up, a dingy window with a wire
blind and lots of wee cards with ’respectable’ coming over and over
again.  They were all ’respectable’ whether they were ten pounds or
twenty-four.  I read them while I was waiting for you."

"Dear me, Edmund," exclaimed Mr. Wycherly admiringly, "what an observant
boy you are.  I’ll go there at once and make inquiries. In the meantime
I daresay we could get a charwoman to come in and make up the beds for
us, and so move in to-morrow as arranged.  They can’t all be very busy
yet as the men have not come up."

"But there’s only three beds," Edmund objected; "she can’t make them all
day."

"She can do other things, doubtless," said Mr. Wycherly optimistically;
"she’ll need to cook for us and," with a wave of the hand, "dust, you
know, and perhaps assist us to unpack some of those cases that are as
yet untouched. There are many ways in which she could be most useful."

"I’d rather have Swissed it," Edmund murmured sorrowfully.

"Shall we come with you?" asked Montagu, who had an undefined feeling
that his guardian ought not to be left to do things alone.

"No," said Mr. Wycherly, rising hastily. "You might, if you would be so
good, find the boxes that contain blankets and sheets and begin
unpacking them.  I’ll go to that office at once."

He hurried away, walking fast through the sunny streets, so strange and
yet so familiar, till he came to the window with the wire blind that
Edmund had indicated.  Here he paused, fixed his eyeglasses firmly on
his nose and read the cards exhibited.  Alas! they nearly all referred
to the needs of the servantless, and only two emanated from handmaidens
desirous of obtaining situations.  Of these, one was a nursemaid, and
the other "as tweeny," a species unknown to Mr. Wycherly, and as her age
was only fourteen he did not allow his mind to dwell upon her
possibilities.

He opened the door and an automatic bell rang loudly.  He shut the door,
when it rang again, greatly to his distress.  He seemed to be making so
much noise.

The apartment was sparsely furnished with a largish table covered with
rather tired-looking ledgers; two cane chairs stood in front of the
table, while behind it was a larger leather-covered chair on which was
seated a stout, formidable woman, who glared rather than looked at Mr.
Wycherly as he approached.

She really was of great bulk, with several chins and what dressmakers
would call "a fine bust."  Her garments were apparently extremely tight,
for her every movement was attended by an ominous creaking.  Her hair
was frizzed in front right down to her light eyebrows; at the back it
was braided in tight plaits.  She regarded Mr. Wycherly with small,
hostile eyes.

He had removed his hat on entrance, and stood before her with dignified
white head bowed in deference towards her, courteously murmuring, "Good
morning."

As she did not make any response, he continued, "I am in need of a
competent cook-housekeeper, and thought perhaps——"

"How many servants kep’?" she demanded with a fire and suddenness that
startled Mr. Wycherly.

"I had thought of trying to do with one."

"’Ow many in fambly?" and this alarming woman opened one of the books in
front of her and seized a pen.  There was in her tone such a dreadful
suggestion of, "Anything you may say will be used against you," that
when she dipped her pen into the ink Mr. Wycherly positively trembled;
and grasped the back of one of the cane chairs as a support.

"For the larger portion of the year I shall be alone," he said rather
sadly, "but during the holidays my two wards——"

"Male or female?"

"Really," Mr. Wycherly remonstrated, "what has that got to do with it?
As a matter of fact my wards are boys."

All this time she had been making entries in the ledger; now she looked
up to fire off, abruptly as before:

"The booking fee is one-and-six."

Mr. Wycherly took a handful of silver out of his pocket and abstracted
this sum and laid it upon the desk.  She of the ledger ignored the
offering and continued her cross-examination:

"What wages?"

Mr. Wycherly mentally invoked a blessing upon Lady Alicia’s practical
head as he replied quite glibly, "From twenty to twenty-five pounds, but
she must be trustworthy and capable."

"What outings?"

Here was a poser!  But the fighting spirit had been roused in Mr.
Wycherly.  He would not be browbeaten by this stout, ungracious person
who took his eighteenpence, and so far had done nothing but ask
questions, affording him no information whatsoever.

"That," he retorted with dignity, "can be arranged later on."

"Your name and address?" was the next query, and when he furnished this
information, carefully spelling his name, it pained him inexpressibly to
note that she wrote it down as "Witcherby," at the same time remarking
in a rumbling tone indicative of displeasure, "Very old ’ouses, most
inconvenient, most trying stairs....  ’Ow soon do you want a general?"

"A what?" asked Mr. Wycherly, this time thoroughly mystified.

"A general, that’s what she is if there’s no more kep’.  You won’t get
no cook-’ousekeeper unless she’s to ’ave ’er meals along with you, and a
little girl to do the rough work."

"She can’t possibly have her meals with me," cried Mr. Wycherly, crimson
at the very thought. "It would be most unpleasant—for both of us."

"Then as I said it’s a general you wants."

"And have you upon your books any staid and respectable young
woman—preferably an orphan—"  Mr. Wycherly interpolated, remembering
Montagu’s suggestion, "who could come to us at once?"

"Not, so to speak, to-day, I ’aven’t; but they often comes in of a
Monday, and I’ll let you know.  I could send ’er along; it isn’t far."

The ledger was shut with a bang as an intimation that the interview was
at an end, and Mr. Wycherly fared forth into the street with heated brow
and a sense that, in spite of his heroism in braving so dreadful a
person, he was not much further on his quest.  "Monday, she said," he
kept repeating to himself, "and to-day is only Thursday."

When he got back to Holywell, the boys were standing at the front door
on the lookout for him.  They rushed towards him exclaiming in delighted
chorus: "We’ve got a woman.  We thought we’d ask at the King’s Arms, and
they told us of one."

"What?  A servant?" asked Mr. Wycherly with incredulous joy.

"No, no, a day-body.  The boots knew about her; she lives down Hell
Lane, just about opposite."

"Edmund!" Mr. Wycherly remonstrated. "However did you get hold of that
name?"

"Hoots!" replied Edmund.  "Everyone calls it that.  Her name is Griffin,
and she’s coming at once.  Have _you_ got one?"

"No," said Mr. Wycherly, "not yet.  Boys, it’s a most bewildering
search.  Can either of you tell me since when maid-servants have taken
to call themselves after officers in the army?  The rather alarming
person in charge of that office informs me that what we require is a
’general.’  Do you suppose that if we should need a younger maid to help
her we must ask for a ’sub-lieutenant’?"

"Perhaps they are called generals when they’re old," said Montagu
thoughtfully; "at that rate we ought to call Mrs. Griffin a
field-marshal.  She’s pretty old, I can tell you, but she’s most
agreeable."

"Probably," said Mr. Wycherly, "in time to come they will get tired of
the army and take to the nomenclature of the Universities.  Then we
shall have provosts and deans and wardens. But I’m glad that you have
been more successful than I have.  I’ve no doubt we can manage with Mrs.
Griffin until we get a maid of our own."

"I think it was mean of that body with the mother," said Edmund; "she
didn’t even say she’d come as soon as she could.  But I think the
Griffin will be fun, and if she can’t do it all we’ll get the
Mock-Turtle to help her."

"Was it very high-class, that registry?" he continued; "it didn’t look
at all grand outside."

"I cannot judge of its class, I have never been to such a place before
and I earnestly hope I may never be called upon to go there again, for
it is a species of inquisition, and they write your answers down in a
book.  A horrid experience."  And Mr. Wycherly shuddered.

By this time they had reached the house and he was sitting, exhausted,
in his arm-chair in his own dining-room.  The boys had opened the
shutters and casement, and in spite of a thick coating of dust
everywhere it looked home-like and comfortable.

"_Richly_ built, never pinchingly" is as true of ancient Oxford houses
as of her colleges.  There seemed some mysterious affinity between the
queer old furniture from Remote and that infinitely older room.  The
horse-hair sofa with the bandy legs and slippery seat that stood athwart
the fireless hearth was in no way discordant with the beautiful stone
fireplace and shallow mantelshelf.

Mr. Wycherly surveyed the scene with kind, pleased eyes; nor did he
realise then that what made it all seem so endearing and familiar was
the fact that on the horse-hair sofa there sprawled—"sat" is far too
decorous a word—a lively boy of ten, with rumpled, curly, yellow hair
and a rosy handsome face from which frank blue eyes looked forth upon a
world that, so far, contained little that he did not consider in the
light of an adventure.

While balanced on the edge of the table—again "sat" is quite
undescriptive—another boy swung his long legs while his hands were
plunged deep in his trouser pockets.  A tall, thin boy this, with grave
dark eyes, long-lashed and gentle, and a scholar’s forehead.

Montagu, nearly fourteen, had just reached the age when clothes seem
always rather small, sleeves short, likewise trousers: when wrists are
red and obtrusive and hair at the crown of the head stands straight on
end.

Neither of the boys ever sat still except when reading.  Then Montagu,
at all events, was lost to the world.  They frequently talked loudly and
at the same time, and were noisy, gay and restless as is the usual habit
of their healthy kind.

Strange companions truly for a scholarly recluse!  Yet the boys were
absolutely at ease with and fearless of their guardian.

With him they were even more artlessly natural than with schoolfellows
of their own age. Their affection for him was literally a part of their
characters, and, in Montagu’s case, passionately protective.  The elder
boy had already realised how singularly unfitted Mr. Wycherly was, both
by temperament and habit, to grapple with practical difficulties.

"Ah’m awfu’ hungry," said Edmund presently, in broadest Doric.

"Edmund," remarked his guardian, "I have noticed on several occasions
since you returned from school that you persist in talking exactly like
the peasantry at Burnhead.  Why?"

"Well, you see, Guardie, for one thing I’m afraid of forgetting it.  And
then, you know, it amuses the chaps.  _They_ admire it very much."

"But you never did it in Scotland," Mr. Wycherly expostulated.

"Oh, didn’t I.  Not to you and Aunt Esperance, perhaps, but you should
have heard me when I got outside——

"I don’t like it, Edmund, and I wonder your masters have not found fault
with you."

"They think I can’t help it, and it makes them laugh—you should hear me
say my collect exactly like Sandie Croall——"

"Indeed I wish to hear nothing of the kind," said Mr. Wycherly in
dignified reproof.  "I can’t think why you should copy the lower classes
in your mode of speech."

"I’m a Bethune," Edmund replied in an offended voice.  "I _want_ people
to know I’m a Scot."

"Your name is quite enough to make them sure of that," Mr. Wycherly
argued, "and you may take it from me that Scottish gentlemen don’t talk
in the least like Sandie Croall."

At that particular moment Edmund was busily engaged in doing a
handspring on the end of the sofa, so he forebore to reply.  The fact
was, that like the immortal "Christina McNab" Edmund had, early in his
career at school, decided that to be merely "Scotch" was ordinary and
uninteresting, but to be "d—d Scotch" was both distinguished and
amusing, and he speedily attained to popularity and even a certain
eminence among his schoolfellows when he persisted in answering every
question with a broadness of vowel and welter of "r’s" characteristic of
those whom Mr. Wycherly called "the peasantry of Burnhead."  Moreover,
he used many homely and expressive adjectives that were seized upon by
his companions as a new and sonorous form of slang.  Altogether Edmund
was a social success in the school world. His report was not quite
equally enthusiastic, but, as he philosophically remarked to Montagu,
"It would be monotonous for Guardie if we both had good reports, and
your’s makes you out to be a fearful smug."

Whereupon Montagu suitably chastised his younger brother with a slipper,
and the subject was held over to the next debate.

Presently there came a meek little tinkle from the side-door bell.

"That’ll be the Griffin," cried Edmund joyfully; "I’ll open to her."

It _was_ the Griffin, and their troubles began in earnest.




                              *CHAPTER II*

                          *THE HOUSE OPPOSITE*

    "Still on the spire the pigeons flutter;
      Still by the gateway flits the gown;
    Still on the street, from corbel and gutter,
      Faces of stone look down.

    Faces of stone, and other faces...."
        A. T. QUILLER-COUCH.


Mrs. Griffin was not in the least like her name.  She was a sidling,
snuffling, apologetic little woman, who, whenever a suggestion was made,
always acquiesced with breathless enthusiasm, gasping: "Yessir;
suttingly sir; _any_think you please sir."

That night they dined at the comfortable King’s Arms for the last time
and moved in after breakfast on the morrow.  Mrs. Griffin did not shine
as a cook.  Their first meal consisted of burnt chops, black outside and
of an angry purple within, watery potatoes and a stony cauliflower.
This was followed by a substantial apple dumpling whose paste strongly
resembled caramels in its consistency, while the apples within were
quite hard.  Even the lumpy white sauce that tasted chiefly of raw
flour, hardly made this an appetising dish.

She had, it is true, by Mr. Wycherly’s order, lit fires in all four
front rooms.  The bedrooms were over the two living-rooms, and, like
them, were wainscotted, irregular in shape, and fairly large, light and
well-proportioned, each with wide casement window.  Except the study,
every room in the house had at least two doors, and between the two
front bedrooms there was yet another, in a delightful, passage-like
recess. In Mr. Wycherly’s study, which was on the first floor at the
back—with a high oriel window that looked forth on the garden—no fire
had been put as yet, for his books were not unpacked but stood in great
wooden cases, stacked against the wall, one on the top of the other,
three deep. Wisps of straw and pieces of paper still lay about; and
where his books were concerned Mr. Wycherly was quite practical.

During the day Mrs. Griffin, as she put it, "swep’ up the bits" in the
other rooms (Mr. Wycherly locked the study and carried the key), and
volunteered to go out and "get in some stores" for the morrow.  This
offer he gratefully accepted, entrusting her with a couple of sovereigns
to that end.  It took her the whole afternoon, and she seemed to have
patronised a variety of shops, for Mr. Wycherly, who remained in the
house to look after it, was kept busy answering the side door and
receiving parcels.

He had sent the boys to explore Oxford. They found the river and didn’t
get back till tea-time, a meal where the chief characteristics consisted
of black and bitter tea and curiously bad butter.

They supped on tinned tongue and dry bread, and even the boys were glad
to go to bed early in their grand new room.

The night before Mr. Wycherly left for England the minister came to see
him.  At first they talked of the move; of Oxford; of the great change
it would make in the lives of the three most concerned.  Then it was
borne in upon Mr. Wycherly that Mr. Gloag was there for some special
purpose and found it difficult to come to the point.

At last he did so; cleared his throat, looked hard at his host, and then
said gravely: "I hope you fully realise, that in undertaking the sole
guardianship of those two boys you must carry on the excellent religious
training given them by Miss Esperance.  There must be no break, no
spiritual backwardness...."

"I assure you," Mr. Wycherly interposed, "that there is no lack of
religious training in our English schools; it forms a large part...."

"That’s as it may be," the minister interrupted. "It’s the home
religious training to which I referred, and it is that counts most in
after life.  For instance, now, did not Miss Esperance daily read the
Bible with those boys when they were with her?"

"I believe she did," Mr. Wycherly replied meekly.

"Well, then, what is to prevent you from doing the same and so carrying
on her work?"

"I will do my best."

"Remember," said the minister, "we are bidden to search the scriptures,
and the young are not, as a rule, much given to doing it of their own
accord."

"That is true," Mr. Wycherly agreed, wishing from his heart that they
were, for then he would not be required to interfere.

"Then I may depend upon you?" asked the minister.

"As I said before, I will do my best," said Mr. Wycherly, but he gave no
promise.

And now as he sat in his dusty dining-room—Mrs. Griffin’s ministrations
were confined to "the bits" and did not extend to the furniture—on this,
the first evening in their new home, he heard the scampering feet over
his head as the boys got ready for bed, and the minister’s words came
back to him.  "He’s right," he thought to himself, "it’s what she would
have wished," and spent as he was he went upstairs.

Their room was in terrible confusion, for both had begun to unpack, and
got tired of it.  Thus, garments were scattered on every chair and most
of the floor.  There were plenty of places to put things; all the deep
old "presses" and wardrobes had come from Remote, and the house abounded
in splendid cupboards; but so far nobody ever put anything away, and Mr.
Wycherly wondered painfully how it was that Remote had always been such
an orderly house.

He sat down on Edmund’s bed.  "Boys," he said, "you used always to read
with Miss Esperance, didn’t you?"

"Yes, Guardie," Montagu answered; then, instantly understanding, he
added gently: "Would you like us to do it with you?"

"I should," said Mr. Wycherly gratefully; "we’ll each read part of the
Bible every day, and I’d like to begin now.  Can you find your Bibles?"

This entailed much searching and more strewing of garments, but finally
the school Bibles were unearthed.

"Let’s begin at the very beginning," Edmund suggested, "then it’ll take
us years and years only doing it in the holidays."

"Oh, but we’ll read a good bit at a time," said Montagu, who disliked
niggardly methods where books were concerned.  "It won’t take so long
really."

"Well, anyway, Guardie, we can miss the ’begats,’ can’t we?  and the
’did evils in the sight,’" Edmund said beseechingly.

"We’ll see when we come to them," Mr. Wycherly answered.  "Who will
begin?"

Edmund elected to begin, and read Chapter I. of Genesis.

Montagu read Chapter II. and Mr. Wycherly Chapter III.; but he got
interested and went on to Chapter IV.  He had just reached the verse,
"_And Cain talked with Abel, his brother: and it came to pass when they
were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel, his brother, and slew
him,_" when the book was pulled down gently by a small and grubby hand,
"Thank you, Guardie, dear," Edmund said sweetly, "I don’t want to tire
you, and you know we never did more than _one_ chapter with Aunt
Esperance. One between the three of us!"

"I always sympathise with Cain," Montagu remarked thoughtfully.  "I’m
perfectly certain Abel was an instructive fellow, always telling him if
he’d only do things some other way how much better it would be.  Younger
brothers are like that," he added pointedly, looking at Edmund.

"That view of the case never struck me," said Mr. Wycherly.

"It always strikes me every time I hear it," Montagu said bitterly.
"It’s just what Edmund does.  He makes me feel awfully Cainish
sometimes, I can tell you; always telling me I ought to hold a bat this
way, or I’d jump further if I took off that way, or something."

"Well, you’re such an old foozle," cried Edmund with perfect good
nature.  "So slow."

"I do things differently from you, but I do most of ’em every bit as
well."

"So you ought, you’re so much older."

"All the more reason for you to shut up."

The conversation threatened to become acrimonious, so Mr. Wycherly
intervened by asking mildly: "Is there anything either of you would like
me to explain?"

"Oh, dear, no," Edmund exclaimed heartily. "Not till we come to
Revelations.  Then it’s all explanation.  It takes Mr. Gloag an hour to
explain one wee verse, so I fear we’ll only be able to do about a word
at a time."

"But you must not expect me," Mr. Wycherly cried in dismay, "to be able
to explain things as fully as Mr. Gloag, who is a trained theologian."

"We shouldn’t _like_ you to be as long as Mr. Gloag, Guardie dear; we
shouldn’t like it at all," Montagu answered reassuringly.

Whereupon, much relieved, Mr. Wycherly bade his wards good-night, and
departed downstairs again where he sat for some considerable time
pondering Montagu’s view of the first fratricide.  "It seems to me," he
said to himself, "that it is I who will be the one to receive
enlightenment."


It was three days since they had, as Mr. Wycherly put it, "come into
residence," and during that time Mrs. Griffin’s cooking had not
improved.  Neither had the house become less dusty or more tidy.  The
time was afternoon, about five o’clock, and they sat at tea; a
singularly unappetising tea.

Smeary silver, cups and plates all bearing the impress of Mrs. Griffin’s
thumb, two plates of thick bread-and-butter and a tin of bloater-paste
were placed upon a dirty tablecloth. Neither Mr. Wycherly nor the boys
liked bloater-paste, but Mrs. Griffin did.  Hence it graced the feast.

Edmund was tired of bad meals.  The novelty, what he at first called the
"Swissishness," was wearing off, and as he took his place at table that
afternoon there flashed into his mind a vivid picture of the tea-table
at Remote. Aunt Esperance sitting kind and smiling behind the brilliant
silver teapot that reflected such funny-looking little boys; the white,
white napery—Aunt Esperance was so particular about tablecloths—laden
with scones, such good scones, both plain and currant!  Shortbread in a
silver cake-basket; and jam, crystal dishes full of jam, two kinds,
topaz-coloured and ruby.

Somehow the sight of that horrid tin of bloater-paste evoked a
poignantly beatific vision of the jam.  It was the jam broke Edmund
down.

He gave a dry sob, laid his arms on the table and his head on his arms,
wailing: "Oh, dear! oh, dear!  I wish Aunt Esperance hadn’t gone and
died."

Mr. Wycherly started up, looking painfully distressed.  Montagu ran
round to his little brother and put his arm round his shoulder—at the
same time he murmured to his guardian: "It’s the butter, it really is
very bad."

"It’s all bad," lamented Edmund; "we shall starve, all of us, if it goes
on.  One morning that bed-making body will come in and she’ll find three
skeletons.  I know she will."

Mr. Wycherly sat down again.  "Edmund, my dear little boy," he said
brokenly, "I am so sorry, I ought not to have brought you here yet...."

"Look, look at poor Guardie," whispered Montagu.

Edmund raised his head.

"Would you like me to telegraph to Lady Alicia and ask her to have you
for the rest of the holidays?  I know she would, and by-and-bye, surely,
by-and-bye we shall find some one less incompetent than that—than Mrs.
Griffin."

Edmund shook himself free of his brother’s arm and literally flung
himself upon his guardian, exclaiming vehemently: "No, no, I want to
stay with you.  It’s just as bad for you."

It was worse, for Mr. Wycherly could not restore exhausted nature with
liberal supplies of Banbury cakes and buns.  For the last three days he
had eaten hardly anything and was, moreover, seriously concerned that
the boys were assuredly not getting proper food.  He would have gone
back with them to the King’s Arms immediately he discovered how
extremely limited were Mrs. Griffin’s powers had it not been that just
then he received the furniture removers’ bill, and, as Lady Alicia had
warned him, it was very heavy.

He had come in to tea with a sore heart that afternoon, for Mrs. Griffin
had half an hour before informed him that she could not come on the
morrow; so that now even her poor help would be lost to them.  She was
going, she said, to her "sister-in-law" at Abingdon for Sunday, as she
needed a rest.

"So much cookin’ and cleanin’ is what I ain’t used to; no, not if it was
ever so; and I can’t keep on with it for long at a stretch.  I’ll come
on Monday just to oblige you if so be as I’m up to it."

"I wish you had told me this sooner," Mr. Wycherly remonstrated, "then
perhaps I might have been able to obtain help for to-morrow elsewhere."

But what they were to do on the morrow was no concern of Mrs. Griffin’s.
It was an easy and lucrative place and she wanted no interlopers. But
she also wanted her outing to Abingdon, and she was going.

Mr. Wycherly poured out the black tea and Edmund attacked a piece of
bread-and-butter.

The red rep curtains from the dining-room at Remote were hung in the
dining-room at Oxford, but they in no way shrouded its inmates from the
public gaze except when they were drawn at night.  The house stood right
on the pavement; even a small child could see in, and a good many
availed themselves of the privilege.

Over this room was the boys’ bedroom.  Here there were no "fixtures" on
which to suspend curtains, nor did it strike either of the three most
concerned that blinds or curtains were an immediate necessity.  They had
all lived in a house that stood so far from other houses (as its name
signified) that such a contingency as prying neighbours never occurred
to them and it never entered their heads to concern themselves with
those on the other side of the road.

Presently Mrs. Griffin brought in a note held gingerly between her
finger and thumb, remarking that it was from the "lady as lives
hopposite."

Mr. Wycherly opened it hastily, found he had mislaid his glasses, and
handed it to Montagu to read.

Edmund immediately rushed round to assist Montagu, thinking it was
probably an invitation, and Edmund liked invitations.

Montagu read it slowly and impressively as follows:—


"DEAR SIR,

"I think it only right to inform you that I can see the young gentlemen
performing their ablutions and dressing and undressing both when the
light is on and in the morning.  Such publicity is most distressing, and
I venture to suggest that blinds or curtains should be affixed in their
room without delay.

"Yours faithfully,
       "SELINA BROOKS."


Mr. Wycherly sank back in his chair with a groan.  "I quite forgot
curtains and blinds," he exclaimed in bitter self-reproach.  "There are
none in my room either; do you suppose the people in the next house can
see _me_?"

"Sure to!" cried Edmund gleefully; "they’ll be writing next that they
can see an _old_ gentleman ’paforming his ablutions’; but I can’t see
how they do for we all wash in the bath-room, and that’s at the back.  I
suppose they see us washing our teeth and you shaving.  I wonder if
that’s more depressing or they don’t mind so much?"

"But what can we do?" Mr. Wycherly exclaimed despairingly.  "It is
already Saturday evening and we ought to have blinds or something now,
to-night.  How do they fix blinds, by the way?"

Montagu went and stood at the window and gloomily surveyed the houses
opposite.

"You can’t see a thing in her house," he said sadly.  "There’s white
curtains with frills downstairs and a straight thing right across the
windows upstairs, and a looking-glass in one window shows just above the
straight thing. You’ve got that, you know, for shaving; we might put
ours there too; it would fill up a bit. It’s against the wall just now
because we liked to see out."

"Oh! they’d just peek round it," said Edmund. "We’d best nail a sheet
across for to-night."

"But won’t that look funny from outside?" Montagu objected.

"Not half so funny as us skipping about with nothing on," Edmund
retorted.

Mr. Wycherly sat, his elbows on the table, his head in his hands: "Boys,
boys, it is appalling that at the very outset we should have scandalised
a neighbour and made ourselves a nuisance."

"Not a nuisance, Guardie," Edmund remonstrated; "she must have _liked_
to watch us or she wouldn’t have done it.  If Mrs. Thingummy had kept
behind her own curtains she couldn’t have seen us so plain."

Here Mrs. Griffin tapped at the door again, opened it about three
inches, and called through: "A lady to see you, sir."

"That’ll be your one come to complain," Edmund whispered to his
distracted guardian.

"Am I interrupting you?  May I come in?" asked an exceedingly pleasant
voice which was followed by a kind-looking, pretty young lady, who was
rather surprised at her reception.

What she saw was a handsome, white-haired old gentleman seated at a
table with his back to the light.  Ranged on either side of him were two
boys who regarded her with looks of dark suspicion, and on the faces of
all three dismay and consternation were writ large, while Edmund’s face
was both tear-stained and exceedingly dirty.

Mr. Wycherly rose hastily as she came in.

Pretty Mrs. Methuen, wife of one of the youngest dons in Oxford, was
quite unused to manifestations other than those of pleasure at her
approach, and she stopped abruptly just inside the door to remark rather
incoherently:

"Perhaps it is too soon; it may be inconvenient, but my husband asked me
to call directly you arrived to see if I could be of any use....  He is
still fishing in Hampshire, and as I passed I saw that you were here."

Mr. Wycherly let go of the table, which he had seized nervously, and
advanced to shake her outstretched hand.  Montagu pulled out a chair for
her.

"Pray be seated," said Mr. Wycherly.  "It is most kind of you to
call....  These are my wards."

The lady took the proffered chair and shook hands with the boys, who
still looked dubious, although Edmund was distinctly attracted.

On Mr. Wycherly’s gentle, scholarly face bewilderment struggled to break
through the mask of polite interest through which he regarded his
visitor.

"You’ve only just come, haven’t you?" she asked.

"We’ve been living in the house for three days, but we are far from
being properly established; our servant has not arrived yet...."

"And we keep on finding out things we haven’t got," Edmund interpolated.

"We hope to be a little more settled before term begins," Mr. Wycherly
continued, ignoring Edmund.

"Have you been able to get everything you want?" asked the lady.
"Should you need any information about the best shops ... or the people
who do things ..."

"Ask about blinds!" whispered the irrepressible Edmund.

"You are most kind," Mr. Wycherly began, again ignoring his younger
ward, "but..."

"Mr. Wycherly," the lady said suddenly, "I don’t believe you have a
ghost of an idea who I am.  Did the woman not announce me?  My husband
is Westall Methuen, son of your old friend, and my father-in-law wrote
saying that I was to be sure and call directly you arrived in case I
could be of any use."

"I am ashamed to say," replied Mr. Wycherly, in tones full of courteous
apology, "that if Mrs. Griffin did announce your name I did not catch
it.  I assure you..."

"She never said any name, just ’a lady,’" Edmund again interrupted, "and
we thought you must be _her_."

"Were you expecting somebody dreadful that you all looked so horrified
when I walked in?" asked Mrs. Methuen with laughter in her eyes as she
turned to Edmund as being plainly the most communicative of the party.

"Well, we thought it very likely you had come to complain," Edmund
continued, "and that is always rather beastly."

Mrs. Methuen did not possess six brothers without a familiarity with
such possibilities. She did not press for an explanation, but tactfully
changed the subject.  Nor had she been in the room five minutes before
she discovered that man and boys were all equally incapable of starting
to housekeep, and that everything was in a desperately uncomfortable
state.  She herself had been at a "Hall."  She knew Mrs. Griffin’s type,
and the very tea-table told its own dismal tale.  She was young,
kind-hearted, and energetic; nor had she been in Oxford long enough to
achieve the indifference to the affairs of outsiders that is said to
characterise the inhabitants of that city.  So she promptly asked them
all three to lunch on the morrow, nor would she take any denial; and she
further suggested that the boys should walk back with her there and then
so that they would know where to come.

The boys were charmed, and the three set off down the street, while Mr.
Wycherly watched them from the front door till they turned the corner
into Mansfield Road.  He went up to his study unaccountably cheered and
comforted.

"After all," he reflected, "I might ask that most charming young lady
for advice if we fall into any serious dilemma.  She looks so extremely
alert and capable.  Nevertheless, we must try to manage our own affairs
without plaguing kind friends to assist us."

He forgot all about the curtainless windows, and set himself to unpack
the large case marked "Earlier Latin Authors" that stood by itself
nearest the door.

Mrs. Methuen took Edmund by the arm, asking confidentially: "Now what
mischief had you been up to when I came in?  What did you expect the
people to complain about?  Don’t tell me if you’d rather not, but I know
a good deal about boys, and I might be able to help."

"It wasn’t us," Edmund answered quite seriously. "It was Guardie.  He
was afraid of them grumbling.  Our one had complained already."

"Mr. Wycherly!" Mrs. Methuen repeated in astonishment.  "Oh, nonsense!
I’m perfectly sure he would never do anything anyone could complain of."

"Not willingly," said Montagu, who began to think it was time he took a
small part in the conversation, "but, you see, people in this town seem
rather huffy about curtains and blinds and things, and we’ve always
lived in the country, where no one could see in, so we never thought of
it.  We were so proud of having the electric light too, but now it seems
we’d have been better with just candles, for then, perhaps, Miss Selina
Brooks wouldn’t have written to complain.  We’d best go to bed in the
dark to-night."

"But do you mean to tell me someone wrote to complain that they could
see you?"

"Yes, she did," cried Edmund.  "’Paforming our ablutions’ and ’it was
very depressing,’ and Guardie thinks the lady in the house opposite him
will be writing next—you see, there’s two houses opposite us; we’re kind
of between them, and one can see right into our room and the other right
into his; but his bed’s in a deep recess, so perhaps he wasn’t quite so
depressing."

Mrs. Methuen stood still in the middle of the road, seemingly not quite
sure whether to laugh or to cry.  Finally she laughed, but her voice was
not very steady as she said: "Oh, poor dear Mr. Wycherly; how dreadful!"

"Oh, do you think," cried Montagu, "that you could tell us where we
could buy blinds or something now, to-night?  Such things do worry him
so, and then he blames himself and remembers Aunt Esperance is away, and
it feels so sad somehow.  You see she always did everything like that."

"But that’s the very sort of thing I can help in," cried this kind and
understanding young lady, and this time she took Montagu’s arm, so that
they all three were linked confidingly together.  "Did you bring no
curtains from Scotland?"

"I don’t know what we brought.  There’s boxes and boxes not unpacked
yet.  Perhaps it will be better when the servant comes, but you never
saw such a muddle as there is just now," groaned Montagu.

"But why isn’t your servant there to help you?  It seems to me that just
now is the time when she could be of the very greatest use."

"She was coming," Edmund said gloomily, "but her miserable mother went
and got ill, and now she won’t come at all, and there’s only Mrs.
Griffin.  Do you know Mrs. Griffin?"

"I do not," Mrs. Methuen replied decidedly, "and from what I saw of her
when she let me in, I don’t desire her further acquaintance.  How did
you get her?"

"It was the man in the blue cotton jacket; we asked him, and he gave us
a lot of names, but we chose Mrs. Griffin ’cause she lived so near and
we liked her name.  We got her, not Guardie."

"That, I should think, is a comforting reflection for Mr. Wycherly,"
Mrs. Methuen murmured; "but here we are.  Now I’ll take you in to see my
baby and meanwhile I’ll find some curtains and come back with you, and
we’ll put them up with tapes; that’ll do anyway until Monday.  You’ll be
well shrouded from the public gaze and can depress nobody—what a curious
way to put it though."

"It was ’distressing,’ not ’depressing,’" Montagu explained.

"Well, she depressed Guardie anyhow.  I’ll go into the attic when I get
home, and if I can see the least little bit of her doing anything _I’ll_
write and complain."

"You won’t be able to see," Montagu said sadly; "she sleeps at the top,
and her house is higher than ours—I saw her open her window yesterday
while I was in bed."

"You wait," said Edmund, wagging his curly head.  "I bet you I’ll see
something somehow—and then I’ll punish her for vexing Guardie."

"I expect she only meant to be kind," Mrs. Methuen suggested.  "She
probably realised that you, none of you, had thought of anyone seeing
in."

"She might have waited a wee while," said Edmund, not at all disposed to
take a charitable view of Miss Selina Brooks; "one can’t have everything
straight in a new house all in a minute.  Why is your house like a
church outside?"

Mrs. Methuen laughed.  "It isn’t in the least like a church inside.
Come and see!" and as she opened the front door the boys followed her
into a square hall furnished like a room.  It was a big house, and
extremely comfortable, with wide staircase and easy steps not half so
steep as those in Holywell.

Mrs. Methuen ran up very fast, the boys after her.

She took them into a room where a plump, pink baby, about eighteen
months old, had just been bathed and was sitting smiling and majestic on
the nurse’s knee.  His clothing, it was a boy baby, as yet consisted of
a flannel band; while a dab of violet powder on one cheek gave him a
rakish air.

"My precious," said Mrs. Methuen, kissing the scantily attired one; "you
must look after these gentlemen for me for a few minutes;" and she
forthwith vanished from the room.

The nurse smiled and nodded to them.  The baby remarked, "Mamma!" to no
one in particular, and looked puzzled and hurt that she could tear
herself away so soon.  He wasn’t used to it.

Edmund and Montagu advanced shyly towards their youthful host.

"Say how d’you do to the nice young gentlemen, like a good baby," said
the nurse in tones that subtly combined command and supplication.

"Do," said the baby obediently.

"Will I turn for him?" asked Edmund, who had an idea that infants must
always be amused or else they cried.  Without waiting for an affirmative
he flung himself over on his hands and turned Catherine wheels right
round the room.  Edmund was light and active and an adept in the art.
The baby was charmed.  His fat sides shook with delighted laughter, and
he shouted gleefully, "Adain!"

Nurse deftly slipped a little shirt over his head and a flannel
nightgown over that, and behold! he sat clothed and joyous on her knee
before Edmund had finished his second acrobatic feat.

Edmund walked on his hands.  He did handsprings.  He turned somersaults,
and finally played leap-frog with Montagu, but whatever he did that
insatiable baby shouted, "Adain," bouncing up and down on his nurse’s
knee in enthusiastic appreciation of the entertainment.

Meanwhile Mrs. Methuen had found and packed up two pairs of thick
cream-coloured casement curtains.  She ran tapes in them ready to put
up, for she was convinced there would be no rods; she also packed a
hammer and nails, but she never knew what it was caused her to slip her
travelling flask of brandy into the pocket of her coat.

She fetched the boys, and her small son roared in indignation at their
departure, which upset her extremely.

However, it was getting late and the windows in Holywell were bare.

Meanwhile Mr. Wycherly had been working very hard: stooping and lifting,
carrying and stretching, to arrange the Earlier Latin Authors in the top
shelf of an empty bookcase. Some of the authors were heavy and
calf-bound and Mr. Wycherly, who had eaten hardly anything at all that
day, began to feel very tired.  He was quite unused to violent exercise
of any kind, and presently he became conscious of a most unpleasant pain
in his left side.  "A stitch, I suppose," he said to himself and went on
stooping and lifting, for he had come to the last layer of books and
wanted to feel that one case at any rate was unpacked.

The boys and Mrs. Methuen returned, but he didn’t hear them.

"I’ll go upstairs and begin at once," said Mrs. Methuen, "and you
needn’t tell Mr. Wycherly anything about it till I’ve gone."

She and Edmund went up into Mr. Wycherly’s bedroom while Montagu tried
to find his guardian.  He was not in either of the sitting-rooms.  That
they had seen from the windows before they came in.  Nor was he in the
kitchen or the garden.  At last Montagu bethought him of the hitherto
unused study, climbed the steep, crooked staircase, and went down the
sloping passage to look.

Mrs. Methuen was standing on a chair at one side of the window fastening
the tape of a curtain round a nail she had just knocked in, while Edmund
stood on another chair at the other side, holding the rest of the
curtain that its fairness might not be sullied by contact with the
extremely dusty floor, when Montagu burst into the room looking very
frightened.

"D’you think you could come?" he asked breathlessly.  "I’m afraid
Guardie’s ill or something, he’s so white and he doesn’t seem able to
speak for gasping."

Down went the nice curtains in an untidy heap on the dressing-table as
Mrs. Methuen leapt off the chair, seized something from her coat which
was lying on the bed, and followed Montagu.  Edmund had already gone.

Mr. Wycherly was sitting huddled up in his chair.  His face looked wan
and drawn in the fading light; he certainly was breathing heavily and
with great difficulty.  But when he saw Mrs. Methuen he made an
ineffectual attempt to rise.  She tore the silver cup from the bottom of
the flask and tumbled the contents hastily into it.

"Don’t try to get up," she said as she knelt down beside him; "you’re a
little faint; drink this, please, at once."

She literally poured the brandy down Mr. Wycherly’s throat.  "Clear
those books off the sofa, boys," she commanded; "carefully now! Ah,
that’s better.  Now you must lie down for a few minutes; it’s bad to sit
forward like that."

Somehow in three minutes this energetic young lady had taken entire
command of the situation.  Mr. Wycherly was helped on to the sofa,
Edmund had fetched a rug to cover him, and she and Montagu were
wrestling with the huge gothic window, which should have opened like a
door in the centre and was, apparently, hermetically sealed.  At last it
yielded to their combined efforts, and the sweet, fresh evening air
rushed into the room.

"Please finish the brandy," said Mrs. Methuen in precisely the same
voice in which she would have adjured her baby not to leave any milk in
his bottle.  "You’re completely done up; no proper food, no fresh air.
I never felt anything like the atmosphere of this room; and then
stooping and lifting heavy books on the top of all the rest.  No wonder
your heart gave out.  I can’t think why they make the cups of flasks
such an awkward shape."

Mr. Wycherly meekly took the cup from her hand and drained it.  Already
his face looked less ashy and he could speak.

"I cannot tell you," he began——

"Don’t try to tell us anything yet; for five minutes you are to stay
perfectly quiet.  I’ll leave Montagu in charge, and he is not to allow
you to stir till I come back.  Come, Edmund."

Edmund’s round face was very serious as he followed Mrs. Methuen back to
the bedroom. Aunt Esperance, as he always put it, "was away."  Aunt
Esperance, who had seemed a necessary part of life—beneficent,
immutable, inevitable.  Yet she had gone, and her place knew her no
more.  Might not a like thing happen to Mr. Wycherly?  And, if so, what
was to become of him and Montagu?

Edmund was not imaginative.  He lived his jolly life wholly without
thought of the morrow.  But at that moment he was startled into a
realisation of how much he loved his guardian.

As once more he and Mrs. Methuen mounted their two chairs and started to
put up the curtains again he looked across at her and noted with a
sudden painful contraction of the heart that her face was very grave.

"You don’t think, do you," he asked in a low voice, "that Guardie is
going to die?"

Mrs. Methuen started and nearly dropped the curtain.  "Oh, dear, no,"
she exclaimed hastily; "but you must take more care of him and not let
him lift books or anything of that sort. When people are not very young
they have to take things easily.  You and Montagu must unpack the books
and he can arrange them, but you must not let him stoop over the cases.
Do you understand?  He mustn’t do it."

They finished the curtains in no time, and when Mrs. Methuen went back
to the study Mr. Wycherly hastily arose from the sofa, where he had lain
obediently ever since she put him there.

"I don’t know how to thank you," he began——

"Please don’t try," Mrs. Methuen said briskly.  "The boys and I are
having such fun, but I’m sorry to say that I must—I simply must—give you
a little lecture.  Boys! someone is knocking at the front door; go down
and see who it is while I scold Mr. Wycherly."

Mrs. Methuen’s own kitchen-maid, accompanied by a stout, fresh-coloured
woman, carrying a large brown-paper parcel, were at the door, and Mrs.
Methuen herself came down in a minute or two, when she explained that
the rosy woman was one Mrs. Dew, that she had come "to look after them,"
and would stay with them till they got a proper servant. Moreover, the
kitchen-maid carried a large basket of provisions.  The fires had gone
out in both kitchen and dining-room, and the evening was growing chill.
That kitchen-maid lit both in no time.  Mr. Wycherly was brought
downstairs and installed in his big chair by the dining-room fire, and
Mrs. Methuen went home. Yet once more she came back that night, and she
swept the two boys up to their room and insisted on their putting all
their clothes in drawers and cupboards under her supervision, and she
and Mrs. Dew did the same by Mr. Wycherly without informing him of the
fact.

Nothing could less have resembled the methods of Mrs. Griffin than those
of Mrs. Dew. With her advent everything was changed at the house in
Holywell.  Order was evolved out of chaos, dust disappeared as if by
magic, boxes were unpacked and removed empty to the attic, while, most
important of all, meals were punctual and appetising.

Mrs. Dew had the extremely deferent manner of the well-trained servant
who has "lived in good families."  To Mr. Wycherly this manner was
immensely soothing, coming as it did after his long experience of the
dictatorial and somewhat familiar bearing of the Scottish servants at
Remote.  Mrs. Dew "knew her place" and kept to it rigidly, and Edmund
found her rather unapproachable.  Anything like reserve in his
intercourse with his fellow-creatures was abhorrent to Edmund, and he
pursued Mrs. Dew with questions as to her past, her present, and her
future, getting, however, but small satisfaction for his pains.

"Have you any children, Mrs. Dew?" he demanded one day, when he had
sought her in the kitchen for social purposes.

"No, sir, not of my own."

"Any grandchildren?"

"Certainly not, sir."

"No one belonging to you at all?"

"Of course, sir, I ’ave my relations, same as other folks."

"What sort of relations?"

"Well, for one, sir, I have a niece."

"Big or little?"

"About your own size, sir, though, I daresay, she’s a bit older."

"Where does she live?"

"With me, sir, when she isn’t at school. She’s an orphan."

"Oh, like us.  Where is she now?"

"Here, in Oxford."

"What’s her name?"

"Jane-Anne, sir; but if I may say so, I don’t think the kitchen’s the
proper place for a young gentleman like you."

"When shall I see Jane-Anne?"

"I don’t suppose as you’ll see her at all, sir, your paths in life
being, so to speak, different."

Edmund sighed.  "I wish you were a more telling sort of person, Mrs.
Dew," he said sadly. "If you like to ask me any questions, you’ll soon
see what a lot I’d tell you."

"I hope I know my place better, sir!" Mrs. Dew remarked primly.

That afternoon he gave it up as a bad job.

Edmund did not forget his grudge against Miss Selina Brooks.  By some
curious mental process of unreasoning he traced Mr. Wycherly’s sudden
faintness, that had frightened them so much, to that good lady’s letter
about the curtainless windows.  She had worried his Guardie, and
therefore she was his enemy.

It did not in the least affect Edmund’s opinion of her that Mr. Wycherly
wrote a most courteous note thanking her for hers.

Edmund intended to be even with Miss Selina Brooks, but he bided his
time.

The attics in Holywell were particularly large and splendid.  There were
only two, and they occupied the whole of the top floor, while each was
reached by a separate staircase, and had no communication with the
other.  In all, there were five different sets of stairs in that old
house. One attic was dedicated to the reception of empty boxes; but the
other—which possessed a heavenly little crooked room opening out of it,
in that third gable which boasted the small square window looking
sideways down the street—Mr. Wycherly had given to the boys for their
very own play-room.

At present there was nothing in it save two or three derelict chairs and
a four-post bed with canopy and voluminous white dimity curtains. For
some reason best known to herself, Mrs. Griffin had put up the curtains
belonging to this bed which nobody wanted.

Just outside one of the doors on that landing was a curious little
cupboard with strong oak doors, not more than three feet high.  This
cupboard was very dark, apparently very deep, and quite devoid of
shelves or pegs.

During their first uncomfortable days the boys had not felt particularly
interested in cupboards; but as things grew more peaceful and accustomed
Edmund of the inquiring mind discovered this particular cubby-house.
Montagu was not with him at the time, as now that they were settled, he
did Greek for an hour every morning with Mr. Wycherly just before
luncheon.

Edmund thrust his arm in as far as it would go, but couldn’t reach the
back, though the floor seemed to slope upwards.  Carefully propping the
door open with a chair, he crawled in on hands and knees.  Once in, he
found that floor and roof sloped steeply upwards and the roof was just
over his head, he couldn’t even kneel. He crawled further in, quite a
long way, and the tunnel turned sharply to the right.  He could no
longer see the glimmer of light from the landing, but he had reached the
end of the tunnel. At the same moment his head struck something that
stuck out, and when he put up his hand he felt that it was a key by its
shape.  This was most exciting and must be investigated at once. There
was no room to turn, so Edmund half crawled, half slid backwards out of
the sloping tunnel, and flew downstairs to get some matches. To his joy
he met nobody, which was as well, for he was covered with dust and
cobwebs from head to foot.  He rushed upstairs again feeling very
adventurous and important, and once more crawled into the cupboard to
the very end of the tunnel.  He struck a match and found that he was up
against another door, in the roof this time and precisely like the first
one in every respect except that it had a large, heavy lock at one side,
and in the lock was the rusty key that had hit him on the head.  By no
endeavour could Edmund get that key to turn.  He lit match after match,
throwing them carelessly on the old oak floor in a fashion that would
have made Mr. Wycherly’s hair stand on end had he seen it, and finally
decided that alone he could not manage that door, and that Montagu must
be taken into the secret.

Montagu was still closeted with Mr. Wycherly, so Edmund wandered into
the kitchen, where Mrs. Dew, exclaiming at his appearance, promptly
dusted, brushed, and washed him, much to his annoyance.  However, he
bore it with as good grace as possible, and then with disarming meekness
asked: "What do you do, Mrs. Dew, when a key won’t turn; an old sort of
key in an iron lock?"

"Have you been down in the cellar, Master Edmund?" Mrs. Dew asked
suspiciously.  "Is that where you got all that dust and cobwebs? You’ve
no business there, you know, meddlin’ with locks."

"I haven’t been near the cellar," Edmund answered indignantly; "dust and
cobwebs seem just to come and sit on me wherever I go; I can’t help it.
But what do you do to a box, now, that won’t open?" he added
diplomatically, "when the key sticks and won’t turn?"

"You wait till afternoon, sir, and I’ll help you to open any box you
want opened.  But you might go and oil the lock if you like, then it can
soak in till I come."

Edmund joyfully accepted the little bottle of oil and the feather that
Mrs. Dew offered him, and flew upstairs again.  This time he borrowed
the candle from beside Mr. Wycherly’s bed, lighted it, and took it with
him.

Into his cupboard he went.  He oiled and oiled: himself, the lock, the
door, and the floor. He tried the key with one hand, he tried it with
two.  He got fearfully hot and exceedingly cross, and still that key
refused to turn.  Finally, in a rage, he put his shoulders under the
door and heaved with all his might.  The door in the roof seemed to
yield a little, and this inspired Edmund to further efforts.  He shoved
and shoved, and pushed and pushed, till at last, quite suddenly, the
whole thing gave, opening upwards and outwards.  Edmund’s head emerged
into the light of day, and with rapture he discovered that he had only
to step out on to the flat roof of a portion of the next house, which
was considerably higher than Mr. Wycherly’s.

His mysterious door was a skylight that had been boarded in.  Why that
curious tunnel was cut off from the rest of the house they never knew,
but the little square of leads was a source of infinite joy to Edmund
and Montagu till they grew too wide to wiggle through the passage. Nor
did Edmund, with the curious reticence of children, inform either Mr.
Wycherly or Mrs. Dew of his find.

A low parapet faced the street, and sloping slate roofs formed the two
other sides of this delightful square.  Edmund advanced to the edge of
the parapet.  He found that he looked straight across the road into a
top bedroom of the house opposite.  A bedroom so high that it had only
curtains, ordinary dark curtains, not drawn at all; no short blind, and
only a low dressing-table and small looking-glass to fill up the window.
Edmund sat down hastily lest he should be seen, for there was somebody
in the room opposite.  Somebody with bare arms who was doing her hair.

Cautiously Edmund’s head appeared above the parapet, and a look of
vindictive glee overspread his hot and dirty face.

It was Miss Selina Brooks herself, and fate had delivered her into his
hands.

The hair of Miss Selina Brooks was not abundant, and she added to it
sundry tresses such as are described by fashion-papers as "graceful
adjuncts."  Edmund waited till the adjuncts were all in their proper
place.  Then he descended into his passage, shut the oak skylight, shut
also the little gothic door leading to this undreamt-of paradise,
retired to the bath-room to wash, lest Mrs. Dew should catch him again;
and then, very quietly, went downstairs to the parlour, where, in the
words of the French exercise, he sought "pens, ink and paper."

Edmund did not possess the pen of a ready writer; it was some time
before he drafted a letter to his liking, but in its final form the
missive ran thus:—


"DEAR MADDUM,

"I think it only right to inform you that I can see you doing your hair,
both what is on and what is off, and I find it very depressing. I
therefore venture to suggest that a blind should be affixed without
delay.  It’s worse than ablushuns.

"Yours truly,
       "EDMUND BETHUNE ESQRE."


This Edmund folded and placed in an envelope, which he sealed with his
great-grandfather’s seal.  He then trotted across the road and dropped
it into Miss Selina Brooks’ letter-box.

Unlike Mr. Wycherly, Miss Brooks did not write to thank Edmund Bethune,
Esqre. for his information; but that afternoon Nottingham lace curtains
were put up at that top window, so closely drawn that not even a chink
remained between them.  When he beheld them Edmund smiled seraphically.




                             *CHAPTER III*

                             *THE PRINCESS*

    "Thro’ light and shadow thou dost range,
      Sudden glances, sweet and strange,
    Delicious spites and darling angers,
      And airy forms of flitting change."
        LORD TENNYSON.


There were white curtains at the windows in all the front rooms now. Mr.
Wycherly’s books were ranged on their appointed shelves and the packing
cases removed to the attic.  Mrs. Dew was admitted to the study with
duster and broom, and it began to look home-like and habitable.  Once
more did Mr. Wycherly sit at his knee-hole table engaged in his great
work upon the Nikomachean ethics.  The family was settling down.

"Will everybody come and see us now they know we’re here?" asked Edmund,
who had invaded the study one afternoon just after luncheon.

"I’m not at all sure that anyone will come and see us," Mr. Wycherly
answered serenely. "Why should they?"

"Oh, well, for friendliness.  How are we to get to know people if they
don’t come and see us?  Shall we go and see them?"

"Certainly not," Mr. Wycherly said hastily. "That would be pushing and
impertinent."

"But I like knowing folks," Edmund persisted. "I knew everybody at
Burnhead."

"Burnhead is a little village.  Oxford is a big town, and in big towns
people are too busy to concern themselves about newcomers."

"Not Mrs. Methuen," Edmund argued.  "She takes a great interest in us."

"She is a kind and gracious lady," said Mr. Wycherly, "but you mustn’t
expect everybody to be like Mrs. Methuen."

"I don’t want them to be like her.  I want them to be different; but I
want some more people to come soon.  I know the milkman, of course, and
the butcher and two postmen (we’d only one in Burnhead), but that’s not
enough. You see they don’t come in and have a crack. The butcher’s an
awfully nice man.  I wish you knew him, Guardie.  Why don’t they ever
come in?"

"I expect they are too busy.  As it is, it seems to me that some
people’s meat must arrive very late if you have already found time to
discover the butcher’s amiable qualities during his morning visit."

"You should hear him whistle," Edmund persisted. "I’d give anything to
whistle like him."

Mr. Wycherly did not answer.  His mental attitude with regard to the
butcher’s musical efforts was coldly unsympathetic.

"Why do you never whistle, Guardie?"

"I don’t feel the smallest desire to whistle."

"But, _why_ don’t you?"

Just at this moment Mrs. Dew appeared bearing a tray with a visiting
card upon it, while behind her came Montagu, breathless with excitement,
to announce that "a lady and a gentleman and a wee girl were waiting in
the parlour to see Mr. Wycherly."

On the card were the names of "Mr. and Mrs. William Wycherly."

"There, Edmund," said Mr. Wycherly, "you’ve got your wish.  Here are
visitors, and one of them is an old friend," and looking really pleased
he hastened downstairs to the parlour, followed by the boys.

Seated in the deep window-seat was a tall young lady with fair hair;
beside her was a little girl, and a gentleman was standing on the
hearthrug.  As Mr. Wycherly came in the lady crossed the room towards
him holding out both her hands.  She seemed extraordinarily glad to see
him, and he held the friendly hands in his for quite a long time, while
she laughed and blushed and introduced her husband. Then she turned to
the boys: "Do neither of you remember me?  Six years is a long time—but
you might, Montagu?"

"Weren’t you bonnie Margaret?" Montagu asked shyly.

"She is bonnie Margaret," said Mr. Wycherly, "and this is my nephew."

"Nobody is taking any notice of me," said a clear, high voice, and the
handshaking group in the middle of the room turned to look at the little
figure standing all lonely in the window-seat.

"That is our daughter Herrick," laughed Mrs. Wycherly; "a very important
person—quite unused to be overlooked."

This was evident.  The small girl stood in the seat silhouetted against
the window, a quaint, sedately fearless little figure with a somewhat
reproving expression on the round face framed in a Dutch bonnet.  Under
the bonnet and over her shoulders billowed masses of yellow curls that
broke into misty clouds of fine spun floss that caught and held the
April sunshine.  Her short-waisted coat, reaching nearly to her heels,
was of a warm tan-colour, and she carried a large, imposing-looking muff
of the same material bordered with fur.

Her mother lifted her down and led her to Mr. Wycherly, who bowed
gravely over the small hand extended to him, but did not kiss her, as
she evidently expected him to do; for she looked at him with large,
trustful eyes, smiling the while a confident smile that showed even
white teeth and deliciously uneven dimples in cheeks as fresh and pink
as the almond blossom just then bursting into flower.

Mrs. William Wycherly was Lady Alicia’s youngest daughter.  Montagu
vaguely remembered that there was a great fuss at the time of bonnie
Margaret’s marriage, and that he had heard it whispered that she had run
away and that her mother was very angry.  So he looked with great
interest at the gracious and beautiful young woman who had been so kind
to them when they were little.  Certainly retribution did not appear to
have overtaken her. She looked radiantly well and happy, and Montagu
decided that her husband looked kind and pleasant.  Herrick stood
leaning up against her mother’s knee, silently taking stock first of
Montagu, then of Edmund, then of Montagu again, turning her gravely
scrutinising eyes from one to the other without a trace of embarrassment
or shyness.

Presently Mr. Wycherly suggested that the boys should show Herrick the
garden.

"Will you go with them, darling?" asked her mother, and Herrick,
evidently satisfied with her investigations, declared her willingness to
do so.

Once outside the parlour door, the steep, crooked staircase attracted
her attention.

"I’d like to go up that; can I, boy?" she asked Edmund.

"Let’s take her and show her our attic," he suggested.  Edmund loved the
attics.

"Shall I carry you?" asked Montagu; "it’s a long stair."

"Certainly not," said the little girl with great dignity; "peoples as
old as me always walk upstairs."

She fell up a good many times during the ascent, for she kept stepping
on her long coat in front, and every time she tripped she said: "Oh,
dear, how tahsome!"

At length they reached the attic, and the moment she saw the four-post
bed with the curtains she made a dart towards it, crying joyfully, "Oh,
what a beautiful castle it will make.  Now we can play my game."

She attempted to scramble up on to the bed, but again the coat got in
the way and prevented her.

"Please take it off," she commanded, standing quite still, "and my
bonnet."

Montagu unbuttoned the coat and untied the strings of the bonnet.

"That’s better," she said; "now we can begin."

In a moment she was up on the bed and had darted behind the curtains
which she immediately drew closely till she was well hidden.

Montagu and Edmund looked at one another. What in the world did this
portend?

Presently the curtains were parted a little, and a round, rosy face
appeared in the aperture.

The boys stood at the end of the bed looking awkward and sheepish.

"Go on," she said impatiently; and she stamped her foot.  "You must
_say_ it now."

"But we don’t know what to say.  Is it a game like proverbs, or what?"
asked Edmund.

Herrick sighed, and stepped out from behind the curtains.  "I suppose I
must esplain," she said, "but I thought everybody knowed that game; it’s
my most favourite play.  This," she said, waving her hand dramatically,
"is a _gloomy_ wood"—mere printers’ ink can never depict the darkness
and density of that wood as portrayed in Herrick’s voice—"and you are a
wandering prince."

"Which of us?" asked Edmund; "or are we both princes?"

"No, there can’t be two, there can only be one.  You’d better be him,"
she said, pointing to Montagu, "you’re the biggest, and the littler one
can be his servant."

"A varlet," Montagu, who was just then much under the influence of Sir
Walter Scott, suggested helpfully.

"A Scotch varlet, mind," Edmund stipulated.

"And presently you see," continued the little girl as though there had
been no interruption of any kind, "a most frowning sort of castle, but
just as you’re wondering what you’ll do there appears at the window——"

"Castles haven’t got windows," Edmund objected, "only kind of slits."

"This castle has a casement," Herrick responded with dignity.  "Don’t
interrupt—and the curtains are drawn, but pesenly they are drawn back,
and then you see _the_ most beautiful princess you ever dreamed of——"

"And then?" asked Montagu.

"Why, you go down on your knees, of course, and say so.  Now, let’s
begin; you do need such a lot of esplanation."

The princess retired behind her curtains; the prince and the varlet, who
manifested an unseemly inclination to giggle, marched about the room.

"By my halidome!" exclaimed the prince, who had determined to play the
part after the fashion of his then favourite characters, "this place is
stoutly fortified."

"Will we win through, think ye?" asked the varlet familiarly.

"Hush!" said a voice from behind the curtains.

They were parted.  First the ravishingly lovely countenance (it really
was an adorably pretty little face, intensely solemn and earnest)
appeared, then more of the princess, till she stood revealed in short
embroidered muslin frock and a blue sash.

Flump!  Prince and varlet went down on their knees.

"What light from yonder window breaks?" exclaimed the prince, who had
been doing "Romeo and Juliet" at school, and thought the quotation
appropriate.

"An’ wha’ll yon lassie be, prince?" asked the varlet.

"I," said the princess slowly and solemnly, "_I_ am the Princess
Hildegarde——"

"Losh me!" interjected the varlet.

"Silence, dog!" said the prince severely. "How came you here, fair
lady?"

"I am imprisoned in this dreadful castle," the princess continued
plaintively, "by a wicked baron, an enemy of my kingly father."

"Where is the baron, lady?  That we may slay him!" valiantly exclaimed
the prince.

"Is your faither deed?" further inquired the varlet, who really was
shockingly familiar.

"He died"—here the princess faltered and looked almost as though she
might weep at any moment—"while I was yet a babe, nigh upon forty years
ago."

"That’s a long time," murmured the prince thoughtfully.

"It is," the princess agreed, "and meanwhile my evil cousin has usurped
the throne——  Now let us do it all over again."  Here she spoke in a
perfectly natural voice.  "Perhaps you’ll be a bit better this time.
You ought to be much more surprised when I first appear, you ought to be
struck dumb with amazement and delight, and then say all sorts of
beautiful things.  You should see my daddie do it."

"No, no," protested the varlet, as he arose and rubbed his knees, "we’ve
got to find that old baron first and kill him.  Wouldn’t you like to be
the baron now for a change?"

"Certainly not," said the princess with great dignity.  "I’m only the
princess always; we never have killings or horrid things of that sort.
Are you ready?"

"Wouldn’t you like to see the garden?" Montagu suggested; "it’s very
very pretty."

"I’ve seen plenty of gardens, thank you. This town is all over gardens.
Are you ready?"

The princess was once more shrouded by her curtains.  Edmund looked
despairingly at Montagu.

"Shall we show her our secret place?" he whispered.  "We simply can’t
play that silly old game all over again."

"She’s got such a smart frock on," Montagu objected.  "Suppose she got
dirty."

"What secret place?" asked the princess, emerging from behind the
curtains.

"It’s a wee tunnel, and you go up it and come out on the roof, but you’d
spoil your dress.  Are you going to a party, that you’re so fine?"

"I’m not fine," the princess cried indignantly. "It’s just an or’nary
dress; it’ll wash. _Do_ show me the secret place."

"Will you promise not to play princess when we get there?" Edmund
demanded.

"Not if you don’t like it," she answered, looking very surprised; "but
it’s such a lovely game."

"Hush! they’re calling us," Montagu exclaimed; "we must go down."

"But the secret place," cried Herrick.  "I must see the secret place."

"You can’t now; we must go.  Next time, perhaps.  All right, Guardie,
we’re coming.  Here, you’d better let me carry you, the stairs are
awfully steep.  Bring her coat and things, Edmund."

This time the princess consented, and Montagu staggered downstairs
bearing this precious and, for him, exceedingly heavy burden.

"What have you been doing, children?" Mrs. Wycherly asked.

"I didn’t want to go in the garden," Herrick said as if that explained
everything.  "So we went upstairs and there was a lovely bed and we
played princess, but they’re not good.  They didn’t do it really well.
You and daddie are much better."

Mrs. Wycherly looked across at her husband and laughed.  "One needs
educating up to that game," she said.  "I daresay Edmund and Montagu
will play it very well when they’ve got little girls of their own."

"They didn’t seem to ’preciate me much," the child said sadly, "but,"
tolerantly, "they did their best.  I like the big one, he’s more
respectful."

When their visitors had gone, Edmund sought Mr. Wycherly and climbed
upon his knee.

"Funny little kid, wasn’t she?" he said.

"She is a remarkably beautiful child."

"Yes, she is nice to look at; all that hair’s so jolly.  We were very
good to her, Guardie, really; we did everything she asked us once—but we
really couldn’t do it all over again."

"Do what all over again?"

"Oh, be princes and admire her, and rubbish. She wouldn’t let us kill
the wicked baron or anything really jolly like that."

"You’ve had very little to do with girls, ever," Mr. Wycherly said
thoughtfully.  "It is rather a pity.  I sometimes wish we knew some nice
little girls for you to play with.  They have, I expect, a refining
influence."

"I don’t want any refining influences if it’s princesses and that sort
of thing.  I couldn’t go on doing it to please anybody."

"She’s only a baby, Edmund.  You liked all sorts of queer games when you
were very little. I’m sure I’d be quite willing to play princes or
anything else to please the young lady."

"And go down on your knees?"

"Certainly," said Mr. Wycherly, who, however, looked rather startled,
"if it gave her pleasure."

"I suppose we gave her pleasure," Edmund grumbled, "but she didn’t seem
over-pleased, somehow.  I can’t think _what_ she wanted, really."

"Perhaps she didn’t know herself."

"Oh, yes, she did, for she was so sure we were doing it wrong."

"Perhaps," suggested Mr. Wycherly, with unconscious irony, "it is a
better game for two."

"Well, you won’t catch Montagu and me playing that game anyhow."

"Who knows—some day," said Mr. Wycherly.




                              *CHAPTER IV*

                           *THE BEGGAR MAID*

    "Who loves me? dearest father, mother sweet,
    I speak the names out sometimes by myself,
    And make the silence shiver.  They sound strange,
    As Hindostani to an Ind-born man
    Accustomed many years to English speech;
    Or lovely poet-words grown obsolete,
    Which will not leave off singing."
      E. B. BROWNING.


That evening, after the princess and her parents had gone, Mrs. Dew
asked Mr. Wycherly if she might "pop out" for an hour or so before
supper just to run home and see that all was well.

Mrs. Dew always "popped," and according to herself, invariably ran,
though such modes of progression seemed hardly in keeping with her
stout, comfortable figure.

Before she left, she warned the boys to listen for knocks and rings
during her absence—"though ’tisn’t likely," she said, "as anyone’ll come
to the side-door; the tradespeople’s all been."

Mr. Wycherly was shut in his study and the boys were preparing to go out
into the garden where they assuredly would hear no knocks or rings, when
there came a faint and timid rap at the side-door.

Edmund rushed to open it, and there stood a little girl of about twelve,
who asked in a modest whisper: "Please, sir, can I see my aunt a
minute?"

"Is Mrs. Dew your aunt?" Edmund demanded.

"Yes, sir, please, sir.  Can I see her?"

"She’s just gone out, not five minutes ago."

"Oh dear," sighed the little girl, "then I must have missed her."

"Was she going to see you, do you think?" Edmund asked.  He always took
the deepest interest in his fellow creatures.

"I expect so, but there’s so many ways one can come.  I shall be certain
to miss her again going back and then——"

"And then," Edmund repeated.

"She’ll be cross with me," the little girl replied, and smiled at
Edmund.

Edmund smiled back and a friendly, confidential spirit was at once
established.

They looked at each other in silence for a minute.

The visitor was dressed in a brown stuff frock of some stiff, unyielding
woolen material.  She wore a buff coloured cape reaching to the waist
and a hat of black straw, trimmed with a brown ribbon, of that
inverted-pie-dish shape seemingly peculiar to female orphans educated in
charitable institutions, for no other mortal ever wears such an one.

The pale face under the shadow of the inverted pie-dish was odd and
arresting.  The eyes, long-lashed and brilliant, were really brown eyes,
almost the colour of old, dark sherry; deep-set under delicately
pencilled, very black eyebrows. Her mouth was rather large with well-cut
full red lips and strong even white teeth; but her face was painfully
thin, the cheeks so hollow and the chin so sharp that her eyes dominated
everything, were out of proportion, and imparted to the beholder an
uncomfortable sense of tragedy and gloom almost painful—until she
smiled.  Then the slumbering fire in the great eyes was quenched and
they looked peaceful and pleasant as clear brown water under sunshine in
a Devonshire trout stream.

"Hadn’t you better come in and wait for your aunt?" Edmund suggested.
"If you go back now you’re certain to miss her."

"May I?" asked the little girl, smiling all over her face.  "May I?  I
hope aunt won’t mind."

"Come in," said Edmund, and shut the door.

The side-door opened straight into the scullery; then came the kitchen,
large, orderly, and comfortable; opening out of that was a housekeeper’s
room not yet completely furnished. Edmund led his guest through these
apartments and across a narrow passage to the dining-room where Montagu
was sitting on the floor fastening on his pads.

"Here’s Mrs. Dew’s niece!" Edmund announced.  "This is Montagu," he
continued. "What’s your name?  We can’t call you Mrs. Dew’s niece all
the time."

Montagu arose from the floor and shook hands in solemn silence after the
manner of boys.

"My name’s Jane-Anne, please, sir," said the little girl.

"My name’s Edmund, please, miss," that youth remarked, grinning broadly.

Jane-Anne looked surprised.  She saw nothing unusual in her mode of
address.

For a minute the three stood and stared at each other.

"Would you like," Edmund asked in tones of honeyed politeness, "to see
me bowl to him? I was just going to when you came."

"Please, sir," said Jane-Anne with commendable alacrity, "I should like
it very much."

"Perhaps," Montagu suggested, though not over hopefully, "you’d like to
field."

"Field," repeated Jane-Anne; "what’s that?"

"Run after the ball when he hits it, and throw it back to me," Edmund
explained.

"Oh, I could do that—do let me—it would be lovelly."

"Oh, you shall field as much as you like," Edmund promised graciously,
and they all went into the garden.

Jane-Anne took off her hat and cape and hung them on the roller.  It was
then to be seen that her little nose was very straight and almost in a
line with her forehead; no "dint," as Edmund called it, between the
eyes.  And her hair, parted in the centre from her brow to the nape of
her neck, was black, immensely long and thick, and tightly plaited in
two big pig-tails, each tied with a crumpled bit of brown ribbon.

Jane-Anne could run very fast and was quite a fair catch, but she could
not throw, as Montagu put it, "a hang" except in directions wholly
undesirable.  She very nearly flung one ball through Mr. Wycherly’s
study window in her endeavours to send it to Edmund bowling at the other
end of the lawn.  So it was settled that she must roll the ball along
the grass, which she did with fair precision.

The grass was wet and spongy after heavy rain that morning.  Jane-Anne’s
boots were heavy and clumsy, and when she slid, as she often did, she
peeled the grass right off.

"I say," Montagu exclaimed, "you’re making a frightful mess of the
grass.  I think you’d better stop fielding."

"I’ll take them off," Jane-Anne exclaimed eagerly.  "I can run much
faster in my stockings."

This she did, regardless of the damp and unhindered by either of the
boys, who thought it was very "sporting" of her.

"This afternoon," said Montagu, while she was unlacing them, "we had a
little girl who insisted on playing at being a princess, and when you
came I was afraid you’d want to play something of that sort too; perhaps
the beggar maid, for a change."

"I shouldn’t ever want to _play_ that," she said very low, and to his
dismay he noticed that her mouth drooped at the corners and her eyes
were full of tears.  She stooped her head over the boot she was
unlacing, but Montagu had seen her face.

"Oh, don’t," he exclaimed.  "Whatever is the matter?  I was only in fun
and you know, in the story—it’s a poem—I read it this very afternoon—the
beggar maid became the Queen."

"_Did_ she?" cried Jane-Anne.  "Are you sure?  How lovelly!  I’d like to
play at being a princess," she added wistfully.  "It’s not much fun to
play what you are already.  You see I am a sort of beggar maid."

"Oh, nonsense," said Montagu, "you’re not in rags, your clothes look
very strong and comfortable."

"They’re strong, but they’re not at all comfortable, they’re so stiff";
and Jane-Anne rose lightly to her feet holding her arms out straight.

The brown garment was made after a fashion of many years ago—the sleeves
and body tight and skimpy and narrow-chested; the skirt unnecessarily
full and heavy.

"I think you’re rather like Mrs. Noah," said Edmund, "only you’ve more
hair and petticoats."

Jane-Anne dropped her arms, stooped, and picked up the boots.  "Aren’t
they frightful?" she said.  "That’s the asylum.  We all have to wear
them."  Whereupon she cast the boots violently away from her and they
bounded into the midst of a herbaceous border.

"Now," she said, with a little dancing movement indicative of relief,
"you’ll see that I can run."

"What was that you said about an asylum?" Edmund asked suspiciously.  "I
thought only mad people went to asylums."

"It’s the Bainbridge Asylum for female orphans," Jane-Anne explained.
"I’m female and I’m an orphan, and I wish I wasn’t.  I’m at school there
and I hate it.  But I’m generally ill, so I have to go to the hospital,
and there it’s lovelly."

"Why are you ill?" asked Edmund.

"It’s so cold.  If I go on being ill any more," she added hopefully,
"they won’t keep me. It’s because I’m an orphan I have to go—it makes it
easier for aunt."

"But we’re orphans too and we don’t go to asylums," Edmund objected.

"Ah," said Jane-Anne, "you’re rich, you see."

"Indeed we’re not," said Montagu.  "We’re very poor really; Aunt
Esperance said so."

"Poor!" echoed Jane-Anne scornfully, "and live in that beautiful house
and have Aunt Martha for a servant.  Oh, no, you can’t be poor—not
really."

"You see, there’s Guardie, he takes care of us," Montagu explained, "but
we’re really orphans, too, you know."

"Are you?  I’m so sorry," and she looked it.

"Oh, you needn’t be a bit sorry for us.  We’re very jolly, thank you,"
and Edmund spoke in rather an offended tone.  Pity was the last thing he
expected or desired.

"I beg your pardon," she said quickly.  "I know it’s quite different for
you; you’re gentry, you see."

The boys glanced at one another and were horribly uncomfortable.  In
some queer, subconscious way they felt that they had unaccountably and
unintentionally been "snobby" to Jane-Anne.

"Come on," said Edmund, "we’re wasting time."

The game was keen and exciting.  Jane-Anne flew about on her slender
stockinged feet, and in spite of the stiff brown dress, there was
something singularly fleet and graceful in her movements.

The pleasant pinky light had already changed to grey when from the house
there came the sound of a hand-bell rung vigorously.

"Mercy!" exclaimed Edmund, "that’s for us to wash.  Mrs. Dew must be
home and it’s nearly supper-time."

Montagu was already half-way to the house when Jane-Anne caught Edmund
by the arm, exclaiming, "Oh, let me get my boots.  Don’t go without me,
and don’t say I took them off. I don’t know what Aunt’d say.  I’m sure
she’ll think it forward of me to play with you."

"Rubbish," said Edmund.  "Hurry up.  We asked you, and I hope you’ll
come often.  You’d learn to chuck up a ball in time, and your running’s
simply ripping."

"Can the princess one throw balls?" Jane-Anne asked as she laced a boot
at lightning speed.

"I don’t know.  I shouldn’t think so; she’s a very little kid, you
know."

"I should like to see her; is she like a princess, really?"

"Well, she is rather.  She has a demandly sort of way as if she expected
everybody to do as she likes.  You could see her if you came to-morrow
morning.  They’re coming then, I know."

"I’d love to, but what would aunt say?  I’m certain she wouldn’t let me;
not in the morning when she’s so busy."

"You come to the front door and I’ll let you in myself and take you up
to the attic.  She’s certain to want to go back there.  She doesn’t seem
to care for gardens."

"Oh, I do," cried Jane-Anne; "gardens are lovelly; but I’ll come," she
added excitedly. "I’ll wait across the road, then you can see me from
the window and let me in.  Mind you don’t forget."

They ran back to the house and Edmund escorted Jane-Anne as far as the
kitchen, where Mrs. Dew was standing at the fireplace dishing up.

"Jane-Anne came to see you, Mrs. Dew," Edmund announced loudly from the
doorway, "but you’d just gone, so we asked her in to wait till you came
back."

Mrs. Dew turned hastily and beheld her niece standing just behind her.

"But I’ve been back over an hour," Mrs. Dew exclaimed.  "Wherever have
you been since, Jane-Anne?"

"We asked her to play cricket with us," Edmund explained.  "We never
heard you come in.  Good-bye, Jane-Anne, I must go and wash."

Wagging his curly head meaningly in token of the assignation for the
morrow, Edmund departed and Jane-Anne was left face to face with her
aunt.

"Well!" that good woman ejaculated. "You’ve given me a pretty turn.  I
couldn’t think where you was gone; evening and all, and then to think
you’ve been all this time playing with the young gentlemen like one of
theirselves, and me never so much as dreaming where you was.  What
possessed you to come at all, Jane-Anne?"

"I was lonely, Aunt Martha, I wanted to see you."

"You might have seen me over an hour ago if you’d a’ chose.  Well, now
you must run back home before it gets dark.  I can’t let you wait for me
to take you, there’s all them dinner things to wash up.  How hot you are
child! Mind you don’t catch cold, and school beginning next week."

Jane-Anne looked wistfully at the sizzling cutlets in the frying-pan.
She had started off before her tea and was very hungry.  Her aunt had
turned again to the range and was absorbed in lifting her cutlets out
one by one and setting them to drain on a dish covered with white paper.
As she carefully placed the last one, she turned and saw the flushed,
wistful little face under the shadow of the inverted pie-dish.

"There, child," she said impatiently, "don’t dawdle, it’s late enough as
it is, and Miss Morecraft ’ll be in a fine taking where you can have got
to."

"Good-night, Aunt Martha," Jane-Anne said obediently, and held up her
face to be kissed.

Mrs. Dew stooped and kissed the child with great kindness and felt in
the pocket of her skirt. "You buy a cake for your supper," she said,
pressing a penny into Jane-Anne’s hand, "on your way back.  I can’t give
you anything here for the food’s not mine, and to take my employer’s
victuals is what I never have done nor never will."

Jane-Anne flung her arms round her aunt’s neck.  "I do love you, Aunt
Martha," she whispered chokily.

"There, there, do get home, and remember that if so be as I’m out when
you call, you’re to go away again and not come in as bold as brass as if
you was a friend of the family—playing with the young gentlemen and all.
Folks ought to keep to their proper stations."

"But he asked me to come and play," Jane-Anne expostulated.

"Law bless you, Master Edmund’d ask in a tramp off the road, he’s that
full of caddle. Now look sharp, child, and get home."

Jane-Anne let herself out at the side-door and went through under the
archway into the street.  It was quite deserted, and as she passed the
dining-room window she stopped, and pressing her face against the glass,
looked in.

The electric light above the table had a rose-coloured shade and filled
the room with a warm, soft light.  A bright fire was burning on the
hearth, for the evenings were still cold and a shrewd wind blew down the
empty street.  To Jane-Anne, shivering now after being much too hot, the
room looked inexpressibly comfortable and cheery.

Mr. Wycherly, his white hair shining with a silvery radiance, was
standing with Montagu, newly promoted to a dinner-jacket on the
hearth-rug.  His hand was on the boy’s shoulder, and he smiled down at
him, for Montagu was talking eagerly.  There was evidently such perfect
confidence and affection between what Jane-Anne called "the beautiful
old gentleman" and the boy for whom she had just been fielding, that she
felt a passionate desire to be there too.  Surely anyone who looked so
gracious and benign would have a kindly word for her.  Should she rap at
the window and attract their attention?  Somehow she was certain that
neither of them would be cross.  Her eyes filled with tears, and the
figures standing on the hearth-rug became blurred and indistinct, but
she saw her aunt come in and cross towards the window to pull down the
blind.  Jane-Anne darted away, the big tears chasing each other down her
cheeks.

"I wish I was that kind of orphan!" sobbed Jane-Anne.




                              *CHAPTER V*

                            *THEIR MEETING*

    "For may not a person be only five,
    And yet have the neatest of taste alive?
    As a matter of fact, this one has views
    Of the strictest sort as to frocks and shoes."
      AUSTIN DOBSON.


Little Herrick had no companions of her own age except for an occasional
visit to cousins.  Therefore did she invent comrades for herself and
sternly impose them upon her family.

There was "Umpy dear" who, as his name suggested, was a meek,
inefficient sort of person, often in trouble of various kinds, but
always entirely amiable and desirous of pleasing. Quite other was "Mr.
Woolykneeze," a stern, characterful personality who was quoted as an
authority on all questions of manners and deportment.  Even Janet, the
commonsensical, trembled before Mr. Woolykneeze.  One day at tea, having
toothache, she had ventured to leave a piece of crust upon her plate,
when Herrick remarked it and said sternly, "Mr. Woolykneeze thinks it’s
very impolite to leave bits, ’specially crusts," and poor Janet was fain
to soak the crust in her tea and mumble it that way rather than offend
this mysterious and invisible censor.

When asked the age of "Umpy dear," Herrick always persisted that he was
"three months and one day."  He never grew any older and his social
solecisms were surely excusable in one of such tender age.  "Mrs. Miff"
was "Umpy dear’s" mother, and her character was believed to have been
founded on that of a charwoman who occasionally came to the house. Like
her offspring she was meek and rather feckless, frequently arousing the
wrath of Mr. Woolykneeze by her untidy and careless habits.

No one knew whence Herrick got the names or how she divined their
various characters, but the people were there and had come to stay, and
her family had to put up with them.

Her visit to Oxford opened up whole vistas of new possibilities.  Here
were two real boys with whom she had been allowed to play.  It is true
that they did not fall into her scheme with that instant understanding
and obedience to which she was accustomed from her parents, but still
they played after a fashion, a new and piquant fashion, and Herrick went
back to the King’s Arms after her visit to Holywell chattering
incessantly of "Monkagu" and "Emmund," and demanding an instant return
to their society.  She wept bitterly when she found she could not go
back that night, and declared that Mr. Woolykneeze and Umpy dear were
equally upset.  Her father suggested that these gentlemen might stroll
round by themselves, when Herrick, regarding him with tearful
astonishment, sobbed out: "They’d never be so unkind as to go wivout me.
Besides, Umpy dear might spill something on your uncle’s best carpet.
Can’t _I_ take them?"

"Not to-night, I fear."

"Why?"

"Because, you see, we’ve been already; it would be troublesome to go
twice."

"Why would it be troublesome?  I want to play with those little boys
again."

"They’re not very little boys, you know. They’re a great deal bigger
than you are. Perhaps they don’t care to play with little girls."

At this Herrick opened her tearful eyes wide, repeating in astonishment,
"Not care to play wiv _me_?  Why not?"

"Well, you see, boys don’t always care for the same games that girls
like."

"But they’re nice boys."

"I’m glad to hear it; still, you know, even nice boys don’t always care
to play with little girls."

Herrick sighed deeply.  It was a horrid suggestion, the more so that she
felt secretly assured that the princess game had not been a wild
success.

"I want to see the varlet again," she persisted.

"Which is the varlet?"

"The littler one.  I do want him to play wiv me."

"Perhaps he will to-morrow."

"D’rectly after breakfas’, mind; you promise."

William Wycherly promised, and Herrick went to bed to dream that
"Emmund" and "Monkagu" were walking down Holywell arm-in-arm with Umpy
dear and Mr. Woolykneeze, and that they all four called at the hotel to
take her for a walk in St. John’s Gardens.

Next morning Herrick woke very early. Janet, her Scottish nurse, was
having a fortnight’s holiday, therefore at that time her mother was her
sole guardian and attendant. Her bed was in a little dressing-room off
that of her mother, the door between the two rooms being left open.

For a little while Herrick was content to sit up and wonder at the
floors of the King’s Arms Hotel, which are not as ordinary floors, but
slope up and down in all sorts of unexpected directions.  But she soon
got tired of this, and so effectually roused her devoted parents that
the three of them were down in the coffee-room and had finished
breakfast by half-past eight.

"Now let us go and see your uncle, daddie dear," Herrick suggested as
soon as she was lifted down from her chair.  It seemed so extraordinary
to her that anyone as old as her father should have an uncle, and she
never failed to lay great stress upon the pronoun.

"We can’t possibly invade them so early as this," Margaret said firmly;
"they’re probably not downstairs yet."

"Umpy dear thinks they’re up and finished breakfast," Herrick remarked
in a detached, impersonal tone, "_and_ waiting for me."

"Well, I must beg to differ from Umpy dear. We said we’d call about ten,
and it won’t be ten for an hour and a half yet.  I must write some
letters, and you must amuse yourself somehow while I do it.  What toys
will you have?"

"I’ll look out of the window, sank you," Herrick remarked with dignity,
and climbed upon a chair that she might see over the wire blind.

Her mother gave one amused glance at the small offended back turned
towards her and went upstairs to get her writing-case.

William Wycherly, seeing his daughter apparently engrossed in her
inspection of the street, strolled to the bureau to look up trains, for
they were to leave that afternoon.

No sooner was he out of sight than Herrick, muttering something to the
effect that "Mr. Woolykneeze _knows_ they’re waiting," scrambled down
from the chair and tip-toed out to the hall and thence into the street.

No one saw her, for none of the other sojourners at the King’s Arms were
down, and at that moment there was not even a waiter in the hall.

It was a perfect April morning.  The sun shone clear and warm, and a
shy, caressing wind lifted Herrick’s curls and turned them to a haze of
golden floss as she stepped daintily to the pavement and looked up
street and down street carefully.  Then, as fast as her sturdy legs
would carry her, she ran till she reached Mr. Wycherly’s gabled house.

But there she was met by a difficulty, for she could reach neither
knocker nor bell.  For a moment she stood undecided in the doorway, but
she was not lacking in resource.  She couldn’t quite see into the
windows but she could reach them with her hand.  She selected that on
the left-hand side of the door and tapped on the glass.  No response;
evidently there was no one in that room.

She tried the other.  Still no one came to see who was there.

A passing boy, who noted her efforts, inquired good-naturedly: "Want to
get in, missie?"

"Please!  Would you ring for me?" she asked, smiling up at him in
bewitching fashion; "there doesn’t seem to be anybody in those rooms."

The boy rang loudly, knocked like a postman, and went up the street,
where he waited a few doors off to see what happened.

The door was opened.

Mrs. Dew looked down at this hatless, golden-haired person in an
elaborate blue linen smock the colour of her eyes, and recognised
yesterday’s visitor.

"Come in, my dear," she said hospitably. "They’re none of ’em down yet,
but I can hear the young gentlemen hollerin’ and rampagin’, so they
won’t be long——"  "Parents want to get her out of the way for a bit, I
expect," she thought to herself, "her mamma must get pretty tired of it
without no nurse."

Herrick followed Mrs. Dew into the dining-room, where breakfast was
laid.  "One minute, my dear," said that good woman, "I must just pop
back to my bacon and eggs, then I’ll come and see to you."

But Herrick had not come to see Mrs. Dew. No sooner was she left alone
than she sought the steep, narrow staircase and began to climb upstairs,
whispering as she went, "You’d better take my hand, Umpy dear."

Two doors on the landing were open.  The bathroom faced her, empty, and
very wet.  She walked straight through the second open door on the other
side of the landing and came upon Montagu brushing his hair at the glass
while Edmund, still in his shirt-sleeves, was practising a handspring on
the end of his bed.

Montagu saw her reflected in the mirror and in speechless astonishment
watched her as she paused well inside the doorway, announcing genially,
"We’ve all three come."

Edmund’s feet dropped to the floor with a flump.

"Mercy goodness!" Montagu ejaculated, and dashed for the door that led
into Mr. Wycherly’s room.  On this he thumped loudly; without waiting
for permission to enter, he opened it just wide enough to thrust in his
head, and repeated, "They’ve all three come," in a penetrating whisper.

Mr. Wycherly, who was shaving, dropped his razor and turned a soapy and
astonished countenance towards Montagu, exclaiming, "What! al——!" when
he hastily changed his remark to: "They’ve come to breakfast with us,
have they?  How exceedingly kind and friendly; run down at once and ask
Mrs. Dew to lay three more places."

Herrick staring at Edmund, heard this and said slowly: "They don’t
generally lay for them."

"What?" cried Edmund, immensely interested. "Don’t you have plates and
knives and things?"

"_I_ do," said Herrick; "at least not knives ’cept a silver one, but
they never do.  They _will_ be pleased."

"But do you mean to tell me," Edmund exclaimed, appalled at the
eccentricity of the Wycherly _ménage_ as revealed by their daughter,
"that they eat things right off the cloth? Whatever do they do when
there’s gravy?"

"They never has gravy, poor dears," said Herrick sadly.

Edmund sighed.  As old Elsa would have said, it was "ayont him"; and
they both looked so nice too.  It was impossible to imagine Mr. and Mrs.
Wycherly gnawing cutlets without so much as a plate between them.  He
got into his waistcoat and jacket in thoughtful silence. Montagu, who
had not paid any attention to these astonishing revelations, being
filled with hospitable concern as to whether there would be sufficient
bacon and eggs for three extra persons, gave his hair one final thump
with the brush and prepared to go downstairs.

"Stop!" cried Edmund; "you haven’t said your prayers; hurry up!"  Both
boys knelt down by the bed, side by side, while Herrick watched their
bowed heads with solemn interest.

"Why don’t you begin?" she asked impatiently after a minute’s silence.

"I’ve _done_," Edmund announced cheerfully, arising from his knees, when
Montagu followed suit and rushed downstairs.

"But you didn’t say anything."

"We don’t say prayers out loud.  It’s only very little children say them
out loud."

"Oh!" she said, as though suddenly enlightened.  "Umpy dear says his
very loud, but Mr. Woolykneeze looks into his hat like a grown-up
genpleman; you can’t hear a fing."

"But," Edmund objected, "one hasn’t always got a hat in the morning,"
and opening Mr. Wycherly’s door a very little, he called through: "I
say, Guardie, do you always say your prayers into a hat?"

"Really, Edmund," said poor Mr. Wycherly, much perturbed by this second
interruption, "I do so dislike doors being opened while I am shaving,
especially when as in this instance——"

Edmund banged the door.

"I’m sure he doesn’t," he said confidently. "He can’t, for his hat’s
downstairs.  P’raps that Mr. What’s-is-name you mentioned has a special
kind."

"Mr. Woolykneeze has hundreds of hats," Herrick announced magnificently.

"What a lot of room they must take up," said Edmund, much impressed.

"They do," said Herrick, "rooms and rooms."

"Is yon Mr. Woolykneeze a relation?" Edmund asked.

Herrick looked thoughtful.  "Not exactly," she said slowly, "but he’s a
dear fend."

"How many pairs of trousers has he?"

Here was a poser.  Herrick was not yet very familiar with the science of
numbers.  "I’ve not seen them all," she said cautiously; "he wears
different ones every day.  Let’s come downstairs," she added quickly
lest he should ask more inconvenient questions.  "You may show me the
garden till bretfus is ready if you like."

By the time Mr. Wycherly came down, six places were laid for breakfast
and Mrs. Dew had cooked three extra portions of bacon and eggs.  She
rang the bell loudly and the boys with little Herrick came in from the
garden.

"Perhaps you’d better run along to the King’s Arms, Edmund, and tell my
nephew and his wife that breakfast is ready," said Mr. Wycherly. "I
thought, my dear," he added, turning towards Herrick, "that you said
your father and mother had come.  I hope they haven’t gone away in
despair because none of us were down."

Herrick looked up at him with candid, forget-me-not blue eyes.

"No," she said gravely, "I never said they’d come for they didn’t."

"But you did!" Montagu exclaimed.  "You said, ’We’ve all three come’
when you first came upstairs."

"So we have," she said.  "Mr. Woolykneeze and Umpy dear and me; not
mummy and daddie.  I ’spect this is him now," as a loud knock and ring
came at the front door.

And sure enough it was William Wycherly, so relieved to see his daughter
safe that he forgot altogether to scold her for running away.

Margaret, thinking her husband was in charge of Herrick, had not hurried
down and he, returning to the empty coffee-room, concluded that Herrick
had been fetched upstairs by her mother.  It was not till Margaret came
down that they discovered she had apparently vanished into space.
William instantly fell into a panic and was for summoning a detective at
once, when Margaret calmly interposed with the suggestion that he should
first look for his daughter in his uncle’s house.  After considerable
explanation which included the important personalities of Mr.
Woolykneeze and Umpy dear, William was fain to go back to the King’s
Arms without his daughter, and Herrick sat at Mr. Wycherly’s right hand,
raised high in her chair upon a dictionary and Cruden’s Concordance, and
had breakfast all over again "wivout a bib" as she joyfully announced.
The blue smock also bore testimony to that fact when the meal was over.
The extra bacon and eggs were not wasted; Montagu and Edmund consumed
the lot.

By the time breakfast was over it was nearly ten o’clock, and Edmund
went to the front door to look for Jane-Anne.  Sure enough she was there
waiting in a doorway just down the street. Jane-Anne saw him and came
out from her doorway, advancing rather timidly.

"Where’s Aunt Martha?" she whispered.

"Upstairs, making beds," Edmund answered, "so we can’t go to the attics,
but you can come into the garden.  There’s only one room looks out into
the garden and that’s Guardie’s study. He’s gone there now so Mrs. Dew
won’t be in that."

"Are you sure?" Jane-Anne whispered again. "She’d be awfully vexed if
she saw me."

"Come on.  That kid is here and she can’t stop long for we’re all going
out on the river. Hurry up if you really want to see her."

Jane-Anne came in sideways, as though by that means she made herself
less conspicuous.

Herrick and Montagu were standing on the lawn under an apple tree,
looking at some trumpet daffodils that were growing at its root.
Herrick, very gently, was lifting each yellow bell to look inside it.

"Fairies live in these," she was saying, "but it’s such a beautiful
morning, I ’spect they’ve all flown away.  You have to be very early to
catch a fairy.  Who’s that with Edmund and what’s she come for?"

"To see you, I think," Montagu replied. "Jane-Anne’s her name and she’s
Mrs. Dew’s niece."

Jane-Anne looked more haggard than ever this morning; pale to
ghastliness with dark shadows under her great eyes, she was singularly
unattractive.  Little Herrick felt both puzzled and repelled, but
Margaret’s teaching held good and the child walked forward holding out
her hand with a little gracious air that was very captivating.

"How do you do?" said Herrick.

To her surprise, this strange-looking person dropped on one knee before
her and taking the eggy little hand in both her own, kissed it.

"You’re quite right," Jane-Anne remarked to Montagu over her shoulder,
"she is like a princess."

"You may kiss me if you like," said Herrick graciously.

"If you please, miss, I’d rather you’d kiss me if you will," said
Jane-Anne humbly.  "I’d like to think anything so pretty as you had
kissed me."

There was something so wistful and pathetic in the pale face that gazed
so longingly into her own that little Herrick’s warm heart was touched
and she flung her arms round Jane-Anne’s neck and kissed her heartily.

"Thank you," said Jane-Anne as she rose up to her feet.  "I shall never
forget it, never."

"Now I," interposed Edmund, who had looked on with astounded
disapprobation at this display of sentiment, "I should loathe and
abominate anyone who kissed me and I should try to forget it as soon as
ever I could."

"So should I," Montagu agreed, "rather—but I suppose girls are
different."

"Course they are," Herrick chimed in; "quite different and much better
and more precious. Daddie says so."

This point of view did not appeal to the boys.

"I don’t know about ’precious,’" Edmund said scornfully.  "It depends
what you mean by precious."

"_I’m_ precious," Herrick explained, "very, very precious.  That’s why
they were so afraid they’d lost me this morning, ’cause I’m so
precious."

"I’m not," said Jane-Anne.  "Female orphans never are so far as I can
make out, but I’d like to be.  Oh, it would be lovelly!"

Herrick had been staring hard at Jane-Anne for some minutes and at last
could contain herself no longer.

"Why," she demanded, "do you wear such a funny hat?  Do you like it?"

"Why d’you wear no hat at all?" Montagu interposed, vaguely aware that
Herrick’s question was not tactful.

"I wear a bonnet generally," Herrick remarked with dignity, "but I came
out without it this morning ’cause they were in such a hurry.  D’you
like my smock?" she asked, turning to Jane-Anne.  "Mummy made it."

"I like everything about you," Jane-Anne answered, with commendable
enthusiasm.  "I think you’re a dear darling, and I hate all my clothes,
but I can’t go about without any because people would stare, beside it’s
generally too cold."  And though the sun was shining hot on the lawn,
Jane-Anne shivered.

Montagu looked at his watch.

"We’ll have to go and get ready," he said. "We’re all going on the river
this morning—they’re going away this afternoon—and I promised to take
her back to the hotel at half-past ten to have her face washed.  I wish
you were coming too," he added kindly, "but it’s not our party."

"Good-bye, little girl," said Herrick, "and I hope you’ll soon have a
nicer hat, a really pretty one."  And again Herrick kissed Jane-Anne.

"I’ll let you out at the garden door," said Edmund, "then we shan’t run
into Mrs. Dew."

Quite silently Jane-Anne followed him to the end of the garden where
there was a door in the wall.  It was seldom used and the key was stiff,
but by great efforts with both hands, Edmund managed to turn it.

"Come again, soon," he said hospitably, "and we’ll have some more
cricket."

Jane-Anne murmured something unintelligible and passed out with bent
head, the pie-dish effectually concealing her face.  Edmund locked the
door behind her and ran back to the house.

Outside the garden, in Saville Road, it was very quiet.  It is true
there was a distant rumble of carts from Holywell and a thrush was
singing in one of Mr. Wycherly’s apple-trees, but of human kind there
wasn’t a sign.

Jane-Anne went down on her knees, her shoulder pressed close against the
garden door.

"Dear God," she prayed, "I do so want to be precious too.  Please let me
be precious to somebody.  Please do."




                              *CHAPTER VI*

              *MR. WYCHERLY ADDS TO HIS RESPONSIBILITIES*

"Some cheeses are made o’ skim milk and some o’ new milk, and it’s no
matter what you call ’em, you may tell which is which by the look and
the smell."  _Adam Bede_.


Next day Mrs. Methuen took the boys out on the river for the whole
afternoon. She invited Mr. Wycherly to go too, but the previous day had
been his first experience of his wards as oarsmen, and he came to the
conclusion that he preferred their society on land.

He was sitting at his writing-table in his study.  The great oriel
window was open and he could see that there were already patches of pink
on the largest apple-tree, while the pear-trees had shed their snowy
blossoms and shone brilliantly green against the blue and cloudless sky.

It was a pleasant prospect from the study window: the long irregular
strip of garden, with smoothly shaven lawn in the centre and winding
paths among borders where vegetables, fruit and flowers grew side by
side in perfect amity.

The afternoon was singularly quiet, and, knowing Mr. Wycherly’s habits,
one would have felt that here was an excellent opportunity for his great
work on the Nikomachean ethics which had been sadly neglected during the
last strenuous weeks.  Yet he neither took up the pen nor did he open
any of the fat, calf-bound books piled one upon another at his elbow.

He sat very still, his long white hands resting idly on the arms of his
chair, his kind eyes dreamy, his whole attitude eloquent of contented
tranquillity.

Presently there came a modest tap at the study door, followed by the
entrance of Mrs. Dew with her small round tray, and on it a rather dirty
piece of paper which she presented to Mr. Wycherly with the
announcement: "A young person to see you, sir."

Mr. Wycherly, roused from his agreeable reverie, looked bewildered.

"A young person?" he repeated vaguely, "to see me.  What sort of a young
person, Mrs. Dew?"

Mrs. Dew’s face preserved the non-committal expression of one who has
seen service in really good families, as she replied: "A young woman,
sir, from the Registry Office, I should suppose."

Mr. Wycherly took the piece of paper off the tray and read as follows:

"_M. Fairfield exp.: general character six months twelve months plain
cooking age 23 very respectable._"

There were no stops.

He looked beseechingly at Mrs. Dew, but her eyes were bent upon the
carpet and she waited his pleasure a perfect monument of respectful
detachment.  Poor Mr. Wycherly had forgotten all about his search for
the accomplished general.  Somewhere in the back of his brain there
lurked the consciousness that Mrs. Dew was only a temporary blessing,
really there "to oblige Mrs. Methuen," till such time as a suitable and
permanent servant should be obtained; but she fitted into her niche so
perfectly, her sway was so benevolent, if a trifle despotic, that he
began to look upon her as part of the established order of things, and,
since his one visit to the High Class Registry Office, had made no
effort of any kind to find her successor.

"Couldn’t you see her for me, Mrs. Dew?" he entreated almost abjectly.
"You could judge of her capabilities far better than I can."

Mrs. Dew raised her eyes and looked Mr. Wycherly full in the face,
shaking her head the while: "No, sir, I think not, sir; it would be more
satisfactory for all parties if you was to see the young person
yourself."

Mr. Wycherly sighed heavily.  "Do you think she seems likely to be
suitable?"

Mrs. Dew’s wholesome, good-natured face once more became sphinx-like.
"I really couldn’t say, sir.  The appearance of the young women of the
present day is often very much against them.  We can only hope they’re
better servants than they look.  Shall I show her up here, sir?"

"Please, Mrs. Dew, but I do wish you could have interviewed her for
me—wait one moment.  Could you kindly suggest some of the questions I
ought to ask her?"

Mr. Wycherly’s voice betrayed his extreme perturbation and he swung
round in his revolving chair almost as though he had thoughts of laying
violent hands on Mrs. Dew to prevent her departure.

She paused on the threshold and an imaginative person might perhaps have
discovered a trace of pity in the glance she bent on Mr. Wycherly’s
agitated figure.

"The usual questions, sir, will, I should think, be quite sufficient."

And she shut the door behind her.

"The usual questions."

But what on earth were the usual questions? Mr. Wycherly could only
think of those in the church Catechism.  He picked up the dirty scrap of
paper and read it again.  "Exp." conveyed nothing to his mind.  They
were coming upstairs and he had no plan of campaign arranged.  He felt
absolutely forlorn and helpless. Suppose the young person didn’t go away
of her own accord?  How could he ever suggest to her that the interview
was at an end?  He found himself longing for the moral support of
Edmund, who at all events, never lacked the power of asking questions;
and no sort of young person, or, for the matter of that, old person
either, could inspire him with the unreasoning terror his guardian felt
at the prospect of the _tête-à-tête_ thus imminent.

Mrs. Dew opened the door.

"The young person," she announced, and her disapproving expression
changed to one of downright horror as Mr. Wycherly rose to his feet to
receive his visitor.

She was a short, stout young woman, dressed in a bright blue coat and
skirt of the shade known by drapers as "Royal."  Her hat was large and
was trimmed with tumbled pink roses. Her hair was frizzy and flamboyant
and her boots creaked—Mr. Wycherly thought to himself—infernally.

"Pray be seated," he said courteously.

The young woman selected a chair as far off as possible and giggled
affably.

"I understand," he began in a faint voice, "that you think you would be
able to undertake the duties of—er—thorough general servant—that I
believe is the correct term?"

"I always ’ave been general," the young woman replied, "though I did
think of betterin’ myself, but Mrs. Councer she said as yours was a
heasy place with no missus naggin’ at you an’ I thought it might suit me
so I come along to have a look at things.  It’s a largish ’ouse for one
but I suppose you don’t ’ave much cookin’ and waitin’."

"But there are three of us," Mr. Wycherly interposed eagerly.  "I’m
afraid that you would find it too much.  You are rather young to
undertake the entire management of this household.  You see there would
be the housekeeping to do—ordering, books to pay and so on, as well as
the actual work."

"Oh, I could do all that," she replied confidently.  "I’ll do the
shoppin’ meself.  I likes a run out between my reg’lar times, an’ I’d
see they didn’t cheat you in the books, puttin’ down things you’ve never
’ad."

Miss Fairfield smiled happily at Mr. Wycherly. She liked his looks.  She
was sure he would be easy to live with and probably would be unaware of
the existence of the followers.  In common with every woman ever brought
into personal relations with him, she was certain that he was in need of
protection from the others, and decided there and then that it was her
mission to see that he wasn’t put upon by anybody else.

"When will you be requirin’ my services?" she asked.

Mr. Wycherly gasped.  "I should require to consider the question," he
said feebly, "and it is usual, is it not, to give some——"

"My last mistress’ll give me a character.  I was there six months and
she almost went down on ’er knees for me to stop; but I couldn’t, it was
such an ’eavy place."

"Are you a good plain cook?" Mr. Wycherly asked, feeling here indeed was
a leading question; some of Lady Alicia’s instructions were gradually
recurring to his mind.  "Can you—er—do fish?"

"Fry fish, why bless you, sir, my last place was a fried-fish shop,
that’s why I left.  One gets tired of frying morning, noon and night. I
can do plain roast and boiled and milk puddin’s an’ that, but I don’t
profess to do pastry."

"Thank you," said Mr. Wycherly, and paused. To get rid of her, he was on
the point of saying that he would consider her qualifications and let
her know his decision later, when his delicate sense of honour pointed
out that such a course would not be quite straightforward dealing. She
was a terrible young woman and his fastidious soul revolted from the
very thought of the fried-fish shop, but she was young and she was a
woman; it would not be fair to let her depart with the impression that
she was a likely applicant when nothing on earth could induce him to
employ her.

"I fear," he added gently, "that you are not quite experienced enough
for us here, and therefore I will not trouble your late mistress with
inquiries.  I am sorry you should have had to come in vain—were you to
put any expense?"

The girl gave a short laugh.  "I’ve only come about half a mile," she
said.  "I’m sorry I don’t suit you; I think I could be very ’appy in
your situation."

Poor Mr. Wycherly looked most unhappy. He rose and rang the bell,
saying:

"Mrs. Dew will show you the way out."  He opened the door for her with
the gravest courtesy and she creaked downstairs, wondering why she had
not demanded at least "’arf a crownd" for expenses.  "I’d ’a’ got it
too," she thought to herself, "but it never entered me ’ead to say
nothin’ to ’im but the plain truth an’ ’im so civil and affable."

Mr. Wycherly went back to his chair and reached for a pamphlet dealing
with the philosophy of Eubulides, which he thought might be soothing,
but he had got no further than the statement that, "in Eubulides
positive faith was superseded by delight in his own subtlety," when
there came another knock at his door and again Mrs. Dew presented
herself.

"I beg your pardon, sir, for venturing to intrude upon you," Mrs. Dew
said respectfully, "but did you come to any arrangement with the young
person?"

Mr. Wycherly laid down Eubulides.  "Oh, dear, no," he groaned, "she was
quite impossible. A most well-meaning girl, I am sure—but——"

"I feared so, sir, from her very flashy appearance, but one always hopes
they may be better than their looks.  Being only temporary I should like
to know you’d found someone really suitable."

"Look here, Mrs. Dew," said Mr. Wycherly, suddenly taking heart of
grace.  "Why should you be only temporary?  Could you not settle down
with us?  If you find the work too much when my wards are at home why
not get a young girl to help you?"

"You’re very kind, sir," said Mrs. Dew, fingering her apron and looking
embarrassed, "but you see, I’m not without encumbrances. Husband I’ve
none, children I’ve none, but what I have got is a niece and my bits of
things. I’m bound to keep a little home for her in the holidays, that’s
why I can’t take a permanent situation.  You see, no one wants a child
of twelve tacked on to a servant for weeks at a time."

"But listen, Mrs. Dew, there is the cottage—the little cottage off the
kitchen where your bedroom is now—why not bring your things and furnish
it and the housekeeper’s room and there would be a home for your niece?"

Mrs. Dew turned very red.  "It’s most uncommon kind of you, sir," she
said, "but I shouldn’t like to take advantage of you.  You see, it’s
just when the young gentlemen would be at home her holidays come, and
perhaps——"

"That, surely, would be the very time when she could be of most use to
you."

Mrs. Dew looked queerly at Mr. Wycherly, then, as though forcing herself
to speak against her will, she said slowly: "You see, sir, I must be
straightforward with you.  If Jane-Anne was like some girls—like what I
was myself—I shouldn’t ’esitate to accept your very kind offer, for it
would make a great difference to me.  I hate choppin’ and changin’ and
if I may make so bold, sir, you need a staid person here to look after
things, but Jane-Anne’s the sort of child what crops up continual.  I
_couldn’t_ promise for ’er as she’d keep ’erself to ’erself like she
ought.  I’d do my best, sir, to keep her in our own part of the ’ouse,
but——"

Mrs. Dew paused and shook her head.  Whenever she was very much in
earnest she dropped into the speech of her youth; the aitchless,
broad-vowelled talk of the Cotswold country whence she came.

"But, I shall like to see your niece about the house," said Mr.
Wycherly.  "It will be pleasant to have a young girl growing up in our
midst, good for me and for the boys."

Again Mrs. Dew gave Mr. Wycherly that queer look, half-scornful,
half-admirative.

"You mustn’t think, sir, that there’s any real ’arm in Jane-Anne," she
said earnestly. "There’s nothing of the minx about her, I will say that;
but—I don’t know how to put it without being hard on the child, and yet
it wouldn’t be fair to you, sir, to let her come without telling you——"

Again Mrs. Dew paused and Mr. Wycherly looked rather anxious.

"She do make a sort of stir wherever she do go and that’s the long and
short of it."  And Mrs. Dew relapsed into broadest Gloucestershire again
as she blurted out this startling fact.

"Stir," Mr. Wycherly repeated, "stir.  Do you mean that she is a
particularly noisy child?"

"No, sir, not that.  Jane-Anne isn’t that; but she does things no other
child ever thinks of doing and you can’t seem to guard against it. The
very first month she was at the asylum, she went and put ’er foot
through a staircase window trying to see some soldiers as was passing.
They had a board meeting about it."

Mr. Wycherly laughed.  "It is unusual to put one’s foot through a
window, but surely that was an accident and not a moral offence?"

"It was a staircase window, as stretched all down one side of that
wing," Mrs. Dew said solemnly, "and the bannisters was up against it,
and Jane-Anne she leant over cranin’ ’er ’ead to see them soldiers, and
she lost ’er balance and swung back and drove ’er foot right through and
cut ’er leg so it bled dreadful."

"Poor child," said Mr. Wycherly, "that’s one thing she is quite safe
from here.  There will be no temptation for her to put her feet through
any windows.  Has she lost both her parents, Mrs. Dew?"

"That’s another thing," said Mrs. Dew, dropping her voice mysteriously,
"as I feel you ought to know, and that is, Jane-Anne’s father was a
Grecian."

"Really," Mr. Wycherly remarked, evidently quite unmoved by what Mrs.
Dew considered a most damaging fact.  "A Greek; how interesting! What
was his name?"

"Staff rides," Mrs. Dew answered promptly. "At least that’s what I call
it, but he called it something longer.  I’ve tried to English it as much
as possible to match her really respectable Christian name."

"Do you happen to remember how it was spelt?" Mr. Wycherly asked.

"Yes, sir, S-T-A-V-R-I-D-E-S."

"Ah," Mr. Wycherly exclaimed; "now I’ve got it.  Stavrides.  Quite a
common Greek name.  What part of Greece did he come from?"

"Athens, sir, an’ it was there he met my sister, who was lady’s maid to
Mrs. Methuen’s cousin.  She’d been schoolroom-maid first of all, then
when the young ladies grew up, they had her taught dressmaking and
hairdressin’ and took her everywhere with them.  And when Lady Lettice
married she took my sister Jane with her, and they travelled a lot, an’
in Athens there was a carriage accident and my sister was thrown out and
stunned, and this young man was passing and he picked her up, and it
seems he fell in love with her there and then, for all her eye was swole
up with the bump she got—she was a very-good-looking girl was
Jane—anyway, ’e never rested till ’e’d married ’er.  He was, I suppose,
in a rather better position than she was, though, from bein’ with the
young ladies so constant, my sister seemed to have caught their pretty
ways, and spoke exactly like them.  She wasn’t a bit like me," said Mrs.
Dew simply, "you’d never ’ave thought we was sisters."

"What was Stavrides?" Mr. Wycherly asked.

"A sort of writer, sir, for newspapers. When they got married he came to
London, and he was correspondent for some paper, some Grecian paper.  It
isn’t a trade I thinks much on, but he earned good money and he insured
his life heavy.  And then, just like him it was, he forgot to pay the
premium, fell ill and died all of a hurry when Jane-Anne was but
four-year-old, and my sister was left without anything at all but some
forty pounds they ’ad in the bank."

"Poor thing," said Mr. Wycherly.  "What did she do?"

"She did dressmaking, an’ she took a lodger. Lady Lettice an’ the young
ladies ’elped her all they could, and she was doin’ pretty well when she
took an’ died, an’ she left Jane-Anne to me.  My ’usban’ was alive
then—not as he was much use, an’ I’ve done my best, but you see, I’m
only a servant an’ not being out reg’lar makes it harder.  Lord Dursley,
he got her a nomination for the asylum at Baresgill, but I don’t know if
she can stop there.  It’s very cold up there in Northumberland, an’
she’s got a delicate chest.  She’ve been there fifteen months, but ’as
’ad a lot of illness, an’ I don’t know if she can keep on.  They don’t
like it, you see, sir, such a lot of illness."

"I understand it is some kind of an orphanage. The boys, you know, spoke
to me about your niece, Mrs. Dew.  I quite look forward to making her
acquaintance.  Do they receive any special training where she is?"

"Oh, yes, sir, it’s a most superior place where they train them for
young servants.  They get their education and their clothes and good,
thorough training in household duties, and when they’re seventeen they
put them out in good families that they know about, where they take an
interest in the servants and treat them well."

"It sounds an admirable institution," said Mr. Wycherly.  "Are the
children happy there?"

"Most of the girls, sir, are happy as birds. It’s a really good place,
sir, plenty of wholesome food, nice airy rooms—but there!  Jane-Anne she
frets something dreadful.  Sometimes I fear she’ll never make a good
dependable servant. If it’s book-learnin’, now, she’s on to it like a
cat on to a mouse.  There’s never no complaint there—but you never know
what flightiness Jane-Anne ’ll be after."

"You see," Mr. Wycherly said indulgently, "she is only a child as yet.
We must have patience.  Anyway, Mrs. Dew, I hope that is settled.  Send
for your furniture and for Jane-Anne——"

"I am deeply obliged to you, sir," Mrs. Dew said earnestly, "and I will
endeavour to serve you faithful.  I will arrange with Miss Morecraft,
her as I shares the ’ouse with, and I’ll fetch Jane-Anne most thankfully
when she can be moved——"

"Is she ill then?"

"She’s managed to get a most fearful cold on ’er chest; ’ow I can’t
conceive, but so it is; she’s that hoarse and croupy, Miss Morecraft’s
kep’ ’er in bed, and what I really came to ask, sir, was if I might pop
round after supper to see ’ow the child is."

"By all means, Mrs. Dew, and whenever she can be moved, bring her here.
Then you can look after her yourself."

Mr. Wycherly was very exhausted after this long conversation.  He lay
back in his chair and closed his eyes with a sense of well-earned
repose.  Whatever this child—this window-breaking, "cropping-up,"
generally disturbing little girl might be, she could not be one half so
dreadful as the sort of servant Mr. Wycherly saw himself a thrall to if
Mrs. Dew deserted him. Besides, Mrs. Dew, herself, would be there to
keep her in order.

"These domestic cares are very disorganising," he reflected.  He felt a
positive distaste for the Migrarian School of Philosophy just then. The
pamphlet on Eubulides lay open at his elbow, but he ignored it.
Instead, he went over to his book-case and took from it "Tristram
Shandy," which he dearly loved.  He opened it at random, standing where
he was, and his eyes fell on this passage:

"_’I can’t get out—I can’t get out,’ said the starling._

"_I stood looking at the bird; and to every person who came through the
passage, it ran fluttering to the side towards which they approached it,
with the same lamentation of its captivity.  ’I can’t get out,’ said the
starling.  ’God help thee!’ said I, ’but I’ll let thee out, cost what it
will.’_"

"I wonder now," Mr. Wycherly thought to himself, "if that poor little
half-Greek girl feels like Sterne’s starling."




                             *CHAPTER VII*

                       *JANE-ANNE SWEARS FEALTY*

"Minds lead each other in contrary directions, traverse each other in
numberless points, and at last greet each other at the journey’s end.
An old man and a child would talk together; and the old man be led on
his path and the child left thinking."  JOHN KEATS.


Jane-Anne had managed to get an exceedingly bad cold.  To run on wet
grass in stockings, if one wears the stockings all the evening
afterwards, is not a wise proceeding for a delicate person.  And when,
the next day, she went to keep her tryst with Edmund, she knew very well
that her lung was at its old tricks again; and that, had she been "at
the Bainbridge," matron would have sent for the doctor. He would have
listened at her back with his funny indiarubber tube, and would then
have muttered something mysterious about "crepitation."

Jane-Anne had her own idea of "crepitation," which she abbreviated to
"the creppits."  She always pictured this unfortunate lung as a bent and
aged person sidling along "with legs that went tap-lapperty like men
that fear to fall."

It was tiresome that lung; for whenever it began its tap-lapperty
entertainment she felt so ill.  Her head ached and her legs seemed to
weigh tons; her throat was hot and painful, and something seemed to
flutter in the palms of her hands like an imprisoned bird.

More dead than alive she crawled back from her meeting with the princess
to the stuffy little house "down in St. Clement’s" that her aunt shared
with Miss Morecraft, knowing full well that bed would be her portion
directly anyone noticed how ill she looked.

Miss Morecraft, a dressmaker of severely respectable and melancholy
temperament, was not observant, and it happened that just then she was
very busy, as her customers were nearly all servants, and a new dress at
Whitsuntide is a matter of sacred ritual in that class.

She did, it is true, remark that Jane-Anne was "a dainty feeder" when
the child left her dinner almost untasted, but she did not "hold with
pampering children," and having eaten her own dinner with considerable
relish, went back to her work, having pressed Jane-Anne into the service
to do some basting.

It was not till the child nearly fainted during the afternoon that Miss
Morecraft awoke to the fact that Jane-Anne was really ill.  She was
quite kind-hearted, and was rather shocked that she should have made the
child sew when she was evidently unfit for any effort of the kind. She
put her to bed, made her a cup of tea, and persuaded the milkman to call
and tell Mrs. Dew how matters were.

During the evening, Mrs. Dew "popped round," took Jane-Anne’s
temperature, rubbed her with liniment, scolded her well, kissed her and
tucked her up in bed, and left her unaccountably cheered and comforted.

Next morning a strange, new doctor came. He, too, listened at
Jane-Anne’s back with his funny double telephone.  He, too, shook his
head and murmured something about crepitation and congestion, just like
the doctor at "Bainbridge’s."

"Shall I be able to go back to school?" Jane-Anne croaked eagerly.  She
was hoarse as a raven.

"When does school begin?" asked the doctor.

"It starts on the 5th of May.  I have to go up on the 4th.  It’s such a
long way."

"And this is the 29th of April.  No, certainly you won’t.  You won’t be
fit for school for another fortnight, if then.  Are you sorry?"

"No," said Jane-Anne candidly, "_I_’m not sorry, but Aunt Martha’ll be
very sorry."

The doctor laughed.  "Well, you must do your best to get well, that’s
all; but it’s no use your going anywhere till that lung has ceased
crackling."

Miss Morecraft was far too busy to attend to Jane-Anne herself, and Mrs.
Dew, recklessly extravagant if there was real cause for anxiety where
her sister’s child was concerned, sent in a trained nurse.

The nurse did her duty by Jane-Anne, but considered the post rather
beneath her dignity, and was not interested in the fidgetty little girl
with the large eyes who sent up her temperature in an aggravating way by
getting excited over trifles.

One evening, when the temperature was once more normal, Mrs. Dew
informed Jane-Anne of her arrangement with Mr. Wycherly.

"Shall we really live there?  Will it be our very own home—not shared?"
the child demanded with incredulous delight.

"If there’s any sharing it’s Mr. Wycherly what shares his house with
us," said Mrs. Dew. "I’m to have the cottage for myself, and we get the
housekeeper’s room for a sitting-room."

"And I shall live in the house with those nice boys?" Jane-Anne went
on—"right in the same house."

"Yes," Mrs. Dew said; "but you must remember that you belong to the
kitchen part and there must be no trespassin’.  It would never do for
you to be playin’ with the young gentlemen like you was one of
theirselves.  You must understand that from the very first.  Not but
what they’re very kind young gentlemen, and have ast after you over and
over again, an’ Mr. Wycherly likewise.  Master Edmund, he wants to come
and see you before he goes back to school."

"Oh, Aunt Martha, do let him.  I should love it so.  I promise I won’t
go up, I’ll stay normal, I truly will."

"That I don’t believe for one minute, Jane-Anne; why, if I was to take
your temperature now—only I’m not going to—I know it’d be over a
hundred, with you so pink and all.  No, I don’t hold with Master Edmund
coming to see you here.  I’ve never been really wrop up in this
place—too many threads and snippets about for my fancy an’ a smell like
a draper’s shop all day long.  I’ve no wish as Master Edmund should see
you here—.  Now don’t you go cryin’ out before you’re hurt.  Wait till I
can tell you——"

"Oh, aunt, what—do be quick."

"The doctor says that seein’ the weather’s so good, you can be moved any
time now provided you go straight to bed when you get there——"

"And you’re going to move me—oh, Aunt Martha, how lovelly—to-day?"

"No, not to-day, but to-morrow, nurse’ll bring you in a fly.  And you
must promise to keep calm and not go bouncin’ and exclaimin’ and runnin’
up to a hundred over nothing at all."

"Aunt Martha, I’ll behave like a stucky-image," Jane-Anne protested.

"You’re more like a Jack-in-the-box than any image I’ve ever come
across, but I do think it’ll be better for me to have you where I can
see to your food my own self.  I don’t seem to have no faith in that
nurse’s beef-tea nor ’er arraroot—lumpy stuff what I saw.  An’ if you’re
to be got strong enough to go back to the Bainbridge in the next three
weeks (I don’t know how they ’ll take this fresh worriment) you must be
fed up.  So now you know.  You’re to get up for your tea and go back to
bed directly after, and you’re to keep quiet and not get into a fantique
nor go makin’ a palladum all about nothin’.  Do you hear me, Jane-Anne?"

"Yes, Aunt Martha, but I think fantiques and palladums must be lovelly
things; they sound so, and I long to make them, only I don’t know how."

"It strikes me it’s little else you’ll ever make. Now lie down in bed
for I must run.  Most considerate the master’s been, letting me come off
at all times to see you, and I hope you’ll remember it and try and make
yourself useful when you get about again.  Good-bye, child, and we
shan’t be separated much longer for which I thank the Lord as made us
both."

It marked a change in Mrs. Dew’s attitude towards the household in
Holywell that she spoke of Mr. Wycherly as "the master."  It suggested a
permanence in their relations which would have been very reassuring to
him had he heard it.  Jane-Anne, too, noticed the phrase, and when her
aunt was gone gleefully repeated to herself:

    "See-saw Margery Daw,
      Jenny shall have a new master,
    She shall have but a penny a day
      Because she can work no faster."


"It’s not Jenny really, it’s Johnny, but Jenny does as well, and I’ll
work without the penny," thought Jane-Anne, "if only that beautiful old
gentleman will be my master too."

Edmund had elected to take his guardian for a walk before tea, and led
him over Magdalen bridge, out into the Cowley Road, and finally into
Jeune Street.

"Why are you taking me this way?" Mr. Wycherly asked.  "It does not
appear to me to be a particularly agreeable neighbourhood."

"It isn’t," Edmund frankly agreed, "but now we’re here we may as well
look in and see Jane-Anne; she’s to sit up a bit this afternoon, Mrs.
Dew said so, and she said I needn’t trouble to go and see her because
she’s coming to us to-morrow, but I think we ought to go, you know,
especially as we’re here.  You haven’t seen her, and she’ll like coming
better if she’s seen you."

"Edmund," said Mr. Wycherly, stopping in the middle of the road,
"acknowledge that you have brought me here with the deliberate intention
of visiting Mrs. Dew’s niece."

"Well, Guardie, I _did_ think of it.  Don’t you think it’s the proper
thing to do?"

By this time they had reached the door, whereupon Edmund knocked loudly
without waiting for further discussion.

Miss Morecraft was much flustered.

"Yes, they could see the little girl if they didn’t mind coming
upstairs.  She had just been got up and the nurse had gone out for a
breath of fresh air.  Very warm for the time of year wasn’t it."

Miss Morecraft opened the bedroom door, and without any announcement
squeezed herself against the outer wall that Mr. Wycherly might enter.

Jane-Anne was seated in an armchair at the window looking frail as a
sigh.  She wore a bright pink flannelette dressing-gown which
accentuated her pallor.  She loved this garment dearly, for dressing
growns were not included in the uniform of "The Bainbridge."  Most of
the girls were far too strong and healthy to need them, and Mrs. Dew had
made this for Jane-Anne during one of her many illnesses.

Mr. Wycherly stood in the narrow doorway and the afternoon sun shone in
on him, on his silvery hair and gentle, high-bred face.

"May we come in, my dear?" he asked. "Do you feel well enough to see
us?"

Poor Jane-Anne was too weak to stand up and curtsey.  She flushed and
paled, and paled and flushed as she turned her thin, sensitive little
face towards Mr. Wycherly, but there was no mistaking the welcome in her
great eyes, as she whispered: "Please do, sir, I’m so sorry I mayn’t get
up and put a chair for you."

"I’ll get him a chair," said Edmund, pushing in under his guardian’s
arm, for the door was very narrow.  "I thought I’d show him to you
before you came to-morrow, then you won’t feel strange with any of us."

There wasn’t much room in that bedroom. The bed took up most of the
floor and there was only one other chair besides Jane-Anne’s, so Edmund
sat on the end of the bed.

"You must make haste and get strong," Mr. Wycherly said kindly, "and if
this fine weather goes on you’ll be able to sit in the garden and get
plenty of fresh air that way!  And when you are able we must see about a
little drive. That ought to be good for you."

"Oh!" exclaimed Jane-Anne.  "Oh!  I don’t know how I shall wait till
to-morrow, I want to come so much."

"Let’s get a cab and take her now," Edmund suggested; "it would be a
lark, and such a surprise for Mrs. Dew."

Jane-Anne looked from Edmund to Mr. Wycherly, but saw that the
enchanting proposition found no favour in his eyes.

"We mustn’t do that," he said, "we haven’t got the doctor’s permission,
and I don’t think Mrs. Dew has got her room ready yet."

"This bed’s coming for me to-morrow," Jane-Anne said shyly.  "The things
in this room are Aunt’s."

"You won’t be such a squash in the room you’re going to have," Edmund
remarked. "It’s not a big room but you’ll be able to get round the
furniture better."

"It will be so lovelly to have a little room of my own," Jane-Anne said
softly.

"I hope you will sleep well in it, and get strong," said Mr. Wycherly.
"And I am sure Mrs. Dew will make it as pretty for you as possible.  And
now, my child, we must go.  I don’t think you are very fit for visitors
as yet, and we mustn’t tire you.  We just looked in to tell you how
welcome you will be to-morrow."

"We’ve got a bathroom, you know," Edmund said proudly, anxious to do the
honours of their house.  "Hot and cold and a squirty thing for washing
your head, you can use it for the rest of you, too, if you like, but it
makes rather a mess.  It’s in the basin really, and we do each other
sometimes.  I do like a bathroom, don’t you?"

Jane-Anne murmured her appreciation of that luxury, and Mr. Wycherly
held out his hand to her, and she gave him hers; such a nervous little
hand, so thin and hectic and fluttering: yet it grew still as it lay in
his, and there seemed some subtle contact in its gentle clasp.

The child’s eyes and the old man’s met in a long gaze that asked and
promised much.

The eager, hungry little face grew a thought dim to Mr. Wycherly, it was
so wistful and so wan.  Instead of good-bye, he said, "God bless you, my
child, God bless you," and went out of the room rather quickly.

Edmund’s farewells were longer, and Mr. Wycherly waited patiently for
him in the sunny street.  He had gone out so quietly that Miss Morecraft
never heard him.

She heard Edmund, though, and hastened to the door to speed the parting
guest.

Jane-Anne, faint with rapture, lay crumpled up in her chair.

"He looked at me," she whispered, "he looked at me just like he looked
at him that night when I peeped through the window—just every bit as
kind.

    "See-saw Margery Daw,
    Jenny has got a new master."




                             *CHAPTER VIII*

                     *JANE-ANNE ASSISTS PROVIDENCE*

    "To be sick is to enjoy monarchial
    Prerogatives." _Elia_.


The doctor was Mrs. Methuen’s doctor, and she had told him something of
Mrs. Dew and his little patient; of how that worthy woman had given up
place after place in the last five years that she might keep "an ’ome"
for her orphaned niece; of how Jane-Anne was born in Athens and brought
to London when she was a baby; of the modest, beautiful lady’s maid, her
mother, and the brilliant irresponsible young journalist, her father, so
that he felt a kindly interest in his excitable little patient, and was
sympathetically glad that "an ’ome" had been found for aunt and niece
that seemed to promise rooted comfort and stability for both of them.

Therefore, when, on the morning fixed for Jane-Anne’s removal to
Holywell, he came to sanction or forbid that removal, he refrained from
taking her temperature and said that the child could go.

Whereupon Jane-Anne’s strength was increased tenfold, so that when she
was dressed she walked across the room by herself, and sat in a chair by
the window while the nurse packed her yellow tin trunk.

Then came the great, the tremendous moment when the fly stood before the
door, and the strong young nurse carried her downstairs and placed her
in it, with a cushion for her back and a rug sent by Mr. Wycherly over
her knees.

The drive passed like a brilliant dream.  The men were up and the busy
streets were full of bustling life and youthful jollity.  Jane-Anne sat
forward in her seat, the wavering colour vivid in her cheeks, and even
the inverted pie-dish could not wholly shadow the bright gaiety of her
eyes.  All too soon it was over and they stopped before the archway in
Holywell where Mrs. Dew was waiting to help her niece in at the
side-door.

It seemed a little hard to be hustled up to her aunt’s room and there
and then undressed and put to bed—a tame ending to so thrilling an
experience; but once between the sheets Jane-Anne discovered that she
was unaccountably and extraordinarily tired.  She meekly drank the egg
beaten up in warm milk that her aunt brought her, lay back on the
pillow, and at once fell fast asleep.

Since term began Edmund had been exceedingly busy.  Never before had he
seen so many young men gathered together.

Hitherto his acquaintance had lain almost exclusively among elderly
persons or boys of his own age.  To be sure there were two youngish
masters at his preparatory school, but the mere fact that they were
masters set them on a distant and undesirable plane for Edmund.

But now young men, young men were all around him: in the houses
opposite, on the pavements, in the hitherto so stately and silent
quadrangles, on the river, in the playing fields.

One night as he lay in bed Edmund had heard a great many cabs plying up
and down Holywell, and in the morning this transformation had come to
pass.  The tide of youthful life flooded every corner.  Even the grave
grey buildings seemed to open sleepy eyes and laugh and wink at one
another in enjoyment of this resistless torrent, and all the inherent
sociability in Edmund’s nature gushed forth to join and mingle in the
jocund stream.

Before three days had passed he had friends in half a dozen colleges.
His method of procedure was quite simple.  He sallied forth without
Montagu, who was shy and exclusive and would have died rather than
address a stranger without legitimate cause, and selecting an apparently
amiable and manifestly idle youth, asked him the way somewhere in
broadest Doric.  On two occasions he happened to hit upon a
fellow-countryman, and directly he discovered this he spoke in an
ordinary way, and they were friends at once.  He generally explained
exhaustively who he was and whence he came, where he lived and the
resources of the establishment in Holywell, and his new-found friends
evidently found his conversation amusing, for they neither snubbed nor
checked his garrulity.

On the day of Jane-Anne’s arrival he had been out all the morning
finding his way about Oxford by the means indicated, and only returned
just as Mrs. Dew was laying luncheon.

"Is Jane-Anne not coming till afternoon?" he asked.

"Jane-Anne’s here, Master Edmund, been here these two hours."

"Here! and we’ve never been told nor seen her.  Where is she?"

"Sound asleep in my bed, she’s that weak—but I don’t believe moving
her’s done her a bit of harm, she’s sleeping like a baby and looks that
contented——"

"Can we go and look at her?" asked Montagu.

"No, sir, please, sir, I’d rather she slep’ as long as she can.  She’s
not slep’ much this last week an’ I shall let her be till she wakes."

"Will you tell us whenever she wakes?" Edmund persisted.  "You see, we
go back to school in two days now so we shan’t see very much of her,
’specially if we don’t begin at once."

"You young gentlemen had better keep on with your own doin’s and never
mind Jane-Anne. She’s got to go to school, too—soon as she’s well
enough," said Mrs. Dew primly. She set the last spoon and fork
symmetrically in their places and went back to the kitchen to dish up
lunch.

Edmund looked across at Montagu.  "I shall stop in this afternoon, and
I’m going to see Jane-Anne," he whispered obstinately; "she’s in our
house."

"So’m I," said Montagu with brief decision.

The bed and "bits of furniture" came from Jeune Street in the afternoon,
and the noise of the men carrying things up the uncarpeted stairs woke
Jane-Anne, who lay for a minute staring at the unfamiliar room and
wondering where she was.

It was a fairly large room with a wide latticed window that overlooked
the stone-cutter’s yard, for the cottage was to the side of the house
and its three windows looked that way.  Clean muslin curtains hung at
the window, so that Jane-Anne couldn’t see out except when they moved
with the breeze.  The ceiling was low and an oak beam crossed it.  Most
of the rooms in the main part of the house were panelled, but here they
were papered, and the paper was of a cheerful chintzy pattern with
garlands of little pink roses.

The furniture was all of brightly polished mahogany that had been in
Elsa’s room at Remote, and it had that characteristic individual look
only to be found in old furniture well tended by careful hands through
many years.

The Chippendale Talboys had a scroll top with a pedestal in the centre,
and on that pedestal was a little brass owl.  The handles had lost their
lacquer with time, but the warm red wood was mirror-like in its
brightness, and in the great "press"—a cupboard in two divisions with
deep sliding shelves—Jane-Anne watched the reflection of the fluttering
curtain with sleepy satisfaction.

She had no idea why she liked these things so much better than the
painted wood that furnished the bedroom in Jeune Street, but she did
like them amazingly, and their presence filled her with such
satisfaction as caused her for a little while to forget how exceedingly
hungry she was.

Presently the door was opened a little way and a fair curly head was
poked through cautiously.  Jane-Anne was lying with her back to the
door, and all that was visible of her was a night of black hair
streaming over the quilt and a long slender mound in the bed where her
body lay.  She was so still that Edmund thought she was asleep, and was
going away again when something, some tiny sound, caused her to turn
round, and she saw him.

Edmund vanished like a flash and she heard his stentorian voice
proclaiming: "She’s awake, Mrs. Dew; you can bring that chicken."

Then he returned, and nodding at her in most friendly fashion seated
himself at the end of the bed, remarking:

"What an awful lot of hair you’ve got; isn’t it frightfully hot?"

"I can never keep the ribbons on it in bed. I don’t mind it.  I rather
like to be hot."

The two stared at each other, and Edmund decided that Jane-Anne looked
nicer in bed than when she was up.  The soft, shadowy masses of her hair
were infinitely more becoming than the pie-dish.  Her forehead was
smooth and placid.  There was no deep wrinkle between her black
eyebrows.

"I’m glad you’re here," said Edmund genially; "but it’s a pity you’re in
bed.  You might have done some more fielding if you’d been up."

"I’m very sorry I can’t run after balls for you, sir," Jane-Anne said
meekly, "but I can’t be sorry I’m in bed, for if I wasn’t I’d be going
back to the Bainbridge almost at once, and now doctor says I can’t go
for another fortnight."

"And you’re glad not to go?  Why?"

"Because——" said Jane-Anne; but at this moment Mrs. Dew appeared with a
tray.  She swept Edmund out of the room, plumped up the invalid’s
pillows, got her into a bed-jacket, and then stood over her while, with
the best will in the world, Jane-Anne did full justice to her dinner.

"What a pretty room this is, Aunt Martha," she said when she had eaten
the last spoonful of pudding.  "What is it makes it so pretty?"

"The things in it is all good," Mrs. Dew replied, "all old and good; not
at all what’s suited to a servant’s bedroom, if you ask me.  But they
was here when I came, an’, of course, it isn’t for me to find fault.
The other things has come, and I’ve got them arranged, but the carpet
couldn’t be nailed down for fear of waking you.  They look very
different in a good-sized room to what they did in Jeune Street, I can
tell you.  I’m very pleased to see my own things what I’m used to.  You
shall have this room, Jane-Anne, while you’re here.  I’ll move my
clothes to-morrow and put yours in.  If it isn’t Master Edmund again,
and Master Montagu with ’im—I never knew such perseverin’ young
varmints, an’ the times I’ve sent them away.  One’d think you was some
sort of a exhibition, that one would.  Yes, sirs, you may come in, but
you mustn’t stop long.  One’d think as you’d never seen a sick person
before, an’ me not had time so much as to wash her face before you was
back again.  What!  Mr. Wycherly wants to come and see her after tea?
Well, it’s a great honour, and very kind on his part after going
yesterday and all."

This time the interview was brief and unsatisfactory, for Mrs. Dew
remained in the room and Montagu, in consequence, was absolutely dumb,
while Jane-Anne was too nervous to do more than mumble negatives or
affirmatives to the innumerable questions asked by the quite
unembarrassed Edmund.

After five minutes of it the boys departed of their own accord.

Jane-Anne slept again from lunch till tea time, and after tea Mr.
Wycherly came to see her.

This time Mrs. Dew did not remain.  She set a chair for him and left
them.  Jane-Anne was sitting up in bed, arrayed in a white dimity jacket
of Mrs. Dew’s.  This garment was voluminous and much too large for its
wearer, so that Jane-Anne’s face and hair seemed to emerge from amidst a
billowy sea of dimity.  Her hair was still loose and streamed over the
bed. Mrs. Dew had wanted to plait it up, but Jane-Anne said the thick
plaits hurt her head when she lay down, so her aunt gave way.

"You are looking better, my child," said Mr. Wycherly.

"I am better, sir; I’m nearly well, I’m afraid."

"Afraid! but surely you want to be well?"

"I should if I was going to stay here," Jane-Anne said earnestly.  "Sir,
do you think you could stop me going back to the Bainbridge?"

"Stop you," Mr. Wycherly repeated, much perplexed.  "But I thought——"

"I’m sure," Jane-Anne interrupted eagerly, "if it’s to learn to be a
servant that I’ve got to go back, Aunt could teach me just as
well—better, I think.  She can do everything they do there, and do it
nicer than the people that teaches us.  She is a good servant, isn’t
she, sir?"

"Your aunt is a quite admirable person," Mr. Wycherly said gravely, "and
most accomplished in every household art; but from what she told me I
gathered that this school is a very good one, and that it was a great
help to her to have got you into it."

Jane-Anne’s eager face blanched.  "Please, sir," she whispered, "if I
promise to eat very little and work very hard would you let me stay with
you and aunt?"  She clasped her hands and leant forward, devouring Mr.
Wycherly’s face with her great tragic eyes.  "Aunt would be very angry
if she knew I’d spoken to you; but you could stop me going if you liked,
and if I go back, I shall die, I know I shall."

"What is it you dislike so much?" Mr. Wycherly asked.

"All of it, except the lessons, they are lovelly. I can’t seem to do it;
my back aches so, and it’s so cold."

"But it won’t be cold this time.  Summer is almost here."

"It isn’t the weather, it’s my heart," cried Jane-Anne; "it’s that
that’s so cold.  Nobody cares much about me, they think me odd and
funny.  Do you think me odd and funny, sir?"

Mr. Wycherly certainly did, but he laid one of his beautiful old hands
on Jane-Anne’s, saying gently, "I think that as yet you are not very
strong, and I am quite sure that it is bad for you to worry about going
back.  You can’t possibly go back for another fortnight, your aunt said
so, and—who knows——?"

Mr. Wycherly had not intended to say this last at all.  It was most
unwise and misleading, but the brown eyes held his and compelled him to
give them comfort.  He tried to patch up his mistake by saying, in a
matter of fact tone: "Suppose Montagu or Edmund begged me not to send
him back to school, what should I do?  Because, you see, I know that
school is the best place for them—though for me the sun sets and never
rises till they come back.  We all have to do things we don’t like."

"But they like school—they told me so."

"You probably would like it, too, if you made up your mind to do so."

"I’ve tried so hard, sir.  I really have.  Your young gentlemen don’t
have to wear horrid clothes at their school; you don’t know how dismal
it is.  I believe if I might live here with you and aunt I’d never have
the creppits any more; I’d be so warm and happy in my heart."

"Well, you must keep on being warm and happy, and get strong and
merry—and then—we’ll see what can be done."

Oh, weak, soft-hearted Mr. Wycherly!  Against his will, against his
better judgment, the words slipped out.

Jane-Anne, white but radiant, lay back exhausted on her pillows.  Mr.
Wycherly stood up to go.  "Promise me," he said, "that you won’t worry,
that you will eat and sleep as much as you can, that you will do
everything that your good aunt and the doctor bid you, and that you will
try to be happy and at home."

Jane-Anne sat forward again.  "Mr. Wycherly, sir," she said
breathlessly, "you won’t forget, you will try and make aunt keep me? Oh,
I have cried and cried, and prayed and prayed, and I don’t think God can
expect much more of a little girl like me, do you?"

"Crying is absolutely forbidden.  You must promise me that you won’t cry
any more."

"I promise," she said meekly, and lay back on her pillows again.  "But
you, too; you won’t forget?"

"I certainly shall not forget.  Now I must really go."

He had reached the door, when an imperative cry from the bed stopped
him.

"You haven’t said it."

"Said what?" and Mr. Wycherly trembled lest she should force him to
swear then and there that she should not go back to the Bainbridge.

"What you said yesterday afternoon.  Please say it, and then perhaps He
will."

"God bless you, my child," Mr. Wycherly mumbled, much embarrassed.

As he made his way through the housekeeper’s room to his own part of the
house he reflected that Mrs. Dew was certainly right when she described
her niece as "making a stir."  She had assuredly stirred his heart to a
quite painful extent.  He was moved and perturbed and puzzled as he had
not been for many a long day, and through all his pondering there
sounded Sterne’s words to the imprisoned starling: "_’God help thee—but
I’ll let thee out, cost what it will.’_"




                              *CHAPTER IX*

                              *THE QUEST*

    "My voice shall with thy future visions blend,
    And reach into thy heart, when mine is cold,
    A token and a tone...." _Childe Harold_.


Next day Jane-Anne was allowed to sit in the garden under the
apple-tree: a queer little hunched-up figure in the tight stuff-dress
and a shawl.  She also wore the pie-dish, for Mrs. Dew was one of those
people who considered it almost disreputable to be out of doors
bare-headed.

She sat in a basket-chair and on her knees lay her most recent prize,
"Home Influence," a fat handsome volume bound in purple cloth with gilt
edges.  For lessons, Jane-Anne had won every prize open to her at the
asylum. Although she had only been there a year, and that year
constantly broken by long bouts of illness, she had gained seven books.
These, which included a Bible, a prayer-book, and church hymnal, with
one other comprised her whole library.  The prizes were all of a moral
and edifying character, and Jane-Anne had read them over and over again
hungrily, with the passionate interest and enthusiasm which she brought
to everything outside her actual daily duties.  And although she
whole-heartedly admired them she was yet subconsciously critical and
unsatisfied.  She regarded her prizes with the greatest respect.
Familiarity had, so far, bred no contempt for them in her mind, but all
the time she felt that there was something lacking.  Although they were
the only books she possessed, they were not the only ones she had read.
In the previous autumn, her mother’s mistress, Lady Dursley, had
commanded her aunt to take the child for a change to their place in
Gloucestershire, accompanying the order with a liberal cheque for
travelling expenses. The family was in Scotland and most of the big
house shut up, and nearly all the servants were making holiday, except
the housekeeper, an old friend of Mrs. Dew, and one elderly
kitchen-maid. But the great library was open, for a young man had been
sent down to catalogue the books.  He was an intelligent young man and
took a fancy to Jane-Anne and had her with him a great deal.  He found
her books he thought good for her, and on departure presented her with
the little green-covered "Children’s Treasury," compiled by Palgrave.

In this Jane-Anne read constantly and carefully, not because she was
particularly attracted by the poems, though some of them she loved and
learned by heart, but because whenever she came across any poetry she
searched through it eagerly in the hope of finding a poem her father
used to repeat to her.  She had read and re-read the little green book
unceasingly, but nowhere could she find her poem.

Her father died before she was five years old, but Jane-Anne’s
recollection of him was curiously vivid, and at this very moment her
mind strove to materialise a memory elusive in some ways as a puff of
smoke, sharp and defined in others as a tongue of leaping flame against
a midnight sky.

The moment Mrs. Dew had safely disappeared into the house the child
dragged off the pie-dish and cast it violently on the grass at her feet.
Then she lay back in her chair, her eyes dreamy and pensive, though ever
and again she knit her black eyebrows in her effort to remember.

Her thin hands lay folded above the unopened volume on her knees and she
sat very still.

It was warm and pleasant in Mr. Wycherly’s garden; a thrush sang in the
boughs above her head, and every now and then pink and white petals
dropped softly upon her hair.  A flutter of wind blew over a great clump
of narcissus bearing their perfume on its wings, and the heavy scent was
memory-laden for Jane-Anne.

She saw a long, low-ceiled, lamp-lit room with a window at either end
and all the furniture ranged round the walls that a free path might be
open for the restless pacing up and down of one who was never too busy
or too absorbed to be at the beck and call of an often fretful little
girl. As in a vision she beheld that man "with all his keen worn look
and Grecian grace" tramping to and fro and holding in his arms a tired,
fidgetty child who could not sleep.

Backwards and forwards he went, and with the soothing movement was the
sound of words sorrowful and majestic, musical in their rhythmic swing
and balance: words that poor Jane-Anne could never remember though she
felt that they were written indelibly on mind and heart but covered,
covered deeply with layer upon layer of fugitive things of little worth.
Some day, she was convinced, she would find that poetry and with it a
thousand things about her father that she had forgotten.  He often wore
a narcissus in his button-hole, and as her head lay on his shoulder the
crushed flower gave forth a double fragrance.

It was this familiar scent, strong in the warm old Oxford garden, that
seemed to compass her about in an atmosphere of memories, memories of a
time when she, too, was always warm, cared about, schemed for, enwheel’d
around with love on every hand.

The lines between the black eyebrows were smoothed out as by a tender
hand.  The unremembered poem ceased to worry her.  She would find it
some day.  Meanwhile, she was sure her daddy knew she loved him.  There
was something he had told her to remember and she had forgotten, but
only for a little while.  It would come back, she was sure it would come
back.  Here, in this house, where there were so many books, perhaps she
would find it.

She saw again her beautiful, gentle mother, so calm always and patient.
Mrs. Dew was careful to impress upon Jane-Anne that she in no way
resembled her mother, and the child never resented this reproach, for
had not that very mother rejoiced in her likeness to her father?  "My
little Maid of Athens," had been her mother’s name for Jane-Anne, and
Jane-Anne treasured it in her mind.  She knew that her worthy aunt had
never either liked or approved of her father, and this only made her
more passionately loyal to his memory.  She pondered these things in her
heart, puzzled and pained sometimes, but never daunted in her pride.  It
was from no mean country that her father had come, she was sure of that.
She knew little enough of Greece, nothing of its great history, but
chance phrases that she had heard in infancy remained in her mind.  She
was sure that there was something to know, something worth knowing, and
that she would know it some day.

She never spoke of her parents to her companions at the asylum; and
although Mrs. Dew would often talk fondly and proudly of her mother and
Jane-Anne loved her for it, her aunt’s silence with regard to the father
she adored filled the child with a resentment none the less bitter that
it never found expression. Jane-Anne was perfectly aware of her hostile
attitude, although Mrs. Dew was careful never to say one word in
disparagement of a man she had been quite unable to understand; whom she
had heartily disliked.

"I wonder why I’m thinking so much of my daddie since I came here?"
Jane-Anne thought to herself.  "I suppose it’s because I’m happier."

Presently, over the grass towards her came Montagu, very long in the leg
and short in the sleeve.  Edmund was out zestfully finding his way about
Oxford in his recently discovered fashion.

Montagu sat down on the grass at Jane-Anne’s feet and looked up at her,
smiling broadly, but never a word said he till he espied the book in her
lap.

"What’s that?" he asked.

"One of my prizes, sir," Jane-Anne answered primly.

"Is it decent?"

"It’s most interesting."

"Can I look at it?"

The book changed hands and Montagu began to read.  He turned the pages
very fast, to the wonderment of Jane-Anne, who had never seen people
read after this fashion.

He was lying face-downwards on the grass in front of her, and she
watched his eyes as they swept the page from top to bottom in,
apparently, one glance.  She liked his thin brown face with the large
kind eyes and firm capable mouth that was always shut when he wasn’t
talking, but just at that moment she thought that his expression was
less pleasant than usual, that there was something scornful and almost
sinister about his mouth, and yet she was sure that in some queer way he
was amused.  Why?

Jane-Anne had never found anything in the least amusing in the work in
question; interesting, certainly; "touching" (the lady who gave them
Sunday lessons at the asylum was fond of the word "touching")
frequently; but humorous never.  The authorities who chose books for
female orphans at the Bainbridge did not consider the cultivation of a
sense of humour in any way a necessary part of the training.

Presently Montagu began to dip into the book here and there, still
reading with that lightning-like rapidity that so astonished Jane-Anne.

In five minutes he shut it with a slam and looked up at her and laughed.

"What awful rot," he remarked genially, as though certain of sympathy.

Jane-Anne gazed at him in consternation. "Rot?" she faltered.

"Fearful squish; you don’t mean to say you really like it?"

"I don’t know what you mean," she said, so offended that she quite
forgot the respectful "sir."

"It’s so stilted and bombastic and unnatural. The style"—here Montagu
unconsciously gave a perfect imitation of his house master’s manner—"is
so cheap and meretricious."

"I don’t understand about style in books," said Jane-Anne, still much
umbraged.  "D’you mean the binding?"

"Good gracious, no.  I mean the way it’s written.  Listen to this"—and
Montagu opened the book haphazard and read the following extract
aloud:—"’He had been minister of a favourite church in one of the
southern towns, and master of an establishment for youths of high rank,
in both which capacities he had given universal satisfaction.  The
reprehensible conduct of some of his pupils, carried on at first so
secretly as to elude his knowledge, at length became so notorious as to
demand examination.  He had at first refused all credence, but when
proved by the confused replies of all, and half-confession of some, he
briefly and emphatically laid before them the enormity of their conduct,
and declared, that as confidence was entirely broken between them, he
would resign the honour of their education, refusing to admit them any
longer as members of his establishment.’  There!" Montagu exclaimed,
"could you have anything worse?"

"I think it’s all said very properly and grandly," Jane-Anne protested.
"I don’t see what’s the matter with it at all."

Montagu rolled over on the grass and sat up.  "It’s the grandness that’s
so detestable."

"It’s my best prize," she said indignantly.

"I’m sorry," said Montagu, seeing that she was really hurt, "but you ask
Guardie about that sort of writing."

"It’s printed," snapped Jane-Anne.

Montagu gazed at her in hopeless bewilderment. He had never before
argued with a girl.

Her cheeks were flushed and her eyes filled with angry tears.  She
clenched her thin little hands and bit her lips to keep from bursting
into sobs.

"I say," Montagu exclaimed, with real contrition, "why do you mind?
What does it matter what I think?"

"If you," Jane-Anne gasped, "had as few books as me, and loved them
every one dearly, and then someone came along and abused them and called
them ’rot’ and ’merry something’ and ’squish,’ _you_ wouldn’t like it."

This time the big tears escaped, rolled over and down her cheeks,
dropping with a splash on to the plaid shawl covering her knees.

And at this critical moment Mr. Wycherly came out of the house and
across the grass towards them.  He had seen the children from his study
window, and remembering that the boys went back to school next day,
decided to seek their society under the pleasant shade of the
apple-tree.

Montagu stalked over to the tool house to fetch a chair for his guardian
and arrived with it as Mr. Wycherly reached the apple-tree. Jane-Anne
had lost her handkerchief, the tears were shining on her cheeks, and she
gave a most unmistakable sniff just as Mr. Wycherly reached them.  But
she stood up and curtsied with downcast eyes and burning cheeks, and at
the same moment Montagu came back bearing a chair for his guardian.

"What is the matter?" asked Mr. Wycherly.

Jane-Anne continued to stand, and lifted her tear-washed eyes to his
face.  Had it been stern or severe she could never have answered a word;
as it was, she said quite simply: "He didn’t like my prize and I
minded."

Mr. Wycherly sat down in the chair Montagu had brought and looked from
the pained and indignant Jane-Anne to the evidently puzzled and
distressed Montagu.

"Suppose we all sit down and try to come to a better understanding," he
said.

Jane-Anne sank heavily into her chair.  She was still weak, and even the
little effort to greet Mr. Wycherly with due respect caused her legs to
quake and her heart to beat thunderously in her ears.

She leant her head against the back of the chair and looked so white
that for a moment Mr. Wycherly thought she was about to faint. But she
did nothing of the kind.

Instead, she said in a voice that wholly belied her exhausted
appearance: "Have you read ’Home Influence,’ sir?"

"I don’t think so," said Mr. Wycherly; "is that the name of the book
under discussion?"

Jane-Anne held it out towards him; he took it from her carefully, placed
his eye-glasses on his nose, opened it haphazard, and began to read.

Precisely the same thing happened as with Montagu.  His eyes sought a
page and he turned it.  This extraordinary way of reading was not
peculiar to Montagu, that was evident. But in Mr. Wycherly’s face
neither scorn nor amusement was portrayed, only a polite interest.

In three minutes Montagu said, "Well?"

Mr. Wycherly closed the book.  "I cannot," he said, "be expected to
express an opinion after so cursory a glance at the contents. Montagu,
go and ask Mrs. Dew for a glass of milk; this child looks faint; bring
some biscuits, too."

Montagu sped away, and he turned to Jane-Anne.

"You mustn’t mind him," he said kindly. "Clever Winchester boys are
always intolerant—while they are boys.  Montagu reads a great deal more
than he can digest, and people with indigestion are proverbially
cantankerous."

Jane-Anne didn’t understand what he meant in the very least, but she
felt immediately and immensely comforted.  So much so, that she was
impelled to speak to Mr. Wycherly of her thoughts when she first came
out.

"Please, sir," she said, calmly dismissing the merits or demerits of
"Home Influence" that seemed so vital a moment ago.  "Do you know a
piece of poetry about mountains?"

"A great deal of poetry has been written about mountains," Mr. Wycherly
replied cautiously.

"It’s a piece of poetry I want to find," said Jane-Anne, "that I heard
many times long ago, and I can’t remember anything about it except that
there was mountains.  I thought perhaps you’d know it."

Here Montagu appeared with a glass of milk and some biscuits.  The milk
had slopped over on to the biscuits "in some unaccountable way," he
explained; but their sopped condition did not spoil them for Jane-Anne,
who munched quite happily and smiled her broad ecstatic smile at him to
show that she had forgiven his cruel remarks about "Home Influence."

Presently the doctor came to see her, and Mrs. Dew fetched her in to be
sounded.

The moment she had gone Montagu turned upon his guardian, demanding
sternly: "Well, isn’t it hopeless squish?"

"It is her prize," said Mr. Wycherly gently.

"Why, that’s just what she said," Montagu exclaimed in astonishment at
his usually logical guardian taking this line.

"You will find," said Mr. Wycherly, "as you go through life that it is
never safe to abuse things violently before you have realised your
hearer’s point of view.  You may offend deeply."

"You’d have to be jolly dishonest to always think of that," Montagu
answered indignantly.

"You will be jolly rude and disagreeable if you never think of it," Mr.
Wycherly retorted. "Besides, did she ask you for your opinion?"

"Well, no—but it seemed such a pity to go on liking such stuff.  People
must begin to learn what’s good and what’s bad sometime—and I shouldn’t
think she’s stupid."

"I am quite sure she is not stupid, and I am equally sure that she is
painfully sensitive and that you were more than a little stupid not to
see it."

"Me, stupid!" Montagu repeated in surprise. "No one has ever called me
that before."

Mr. Wycherly chuckled.  "I thought," said he, "that the presence of a
young girl among us would be mentally stimulating.  She has not been in
the house two days and yet, you see, already she has suggested to you
new possibilities in yourself.  By the way—just make a note of any poems
you can think of bearing on mountains."

"Why, there are thousands," cried Montagu, aghast.

"Sure to be in Wordsworth," said Mr. Wycherly. "Anyway, we’ll mark the
places."

    Long ago and fur away."
      RUDYARD KIPLING.


The boys had been back at school a fortnight.  Jane-Anne was quite
convalescent and got up to breakfast, but the date of her return to the
Bainbridge was still undecided.

The doctor came at longer intervals, but every time he came he still
declared that there was "a roughness" in Jane-Anne’s lung, and that it
would be madness to send her North until that roughness was smoothed
away.

Night and morning and many times during the day, Jane-Anne bombarded
heaven with petitions that "the roughness" might perhaps increase a very
little, since it gave her no inconvenience whatever; anyway, that it
might remain sufficiently rasping to confirm the doctor in his view that
her return to the Bainbridge was at present out of the question.

Mrs. Dew, although properly respectful to the doctor as a friend of Mrs.
Methuen, yet felt that in this case he pushed professional caution to
the verge of the ridiculous.  Here was Jane-Anne eating and sleeping as
well as could be, with pinker and plumper cheeks than she had had for
many a long day, looking, in fact, as her aunt said, "the picture of
health," though some people might have thought the picture rather
elusive and misleading; here was Jane-Anne eating the bread of idleness
with almost aggressive satisfaction in Holywell when she ought to have
been reaping the benefits of her "nomination" up in Northumberland.

Why all this fuss about a slight roughness? "Mark my words and anyone
can ’ear anything as he listens for," said Mrs. Dew.

Finally, Mr. Wycherly interviewed the doctor, who said to him in plain
words what he had feared to say to the child’s aunt.

The doctor was an outspoken young man of sporting tendencies.  He wore a
white hat rather on one side and drove an uncommonly good horse, and to
Mr. Wycherly he said: "It’s like setting a thoroughbred filly to pull a
cart-load of bricks to expect that child to do housework in her present
state.  She ought to do nothing for three months, and even then I should
say she is singularly unfitted for the kind of life she has up there.  I
know those schools—excellent for big strong girls; but that child isn’t
strong.  She’s all nerves and brains and empty, craving heart.  The lung
trouble isn’t serious if it’s checked in time, but if she goes back
she’ll get overtired and catch cold again directly. I’m sorry for her
aunt, but what can I say?  I won’t be responsible for sending her back."

The doctor spoke angrily.  He hated interfering in other people’s
business and he thought it exceedingly probable that an old gentleman
living by himself might strongly object to having a girl child foisted
upon him for an indefinite period.

"It seems to me," said Mr. Wycherly mildly, "that it would be criminal
stupidity to allow her to go back."

The doctor looked rather astonished.

"But what’s to become of the child?" he asked.

"Surely there is nothing to prevent her remaining here with her aunt,
and when she is strong enough are there not good schools in Oxford?"

The doctor picked up his white hat.  "Of course," he said, "if you have
no objection to her remaining here the whole thing is perfectly simple,
but I understood from her aunt that the arrangement was the child was
only to be here in her holidays, and she seemed sadly afraid of
trespassing upon your good-nature in keeping her here so long as it is.
She’s a very decent, honest woman, but——"

Mr. Wycherly rose and rang the bell to summon Mrs. Dew.


And the end of it all was that somebody wrote to Lord Dursley.
Jane-Anne’s "nomination" at the Bainbridge was presented to a girl whose
physique was more deserving, and his lordship, instead of being annoyed,
as Mrs. Dew had feared, at Jane-Anne’s failure to benefit from his good
intentions on her behalf, declared himself quite ready to pay for her
"schooling" in Oxford whenever that fidgetty fellow, the doctor, should
consider her able for instruction.

"Not till the autumn," said the doctor, to Mrs. Dew.  "She can help you
till then, you won’t overwork her, I’m sure."

Jane-Anne knew perfectly well that her fate hung in the balance when the
doctor sought his interview with Mr. Wycherly, and when the result of
that interview was imparted to her rather grudgingly, and with many
injunctions as to decorous conduct, by her aunt, she felt such a
passionate love and gratitude towards the gentle-mannered master who had
made this beatific state of things possible that she could not rest that
night without going to thank him.

Therefore, without consulting her aunt, she sought his study after
dinner and knocked timidly at the door.

Mr. Wycherly was, as usual, seated at his desk writing; the shaded light
was pulled low over his papers, making a little pool of brightness in
the grey dusk of the room.  The big window was wide open and a scent of
wallflowers was wafted in from the garden below.

"Come in, my child, come in," said the kind, welcoming voice as he saw
the timid figure at the door.

And Jane-Anne came in with a nervous rush, but she did not forget to
shut the door behind her.

She dropped on her knees beside him and seized his hand, kissing it
passionately, much to his confusion.  He was quite unaccustomed to
violent manifestations of feeling, and his long residence in Scotland
had increased his natural reserve.

"I know it’s you who managed that I shouldn’t go back, and I do want so
to thank you. You don’t know what I feel like.  Please, sir, I will try
to be useful.  Anything you would like me to do——"

Very gently Mr. Wycherly withdrew his hand. "Suppose you sit on a
chair," he suggested, "and we will have a chat together."

With stately courtesy, he placed a chair for Jane-Anne, and, seated
again in his own revolving-chair, turned to face her.

As always, when much moved, she was very white, and to-night her great
eyes were soft and dog-like in their devotion.

"By the way," said Mr. Wycherly, "I haven’t forgotten your inquiry about
the poem that you cannot remember, and I have marked in a volume of
Wordsworth a number of verses dealing with mountains.  Perhaps you would
like to look through it at your leisure."

"Thank you, sir," Jane-Anne whispered.

"I know nothing," Mr. Wycherly continued, "more annoying than a
half-remembered quotation. I sincerely hope that you will soon find it."

For a moment there was silence, then:

"Sir," Jane-Anne said earnestly, "are you very lonely now the young
gentlemen have gone back to school?"

"I do miss them greatly of course."

"Do you remember, sir, when you came to see me, when I was in bed the
first day I was here, you said when they went back that the sun set for
you——"

"Did I?" said Mr. Wycherly, rather surprised at himself.

"You really did, sir, and I wondered whether—though the sun has
set—whether you’d let me try—to be a little tiny star—just so you
wouldn’t feel quite so lonely."

Mr. Wycherly’s hand still tingled with the touch of those soft
unaccustomed girlish lips, nevertheless he held it out to her, saying,
"That will be very kind of you."

Jane-Anne placed her own within it and she did not attempt to kiss Mr.
Wycherly’s hand again, but she looked at him as though she would read
his very soul and asked: "Sir, have you ever heard anything about a
place called Greece?"

Mr. Wycherly laughed.  "For a considerable portion of my life," he
replied, "I have heard about little else."

"Will you tell me things sometimes, sir? Will you?"

"I shall be most happy," said Mr. Wycherly. "You certainly ought to know
as much as possible about your father’s country—and there is so much to
know."

"I have another name," she said suddenly and with apparent irrelevance.
"Shall I tell it you?  Very few people know."

"Do you mean Stavrides?" Mr. Wycherly asked.

"No, sir, not that; I have another Christian name.  Allegra; don’t you
think it’s very pretty?"

"Very," said Mr. Wycherly; "it is a beautiful name, but it isn’t Greek."

"I’m called after somebody’s daughter that died.  I don’t know who she
was; mother knew.  My daddie liked the name.  I daresay I shall find out
some day all about her."

"I daresay you will," said Mr. Wycherly, and looked hard at Jane-Anne.

"Which would you like to call me?" she asked.

"I shall call you Jane-Anne, not Allegra," Mr. Wycherly said decidedly.

"It’s a pretty name," she said wistfully.

"It has rather sad associations for me," he added.

The clock upon the mantelpiece struck nine. Jane-Anne rose.  "I must go,
sir, now; good night, and thank you."

"Good night, my child.  Get strong and rest you merry.  And here is the
Wordsworth; tell me when you find your poem."

She took from him a large brown volume that bristled with inserted slips
of paper.  He crossed the room and opened the door for her, and
Jane-Anne went out with her head held high.  "Just like he did for Mrs.
Methuen," she reflected ecstatically.

When she had gone Mr. Wycherly went and stood at the window and looked
out into the night.  The sky was unclouded, of a deep, soft, soothing
blue, and right in a line with his window shone one star.

"I wonder," he pondered, "what made him call her after Byron’s
daughter."

When Jane-Anne reached the kitchen, proudly bearing her volume of
Wordsworth, she found her aunt sitting at the newly scrubbed kitchen
table darning a stocking.

"What made you stop so long for?" Mrs. Dew inquired tartly, "hindering
and worritin’ the master.  It don’t take half an hour to say ’thank you,
and my duty to you.’"

"The master set a chair for me and talked to me," Jane-Anne replied
gloriously, "and when I came away he opened the door for me, just like
he did for Mrs. Methuen when she came the other day, and he’s lent me a
great big poetry book.  Look at it!  Oh, aunt, I do believe the Almighty
must be just like Mr. Wycherly."

Mrs. Dew nearly dropped her stocking. "Jane-Anne!" she exclaimed in
tones of horrified amazement, "how you can stand there and say such
things passes me.  Go to bed this minute, you inyuman child.  You ought
to be ashamed of yourself, that you ought."

"But, aunt," Jane-Anne expostulated, "Miss Stukely, the lady that taught
us Sundays, she said we must love God, be always loving Him, and always
talking about Him; we couldn’t think and talk too much about Him; the
more we did it the fitter we’d be for heaven, and I’ve never seen
anybody before as I’d like Him to be like—so where’s the harm?"

The child spoke with breathless earnestness.

Mrs. Dew stared at her, intensely disapproving.

"How you can stand there," she repeated; "how you can have the face to
stand there and talk about the Almighty bein’ _like_ anybody, just as if
He was your next door neighbour, turns me cold.  Where’s your respect?
Where’s your sense of decency?  I’ll have none of your revival ways
here, I can tell you; quiet, respectable church I’ve always been, with
none of such goin’s on.  It’s quite enough for most of us to do our duty
in that station of life without talking familiarly of lovin’ and such.
_Go_ to bed, I tell you, and let me hear no more of such fandanglements,
and I’ll come in ten minutes to fetch your candle and bring you that hot
milk as is all over skin you’ve been so long.  Now bustle about
smartish."

Jane-Anne bustled.

Mrs. Dew leant back in her chair as one quite unable to cope with the
force of circumstances.

"My stars!  Good fathers!" exclaimed Mrs. Dew. "If that’s the sort of
thing they teaches at the Bainbridge it’s more than time my niece was
took away."

Very early next morning Jane-Anne crept out of bed, pulled up her blind,
and seized the volume of poetry Mr. Wycherly had lent her. She read till
her eyes ached and her head swam; she read without the smallest
understanding or enjoyment, but with the greatest care and application,
and though there was much about mountains there was nothing that struck
the faintest chord of memory in Jane-Anne.  Whatever it was that her
father had repeated when he used to carry her about, it wasn’t there.
And yet she was certain about "the mountains."  Yes, it was "the
mountains."

"I’m afraid he’ll have to look again," she said to herself.  She had not
the smallest doubt that Mr. Wycherly would help her.

It was a very hot May, and as the doctor had said she could not be too
much in the fresh air, her aunt, that afternoon, put a little table and
chair for her under the apple-tree, gave her some needle-work, and
bidding her listen for any bell that might happen to ring, announced her
intention of going out to do some household shopping.  "Unless anyone
calls to see the master it’s unlikely that anyone’ll come at all," said
Mrs. Dew, "and the front door bell’s that loud you’ll hear it right
enough if so be as you don’t get moonin’.  I shan’t be more than a
hour."

Shortly after Mrs. Dew’s departure Mr. Wycherly came to his window and
looked out.

There sat Jane-Anne at the little table covered by a heap of white
sewing, and he thought what a pleasant picture she made in her stiff
buff frock, so maidenly and sweet, so suitably and sensibly employed on
this sunny afternoon in the midst of the green old garden, gay with
tulips and fragrant wallflowers.

Suddenly Jane-Anne stooped down and took off her heavy shoes and there
and then flung them one after another to the other side of the lawn.
Then she removed her stockings. Mr. Wycherly gazed fascinated.  What was
the child about?

This was soon deplorably evident.

Jane-Anne was taking off her dress.

Mr. Wycherly felt that he ought to go away from that window, but he
didn’t.  He stayed where he was and, what’s more, he placed his
eyeglasses upon his nose.

She gave herself a complicated kind of shake and the buff abomination
fell about her feet in stiff expostulating folds.

Daintily and deliberately, she stepped out of it as though withdrawing
her feet from something dirty and distasteful.  She wore a skimpy little
blue-and-white striped petticoat of cotton; body and skirt in one piece
it reached just to her knees, but was sleeveless, and her long, slender
arms were bare.

A thrush was singing in the apple-tree and a blackbird warbled loudly in
a lilac bush trying to drown the thrush.  They sang as though there were
no such thing as winter in the world, and neither of them cared a whit
for Jane-Anne and her disrobings.

Flinging her white arms above her head, she danced into the middle of
the lawn on slim, twinkling white feet and continued to dance all over
it with the greatest abandon and enjoyment, while her long black plaits
bumped joyously.  So light of foot, so variously graceful in her
gracious suppleness, with such divine gravity and dainty decorum that
Mr. Wycherly watching was fain to take his glasses off and wipe them,
for suddenly he could not see as clearly as he wished.  Her radiant face
was pale, but her wide eyes were full of a gladness that seemed to
mirror back the brightness of that May afternoon, and the little
petticoat was like the sheath of a flower enfolding and displaying all
this happy grace.

Loudly carolled the blackbird, lustily chirruped the thrush, and
Jane-Anne danced to their orchestra, and while she danced her mind kept
saying: "I’ve done with it; I’ve done with it.  I shall never go back.
Life is before me, a new life; a life full of wonders, and a bedroom to
myself, with furniture like looking-glasses; a life with a kind,
sensible, if worldly minded aunt, who gives to little girls delicious
puddings that they like.  A life with books in it, big books; not
interesting, perhaps, but very grand and splendid to have lent one.  A
life that is to be lived under the same roof with a beautiful, kind old
gentleman who will perhaps, by-and-bye, let me wait upon him.  Oh,
wonderful and delicious prospect, to wait upon Mr. Wycherly!  To hand
him his plate and to pour out—what should she pour out? Wine, she
expected, though Miss Stukely said wine was wrong.  Not, perhaps, for
the gentry, for the _real_ gentry, as her aunt would say.  How soft and
warm the grass to the bare tripping feet!  How kind of those birds to
sing like that!  How lovely it was to be young and light and to have got
rid of heavy shoes and hot, uncomfortable frock.  How——"

It was the front door bell.

Jane-Anne heard it and Mr. Wycherly did not.

There certainly was the making of a quick-change artist in Jane-Anne.
In a twinkling she had found her shoes and stockings and put them on,
and she ran to the house struggling into her dress as she ran.

    "You have the Pyrrhic dance as yet,
    Where has the Pyrrhic phalanx gone?"

said Mr. Wycherly, wondering why she had stopped so suddenly.




                              *CHAPTER XI*

                          *THE CULT OF BRUEY*

"The instinct of imitation is implanted in man from childhood, one
difference between him and other animals being that he is the most
imitative of living creatures." _Poetics_, ARISTOTLE.


Jane-Anne was a true Athenian in that she was ever ready to run after
any new thing, and during her last two terms at the Bainbridge the
strongest influence in her life was that of her Sunday-school teacher,
Miss Stukely.

Jane-Anne whole-heartedly admired Miss Stukely, and where she admired
she invariably imitated.  Miss Stukely was delicate, and Jane-Anne
delighted in her own "crepitations" as being the sincerest sort of
flattery of that lady.

Miss Stukely was slender, always elaborately dressed, gentle in manner,
with white, heavily ringed hands.  She was not, perhaps, beautiful in
face, being somewhat sallow with a receding chin; but her expression was
kindly, and Jane-Anne read into her face the spiritual excellencies the
lady was most fond of extolling. She had a way of closing her eyes when
she was most earnest in exhortation that Jane-Anne found very
impressive.  Moreover, she frequently used a gold-topped smelling
bottle, and the possession of a similar restorative was just then
Jane-Anne’s most cherished aspiration.

To lean back in a chair while inhaling the vinegary fragrance of a
cut-glass bottle, to lean back with closed eyes, in an aura of the
faintness and exhaustion induced by strong emotion, was to Jane-Anne as
the ecstatic vision of a mystic: a state of mind and body only to be
attained by profound spiritual exaltation.

She learned by heart with ease.  She could reel off any number of
appropriate, or quite as often, inappropriate texts; and did so on the
smallest provocation, greatly to the indignation of Mrs. Dew, who felt
that she required no religious instruction at her niece’s hands.

This facility greatly impressed Miss Stukely, who felt that in Jane-Anne
she indeed found fertile soil for the good seed, and there was no
question whatever that Jane-Anne fully deserved the prize she gained for
"Bible-searching."

This prize was the history of one "Bruey," "a little worker for Christ,"
whose winning personality (Miss Stukely was fond of the word "winning,"
generally using it in the sense of a successful gainer of souls) seized
upon Jane-Anne’s imagination till she lived and walked and had her being
in that character.

Bruey was just her own age, had "great dark eyes" (Jane-Anne was
pleasantly conscious of possessing similar orbs), had palpitations.
Jane-Anne couldn’t quite achieve these, but felt that crepitations were
nearly as good and that she was, at all events, near the rose, if not
the royal flower herself.

Bruey had no father (another resemblance) and a mother, who, though an
industrious church-worker, was perhaps not quite as understanding and
sympathetic as she might have been.  Put Mrs. Dew in place of the mother
and there you are!

Bruey always read her Bible seated upon a box in her bedroom window; "a
folded rug upon this box made it soft and comfortable for a seat."  Here
she studied the scriptures and said her prayers, watching the sunset the
while. She always kept a pencil by her and marked the texts she found
most helpful, and Jane-Anne’s Bible already was scored heavily in
hundreds of places.  Its newness (being a prize) was rather afflicting,
so she wetted her thumb and doubled down the corners to hasten its look
of age and constant use.

The box and the window were denied to Jane-Anne at the Bainbridge, for
twelve girls slept in a dormitory where the ledges of the windows were
five feet from the ground, and no box of any sort was permitted in an
apartment of almost superhuman neatness.

At Jeune Street, too, the room was so small that the window was blocked
up by a chest of drawers far too heavy for Jane-Anne to move.

But the moment she came to Holywell she perceived glorious possibilities
of Bruey-ness in the fine big bedroom her aunt had given up to her.  It
is true that the dressing-table stood in the window, but it was an
old-fashioned, spindle-legged affair with swing looking-glass attached,
quite light and easy to move, and the moment that Jane-Anne could get
about without assistance she pulled it back into the room, dragged her
empty tin box under the window, and having no shawl, folded her
dressing-gown on the top to make it "soft and comfortable for a seat."

As a matter of fact it did nothing of the kind, the box was dinted and
lumpy and very hard, but what cared Jane-Anne?  Bruey’s box was covered
with chintz, but that, she felt, was a very minor detail.  The main
properties were all there—box, window, Bible, little girl.

That the window did not face towards the west was disappointing; that
very little sky was to be seen owing to the presence of a tall house
just across the yard was rather annoying. Still, there was the box and
there was the window, and there was Jane-Anne, ready to throw herself
into the part of Bruey with the utmost abandon.

She even improved upon Bruey, grafting on to the character certain
attributes of Miss Stukely.

That morning, Mrs. Dew had turned out the kitchen cupboard, and among
discarded bottles and boxes Jane-Anne had found a tiny phial that had
contained vanilla essence.  This she secretly pocketed.  She tore a
piece off her sponge, thrust it into the little bottle and then hied her
to the bath-room where there was some Scrubbs’ Ammonia.  In a trice the
bits of sponge in the bottle were saturated with that pungent fluid.
Behold Jane-Anne equipped with a smelling bottle, quite as efficacious
if not so handsome as Miss Stukely’s.

She sought her bower at seven o’clock, while her aunt was safely engaged
in the final preparations for Mr. Wycherly’s dinner.  She had no time
for reading and meditation at bed-time, for Mrs. Dew always came to take
away the candle.  Her aunt mistrusted Jane-Anne ever since she had set
her hair on fire one evening in Jeune Street.  When she reached her room
she found that her box had been put back in the corner and her
dressing-gown was hanging behind the door.  This constantly happened.

Jane-Anne muttered something that sounded like "interfering old thing"
and hastened to arrange it all again.  This didn’t take long, and once
the stage was set she mounted the box, and gazed out into the
uninspiring stone-cutter’s yard with a suitable expression of "winning
tenderness."  Next she closed her eyes wearily and distantly inhaled the
Scrubbs’ Ammonia in the vanilla bottle.  It restored her and she opened
her Bible haphazard with a sanctimonious Jack-Horner sort of expression
on her thin, eager little face.

She opened at the book of Job.

Now this was unexplored country.  Genesis she knew; Kings and
Chronicles, and the greater part of the New Testament she had read.  But
somehow the book of Job hadn’t entered into Miss Stukely’s scheme of
salvation, and Jane-Anne’s only acquaintance with Job so far had been in
her aunt’s phrase, "you’d try the patience of Job," and she had vaguely
pictured him as a meek old gentleman tormented by a large family of
unruly children.

Montagu and Mr. Wycherly had dipped into "Home Influence" anywhere.
This was a new way of reading to her, and she felt she must at once do
likewise.  So into the end of the book of Job she thrust and started at
the words, "Canst thou bind the sweet influences of the Pleiades or
loose the bonds of Orion," and read on aloud.

Now, there was in Jane-Anne a fine feeling for the beautiful and she
liked the sound of it greatly, her voice growing stronger and more
impressive as she read.  Especially was she carried away by the
description of the horse: "_He paweth in the valley and rejoiceth in his
strength; he goeth on to meet the armed men.... He swalloweth the ground
with fierceness and rage: neither believeth he that it is the sound of
the trumpet.  He saith among the trumpets, Ha, ha; and he smelleth the
battle afar off, the thunder of the captains and the shouting._"

By this time, quite unconsciously, she had raised her voice very
considerably, and she stopped in great confusion as her aunt bounced
into the room demanding anxiously: "What ever is the matter?  Who’re you
a-calling out to?"

"I’m only reading to myself," Jane-Anne mumbled.

"Well, I wish you’d read a bit quieter," said Mrs. Dew, "frightening a
body to death with ’ha-ha-in’s’ and sech.  An’ what are you doin’
sitting on that there box as I put away this very afternoon?  Why can’t
you leave it be in the corner?"

Jane-Anne made no reply.  It is disconcerting to be snatched suddenly
from all the exciting panoply of a battle-field to a mere discussion as
to the position of boxes.  She felt bewildered and unreal.

"Why don’t you answer me?" Mrs. Dew asked impatiently.

"I was reading," Jane-Anne repeated stupidly.

"An’ a very bad light to read in," said Mrs. Dew.  "You come down into
the kitchen an’ give me a hand with the master’s dinner instead of
sittin’ hollerin’ there, and you put back that box in its proper place."

While Jane-Anne was washing up she remembered with contrition that she
had not marked a single text.

In two particulars only did she feel that she could never hope to
emulate Bruey.  Firstly, because Bruey died in the last chapter of her
palpitations.  Now nothing was more opposed to Jane-Anne’s aims than
that she should succumb to her crepitations.  Secondly, she felt that
she could not hope even to approach Bruey’s noble self-abnegation in the
matter of hats.

Bruey at first taught her Sunday class wearing a beautiful best hat
adorned with roses; but on a senior teacher pointing out that this
embellishment might have a bad effect upon the morals of her infant
scholars, she begged her mother to remove the offending garniture and
replace it by a simple ribbon.

Never, Jane-Anne was assured, could she attain to such heights of
self-denial.  She never had possessed a hat with roses, but if she ever
did—not all the Sunday-school teachers in creation should wrest them
from her.  On that point her determination was rooted.  She would follow
Bruey in all else but death-beds and hats. At present she felt that her
hat would not excite any emotion save loathing in no matter how
frivolous a breast.  But if ever the day came—after all, Miss Stukely
had hydrangeas in her hat—and there was no need to model herself
slavishly on Bruey.

Much as she loved Mr. Wycherly, he caused her some heart-searching.  She
adored him. To her, he seemed to combine in his own person every kind
and gracious and beautiful quality; but so far he had not said any "good
words" to her except that twice he had murmured, "God bless you."  Not
one text had he quoted when they spake together, nor had he asked her
any of those searching intimate questions as to her spiritual condition,
that she found so exciting and so wonderfully easy to answer
satisfactorily.

She had the true mystic’s sense of nearness to the unseen; and in giving
to the lonely child this feeling of fellowship with the saints, this
serene confidence in Heaven’s interference in her affairs, Miss Stukely
and Bruey, between them, had bestowed on her a real and precious gift.

But they had also created a mental pose. They had imbued her with a
sense of pious security that armed her against endeavour.  What she did
easily she did well.  What she disliked and found difficult she did not
try to do at all, and any unpleasantness resulting from such inactivity
she looked upon as a "cross."  So long as she was meek and patient under
rebuke; so long as she turned the other cheek to the smiter and bore no
malice, she felt that she had done all that could be expected of her.

For instance, in the matter of the box, it seemed absolutely vital to
her that she should read her Bible and meditate in Bruey’s fashion no
matter how the constant disturbance of the said box annoyed her aunt.

As she wiped plates in a smeary and perfunctory fashion, she was
rejoicing in the existence of Montagu and Edmund, because Bruey had a
cousin Percy whom she influenced for good. There was a Percy, too, in
"Home Influence," and like all the Percies in that class of fiction,
these two were dashing, full of generous impulses, but easily led
astray.  Bruey’s Percy even read yellow-backed novels in bed at night,
and Jane wondered whether Montagu was given to similar nocturnal orgies.
She had no more idea of what a yellow-back was than she had of a Roman
Catholic, but she was sure that both were equally pernicious.

Edmund fitted more easily into the Percy part, he was so merry and
good-looking; but fond as she was of the centre of the stage, Jane-Anne
could not yet quite see herself enlightening Edmund in the approved
Bruey fashion.

He was so unexpected, he would be certain to say the wrong thing.

At this moment Mrs. Dew came back from the dining-room.  "You’re to go
and see the master in his study," she said; "it’s a quarter to nine now,
and the minute the clock strikes you’re to come."

Jane-Anne flew to the sink to wash her hands and hastened upstairs,
buttoning her sleeves as she went.

"Well, have you found the poem?" asked Mr. Wycherly.

"No, sir.  I’ve read every one you marked, but it isn’t one of them."

"Curious," Mr. Wycherly said thoughtfully; "we must try again.  Sit
down, my child, and think if you can remember in what sort of metre it
was written, that would be a help."

But Jane-Anne knew nothing about metre, so the question of the poem
lapsed for the time being.

The precious moments were fleeting, and Bruey being still in the
ascendant, she asked _apropos_ of nothing:

"Please, sir, do you think Master Montagu and Edmund are little
workers?"

"Edmund certainly isn’t," Mr. Wycherly replied decidedly; "he’s an idle
young dog"—here he chuckled—"but all the same he can do whatever he sets
himself to do.  Montagu, on the contrary, is naturally industrious.  He
loves knowledge for its own sake.  Why do you ask?" and Mr. Wycherly
looked inquiringly at Jane-Anne.

She was mystified.  That anybody should call anybody else "an idle young
dog" in that tone of affectionate amusement was in itself most puzzling.

"I suppose," she said, deliberately paraphrasing a favourite remark of
Miss Stukely’s, "we can all be workers, ’you in your small corner; I in
mine.’"

"Quite so," Mr. Wycherly assented politely, though he in his turn was
somewhat staggered by Jane-Anne’s gently patronising tone.  Had the
Greek nymph of the afternoon turned into an amazing little prig in the
evening?  It was evident that this child was a quick-change artist in
more than the matter of make-up.

As for Jane-Anne, she felt curiously flattened out.  This courteous,
kindly old gentleman made her feel incredibly small.  Bruey, she was
certain, or even the apostolic Miss Stukely herself, would find it
exceedingly difficult to approach Mr. Wycherly on the subject of his
soul.  And then and there was lighted in the youthful mind of Jane-Anne
one little candle of common-sense which illuminated this dark and
difficult situation with the bright suggestion that possibly Mr.
Wycherly’s soul was Mr. Wycherly’s business and not hers; and just at
that very crucial moment she heard him saying:

"By the way, child, isn’t that dress rather hot and heavy for this
summer weather?  Don’t you think we’d better see about something else if
you’ve not got anything thinner?"

She jumped to her feet, clasping and unclasping her hands in an agony of
earnestness. Where frocks were concerned souls had a poor chance with
Jane-Anne.

"Oh, sir," she cried, "it’s a hateful old dress, but my two cotton
frocks were left at the Bainbridge and aunt said we couldn’t ask for
them as I’d left, and they said I could keep this and my best, as I’d
got them with me, but I wish they hadn’t.  Mightn’t some poorer child
than me have this?  It is so hideous and uncomfortable."

She had come close up to Mr. Wycherly and was pleading as though her
very life depended on it.

Mr. Wycherly drew her between his knees, and there was a look of
considerable amusement on his handsome old face as he asked: "If it is
so ugly and so uncomfortable, why should you want to bestow it upon
anybody else?"

"But it’s quite good," Jane-Anne expostulated; "we couldn’t throw it
away.  Some child might be glad of it.  I’m not.  Let’s talk about what
I shall have," she added coaxingly, and somehow she found herself
sitting on Mr. Wycherly’s knee.

It was years since she had sat on anybody’s knee, and that she should do
so again and in such circumstances seemed to her inconceivably
delightful.

Jane-Anne expanded like a flower.

It did not seem such an extraordinary thing to Mr. Wycherly that a child
should sit on his knee.  He had served a long and somewhat severe
apprenticeship to Montagu and Edmund, who both had generally elected to
sit upon him at the same time.  What most impressed him about Jane-Anne
was that she was distressingly light.

They had a long and intimate confabulation on the subject of frocks,
finally deciding that, with Mrs. Dew’s permission, Mrs. Methuen should
be taken into their counsels.

The clock struck nine.

Jane-Anne flung her arms round his neck and kissed him, and yet again he
opened the door for her as she went out.

The following afternoon Mrs. Dew sent her out to do some messages, and
while she was outside a shop—there were hats in that shop, and Jane-Anne
flattened her nose against the window in her enthusiastic interest—two
ladies came out to a carriage that was waiting at the kerb.

The ladies were gorgeously arrayed, evidently on their way to some
party, and she turned to stare after them admiringly.  The footman
slammed the door, leapt upon the box, and the carriage started, when she
observed that one of the ladies had dropped her purse in the gutter.  It
was a pretty trifle made of links of gold in the shape of a little bag.
She picked it up at once and darted after the carriage, calling out to
them to stop, but the ladies shook their heads at her and the coachman
was far too exalted a personage to take any notice at all.  The footman
did just look round, but he regained his proud immobility in the next
second of time.

There was a good deal of traffic that afternoon and the carriage could
not get along very fast.  Jane-Anne ran after it, never letting it get
out of sight, though she was breathless and tired, and her heart thumped
in her ears in a fashion that was rather too realistically reminiscent
of Bruey to be altogether agreeable. She was almost giving up in despair
when the carriage turned in through big gates.  Faint, but pursuing,
Jane-Anne followed and ran up the broad path after it.  There were many
gaily dressed people standing about, who stared at her, and numbers of
other carriages so that the one she followed had to go very slowly. She
came up with it just as it stopped at an entrance.

The ladies saw her.  "Go away, little girl," said the younger crossly;
"we have nothing for you, and you have no business to follow us."

Too breathless and exhausted to speak, Jane-Anne held out the purse
towards her.

"Good gracious!  I must have dropped it, and you followed us; how very
kind.  I suppose I’d better give her something," in an aside to her
companion.  "I hope I’ve got some small change.  Here you are, and thank
you very much."

She selected sixpence and held it out towards Jane-Anne.

Now Jane-Anne wanted that sixpence dreadfully, for she hadn’t a farthing
in the world; but she had conceived a dislike for the lady; she was
indignant at being taken for a beggar, and having somewhat recovered her
breath, she said very distinctly:

"No, thank you; but I think you might have told the coachman to stop,
then I shouldn’t have had to run so far," and with her head in the air,
she set off down the drive again.

A good many people had arrived at the door, and they were all listening.

She hadn’t gone far when she heard quick footsteps behind her and a
short, good-tempered looking gentleman pulled her by the arm. He wore a
festal white waistcoat and looked the personification of jollity.  "You
were quite right to refuse her beggarly sixpence, my dear," he remarked
confidentially; "but it’s a shame you shouldn’t have something for your
trouble; very good-natured of you, I call it, to run all that way.
Here, you go and buy some lollipops with this!" and he held out two
bright new half-crowns towards Jane-Anne.

Never had she seen so much wealth, and it was hers just for the taking;
and yet she was certain she ought not to take it; that Mr. Wycherly
would not like it; and already she had begun to identify herself with
him.

She shook her head a little sadly.  "No, thank you," she said very
gently, for this time she felt the donor meant to be kind.  "I mustn’t,
thank you," and she went on her way.

The stout gentleman looked after her and scratched his chin.  "That was
a nasty one," he said to the nearest passer-by.  "The lass is a lady and
I offered her five bob."

Jane-Anne made her way blindly into the road.  She was nearly run over
three several times by carriages coming up the drive.  As she turned
into the open she charged into someone walking in the opposite
direction, and recovering from the impact, discovered that she had run
into Mr. Wycherly.

Mutual explanations followed.  Mr. Wycherly was taking the daily walk he
had promised Montagu to take.  Jane-Anne explained her presence at the
garden-party, but said nothing about the rewards offered.

Presently she found herself walking home hand in hand with Mr. Wycherly,
and when they reached the house he said: "We must have more walks
together, you and I, and if I forget to go out you must come and stir me
up."

At tea she told her aunt about the purse, and about the money offered.

"You were quite right to refuse it," said Mrs. Dew, "an’ I’m glad you
had that much sense; but what made you?"

"I thought the master wouldn’t have liked it."

"The master needn’t never have known nothing about it."

"But I should have known," said Jane-Anne.




                             *CHAPTER XII*

                                *FOUND!*

"And if she can have access to a good library of old and classical
books, there need be no choosing at all ... turn her loose into the old
library every wet day, and let her alone ... let her loose in the
library, I say, as you do a fawn in the field.  It knows the bad weeds
twenty times better than you; and the good ones, too, and will eat some
bitter and prickly ones, good for it, which you had not the slightest
thought would have been so."  _Sesame and Lilies_.


Jane-Anne had got her heart’s desire. She was allowed to wait upon Mr.
Wycherly. She laid his breakfast and carried it in. She laid his
luncheon and his dinner and her good aunt brought the heavy trays to the
slab outside the dining-room door, and Jane-Anne fetched dishes one by
one and set them on table or sideboard, and handed vegetables and poured
out Mr. Wycherly’s beer for him from the old brown Toby jug that had
once belonged to Admiral Bethune.

It was brought about in this wise.  When Jane-Anne had been in Holywell
about a month there came a letter for her one morning.

Now, that she should have a letter at all, except from her aunt, was a
tremendous and most untoward event.  Yet it was undoubtedly for her, for
it was addressed Miss Jane-Anne (no surname), c/o M. Wycherly, Esq., not
enclosed in one of his, but stamped and sent to her direct.  She found
it on her plate at breakfast when she came down, and turned it over and
over in her hands before she opened it.

The handwriting was small, clear and upright, and rather like Mr.
Wycherly’s own. She noticed this at once as she had often taken his
letters to post for him.

"Aren’t you going to open your letter?" her aunt asked.

Nervously Jane-Anne tore the envelope, flushed and paled, as she always
did when excited, and then read it eagerly in absolute silence.

"Well?" Mrs. Dew demanded impatiently. "Who’s been writing to you?"

"It’s from Master Montagu," Jane-Anne cried breathlessly.  "He’s written
to _me_, to ask me to see that Mr. Wycherly eats his meals—oh aunt you
_will_ let me wait on him now, won’t you?"

"What’s he say?" asked Mrs. Dew.


"My dear Jane-Anne," she read aloud, "I’m glad to hear from Guardie
you’re all right again. It would be decent of you if you’d write to me
sometimes and tell me how he is, for he never says himself.  And there’s
another thing: I wish you’d go in and out sometimes at meals and see
that he isn’t reading and forgetting to eat at all.  That’s what he does
if he isn’t watched, Robina told me.  Just go in and joggle his elbow
and remind him, if he’s got a book, especially if it’s ’Aeschylus’; he’s
very fond of that and forgets the chops and potatoes and everything.
And please make him go out every day; you might take him.  You see he
used always to take Mause, our dog, for a walk, but she’s dead, poor
thing.

"You’ve not got much to do, with no school, so just look after Guardie
like a good kid.  I shall be awfully obliged, and please write.

"Yours truly,
       "MONTAGU BETHUNE WYCHERLY."


"There," said Jane-Anne.

"I’ll not say but what it’s quite a good idea," Mrs. Dew admitted,
"though you can’t go jogglin’ the master’s elbow or any impudence of
that sort.  Still, you might wait on him, and if he gets reading, just
go quiet and say ’potatoes, sir,’ or ’peas, sir,’ and it’ll bring ’im
back. It goes to my very heart when he forgets and leaves a homelette
till it’s all flat and tough, an’ it’d come easier like from you—you can
stop in the room at lunch and dinner, and stand be’ind him at the
sideboard.  And mind you don’t get woolgathering too, as is but likely."

"Can I have a cap and apron, like Mrs. Methuen’s parlour-maid?" Jane
Anne asked eagerly, desirous to dress to the part.

"Certainly not; you’d look ridiklus.  I don’t want any tweeny maids in
this house—you go in neat and tidy in one of the nice dresses as Mrs.
Methuen got made, and behave quiet and respectful, an’ if there’s
company—why I’ll wait myself, though I don’t care about it much, it not
bein’ what I’ve bin used to."

"Why couldn’t I wait if there was company? I’d be very quick and quiet,
and I’d love to hear the gentry talk."

"We’ll see first how you waits without," said Mrs. Dew, ever dubious as
to Jane-Anne’s practical capacities.

So it came about that she waited on Mr. Wycherly that very day at lunch,
and when she handed him the vegetables he murmured something about
"tender little thumbs" which puzzled her extremely.

She was very deft and quiet, because she wanted to wait well, and
whatever Jane-Anne wanted to do, that she did excellently.  She had
watched Mrs. Methuen’s parlour-maid, and she modelled herself on that
very superior young person.  So quiet was she, that at first, Mr.
Wycherly would sometimes forget she was there, and pick up the brown
calf-bound book with the queer scratchy print, that Jane-Anne already
loved because she knew it was Greek, and fall a-reading only to be
instantly recalled by a vegetable dish presented at his elbow and a prim
low voice (even her voice was modelled on Mrs. Methuen’s parlour-maid)
remarking, "Cabbage, sir," or something of the sort.

But although Jane-Anne completely forgot herself in the ardour of her
impersonation, Mr. Wycherly after the very first did not forget
Jane-Anne.

"Couldn’t you stand where I can see you?" he suggested after about a
week of her ministrations, "or better still, sit down."

"Oh, sir, I mustn’t sit down," she remonstrated in shocked tones;
"parlour-maids never do that."

"Don’t they?" said Mr. Wycherly.  "It’s so long since I had a
parlour-maid I’ve forgotten. When I was young I was generally waited
upon by men, and in Scotland we never had any waiting at all; we helped
each other."

"Men are best," Jane-Anne replied from her place on the hearth-rug where
she had obediently taken her stand.  "If I grow up good-looking perhaps
I may marry a first footman."

"Good God!" ejaculated Mr. Wycherly in tones of the utmost
consternation.

Jane-Anne looked very surprised.

"There was a first footman at Dursley House. Oh, he was a beautiful
young man!" she exclaimed in reminiscent rapture; "so dignified."

Mr. Wycherly was quite shaken out of his usual smiling fatalism.  Had he
been able at the moment to analyse his feelings he would have been
amazed at the violence of his objection to a first footman as a possible
husband for Jane-Anne.  But just then he was only conscious of strong
resentment at the very idea.

It was one thing for her to wait upon him, but to think of his Greek
nymph in intimate relations with anybody’s first footman was
inconceivable.  He grew hot all over, and his chief desire at that
moment was to knock somebody down.

There she stood by the fireplace, slender and virginal and sweet, a
graceful, gracious figure in the straight blue linen dress Mrs. Methuen
had chosen for her, regarding him with large surprised brown eyes, and
calmly proposing to marry a footman.

"Do you not think it would be nice?" she asked.

"My dear," said Mr. Wycherly, recovering himself with difficulty and
striving ineffectually to speak with his usual calm detachment, "it is
an outrageous and impossible contingency, and I beg that you will
forthwith dismiss it from your mind at once and for ever."

"Sir, you are not eating your dinner," Jane-Anne remarked after a
moment’s silence.

"How can I eat if you suggest such horrible things?" Mr. Wycherly
complained.

"But I’d like to marry somebody," Jane-Anne protested, "and I wouldn’t
like an ugly person."

"Heavens!" exclaimed Mr. Wycherly.  "Are footmen the only good-looking
men in the world?"

"They’re the best-looking men in our walk in life, sir," Jane-Anne
rejoined primly, in exact imitation of her aunt.

"Come here, Jane-Anne," said Mr. Wycherly.

She went obediently and stood beside him.

"Have you ever thought," he said gravely, "that your walk in life may be
precisely what you choose to make it?"

"No, sir," she said frankly, "I’ve always supposed I should be a
servant—there doesn’t seem anything else for me to be.  You see, aunt
knows she could get me into a good family."

"I don’t think you’re strong enough for a servant," Mr. Wycherly
objected.

"Then," she said decidedly, "I think I’d better be a ward."

"A ward?" Mr. Wycherly repeated in puzzled tones.

"Your ward, like Master Edmund and Master Montagu.  I’d like that, it
would be lovelly."

Mr. Wycherly laughed.  "It seems to me," he said, "that I have already
adopted you."

"Then that’s all right for just now, but afterwards, when I’m grown up,
what would you like me to be, sir?"

"We’ll think about that later on.  Just now I want you to be an entirely
happy little girl, to dance in the sunshine and get fat and merry——"

"I hope I shall never be fat," she interrupted. "I think it’s hideous."

"Well, perhaps not fat—but plump and round and jolly—to learn all your
good aunt teaches you and to read for yourself——

"May I read the books in the book-case in the parlour?" she asked
eagerly.  "I’ll be so careful.  I don’t spoil books, I truly don’t."

"Certainly you may; you will find many excellent books among them, and
when I come back—I’m going to London for a few days, to-morrow—you shall
tell me what you have read and we’ll talk it over together."

The book-case in the dining-room was full of books that had belonged to
Miss Esperance, and Mr. Wycherly felt that he was perfectly safe in
giving Jane-Anne permission to read any of them.  He had never even
troubled to see what they were.  He knew there was a whole edition of
Sir Walter and most of the standard novels up to about the year 1870.
Many theological works, and the little gilt books—precious these—that
had come to Miss Esperance from her own mother.

"You won’t be long away, I hope, sir?" Jane-Anne said wistfully.  "It
will seem very lonely when you are gone."

"I shall not be a moment longer than I can help, and I shall expect to
hear all sorts of interesting news when I come back."

"Do you think I could ever learn to be a lady, sir—if I can’t be a
servant?"

"I see no reason why you should not grow up a very charming lady."

"But ladies don’t dust and wash dishes and do things like I do."

"As I do," Mr. Wycherly corrected almost mechanically.  Then, as if he
had not spoken, he went on, "the best and most beautiful lady I ever
knew did all these things."

"Did she like doing them?"

"I don’t think she ever thought much about what she liked or disliked.
She did what she had to do, and did it better and more gracefully than
anybody else."

She pondered over this.  It seemed to her an impossible ideal.  How
could anyone do a thing "more gracefully than anybody else" just because
it had to be done?  Liking had everything to do with Jane-Anne’s doings.

When she had cleared away, Mr. Wycherly sat long over his glass of port.
He did not read. He did not drink his wine, but sat on at the table
staring at nothing, and wondering about the future of this queer, lonely
child who had crept into his heart so quietly and imperceptibly that not
till she made that astounding announcement as to her matrimonial
ambitions did he realise how dear she had become.

He had released the starling; it was true.

The bird was very tame, and came at call to his hand; but the wings were
there, young and strong and untried.

When the time came for flight, whither would they bear her?

                     *      *      *      *      *

On Thursday Mr. Wycherly went to London. He was to remain over Sunday,
in order to hear an old friend preach at the Temple Church. On Friday
morning Jane-Anne hied her to the parlour to inspect the book-case.

It is true that all the books in the dining-room had belonged to Miss
Esperance, but Mr. Wycherly had reckoned without the Admiral. His books
were there too.  These included the works of Henry Fielding and Tobias
Smollett, and there was on the top shelf a long row of little books,
"the dear and dumpy twelves" beloved by our ancestors.

The book-case was a tall one, and, with the natural perversity of
children, Jane-Anne attacked the top row first.  Just because she could
not reach it, she desired ardently to look at the small dull-coloured
books on the top shelf.  So she dragged up a chair, placed a work-box
upon that and then, mounted upon the two, she could read the titles on
the books, and pull the books out at her ease.

There were ten little books all alike, bound in dark green cloth with a
shield and a coronet in gold above the title on the backs, and a golden
crest on the front cover.  Haphazard she pulled one out just to look at
it.

Evidently it had been much read at one time, for it opened of itself and
she saw that it was poetry and that certain of the verses were marked at
the side in pencil, just as she marked her favourite texts.

    "The isles of Greece, the isles of Greece,
    Where burning Sappho loved and sung."


Where had she heard those lines before?

Slowly and carefully she read on till she gave a little cry and nearly
fell off the work-box in her excitement.

    "The mountains look on Marathon—
      And Marathon looks on the sea—
    And musing there an hour alone,
      I dreamed that Greece might still be free."


The long quest was at an end.

The poem that her father had chanted as he used to carry her about, was
found.

She jumped off the work-box on to the floor, and sat down upon it,
leaning her back against the book-case.

The tears were wet on her cheeks as she read, and her breath came
quickly as though she had been running.  She was deeply moved.  She
repeated the lines softly, whispering them to herself, sometimes
mispronouncing the long words but ever vividly and intensely alive to
the music of the measure, to the nobility of the conception, to the
tragic dignity of its expression.

The dew of genius had fallen upon the thought, and the words bloomed
again in their fiery beauty for this small, unlettered girl, who, with
something of the spirit of old Greece, sat weeping over the wonder of
it.

Over and over again she read those sixteen verses, till she heard her
aunt calling her to come to dinner, and, carrying the precious work with
her, she darted upstairs to her bedroom, hid it in a drawer, and rushed
down again in a tumult of excitement that could find no outlet.

"You’ve got a cold, Jane-Anne," said Mrs. Dew as she carved the joint.
"Your nose is red an’ you’re sniffling."

Jane-Anne did not explain.  The imputation must be borne.

"I don’t think it’s much, aunt," she said meekly.  "Did you ever," she
added in her eager way, "hear of anybody called Lord Byron?"

"He never visited where I lived," Mrs. Dew answered; "but then there’s
a-many lords as I never heerd on.  Why do you want to know?"

"I only wondered.  It would have been nice if you’d known about him.  He
wrote poetry."

"Then I shouldn’t think as he was much of a lord.  The real old families
don’t do such things.  Perhaps he made his money in beer (there’s a good
many such) and then took to writing poetry to amuse himself when he’d
retired.  You may depend it was somethin’ of the sort.  Now you come to
mention it, I’ve a notion as your mother had some of his poetry books.
She’d seen the places as he wrote about—yet I don’t hold much with
poetry myself, and the books was all sold—only a few pence they
fetched—after she died."

Jane-Anne felt chilled and disappointed.  She disliked the smell of beer
exceedingly, and to connect it with the author of these soul-stirring
verses was impossible.  She could find out, she was sure, all about Lord
Byron when Mr. Wycherly returned; but she was an impatient person—how
could she wait until then?

A bright thought struck her.

"Aunt, don’t you think I ought to answer Master Montagu’s letter?" she
asked diplomatically.  "Will you give me a stamp and I’ll do it this
afternoon."

"Mind you’re respectful and proper—you’d better let me see the letter
before it goes.  And if it’s suitable, I’ll give you a stamp."

"Very well, aunt," Jane-Anne sighed.  It was very hard to write what
would seem suitable to those unsympathetic eyes—but she’d have a try for
the thing she wanted.

Ink was provided, one sheet of paper, an envelope, a pen, with a point
like a needle, and a single sheet of much-used blotting-paper.

Jane-Anne sat down at the table in the housekeeper’s room and wrote in a
neat, round hand:


"DEAR MASTER MONTAGU,

"I send my duty and the master was quite well when he left yesterday.

"I wait upon him at meals and he doesn’t read at all now; he talks to
me, and I think he eats pretty well considering.  I also go out with
him, which is very beautiful.  It is very sad here now he is gone.  I
wonder if you are acquainted with a poetry book named ’Don-Juan,’ or if
you think it squish like ’Home Influence.’  I don’t think it is like
’Home Influence,’ but I love it, I shall read it all, it is in two vols.
The master said I was to read any books I liked in the parlour; there
are ten volumes by his Lordship there.  I shall read them all.  Can you
tell me if he is one of the real gentry like Lord Dursley.  I would like
to see him.

"Yours respectfully,
       "JANE-ANNE."


Mrs. Dew read the letter through and grunted that it was much too long,
but she gave Jane-Anne a stamp, which she immediately affixed.  Then she
frolicked gleefully to the post and put her precious missive in the box.




                             *CHAPTER XIII*

                              *A FAR CRY*

    "I have not loved the world, nor the world me—
    But let us part fair foes; I do believe,
    Though I have found them not, that there may be
    Words which are things, hopes which will not deceive,
    And virtues which are merciful, nor weave
    Snares for the failing; I would also deem
    O’er others’ griefs that some sincerely grieve;
    That two, or one, are almost what they seem,
    That goodness is no name, and happiness no dream."
      _Childe Harold’s Pilgrimage._


The boys always wrote to Mr. Wycherly on Sundays and as they knew he was
to be in London over the week-end, he duly received his weekly letters
on Monday morning at Morley’s Hotel.

Edmund’s was, as usual, brief and to the point.  He hoped his guardian
was well; he announced the cheering intelligence that he himself was
well, and after a brief reference to his most recent scores at cricket,
concluded with the information: "It is expensive here at school; the
munny I came back with is all gone; it is very inconvenient.  Could you
spair me a little more?"

Montagu talked of his work and of the Greek play they were reading, and
then he finished up with: "I had quite a decent letter from Jane-Anne.
Whatever made you start her on Byron?  I haven’t read ’Don Juan’ myself,
but I suppose I must, as she has, then we can talk about it in the
holidays."

Mr. Wycherly read this portion of Montagu’s letter three times, frowned
over it, pondered it; and finally, _apropos_ of nothing, found himself
repeating Miss Stukely’s favourite quotation which had remained in his
mind with provoking persistency.

"You in your small corner, I in mine."  He hadn’t the vaguest notion
whence this flower of thought was culled, but it occurred to him at that
moment that Jane-Anne’s small corner must have been considerably
enlarged during the last few days if she had read much of "Don Juan."

"It is quite time I returned to Holywell," Mr. Wycherly reflected.
"What possible wind of fate has blown ’Don Juan,’ of all things, across
the child’s path?  And what in the world will she make of it?"

He went back to Holywell that afternoon, and Jane-Anne carried in his
tea in her best parlour-maid manner, only to relapse immediately into
herself, falling upon her knees by his chair and covering his hand with
kisses the moment she had set down the tray.

"My child, my child," exclaimed Mr. Wycherly, "it is very wonderful and
delightful of you to be so glad.  But you must get up and sit beside me
and pour out tea, and tell me all the news, and what has been happening
since I went away, and what you have been doing with yourself?"

"A very great thing has happened," Jane-Anne said solemnly, holding the
teapot poised in mid-air.  "I have found it."

Mr. Wycherly nearly said, "Found what?" but he stopped himself just in
time, and remembered "the mountains," and asked kindly:

"Well, and where is it?"

"In Marathon," said Jane-Anne gravely. "Do you know it?"

"Yes," Mr. Wycherly replied, "and it is a curious thing that I was
reminded of that very poem when I saw you dancing in the garden. I
wonder why I didn’t connect it with your mountains?"

"I often dance.  I dance when I’m happy, and I dance when I’m very full
of feelings, not exactly happy, but—big, tremendous feelings."

"Tell me, my child, what you think of ’Don Juan’ as far as you have
read."

"Poor dear," cried Jane-Anne, "he was so unfortunate.  No sooner did he
get comfortably settled with a nice, beautiful lady than some cross old
husband or father, or somebody, interfered.  It was a shame."

"Perhaps," Mr. Wycherly suggested, "there may have been something to say
on their side, too, you know.  Though it is a side less often treated by
the writers of romance."

"Haidée’s father was horrid," she cried vehemently.  "You must think so,
too, don’t you?"

"Suppose," said Mr. Wycherly, "I went away for a long time, so long that
you came to the conclusion I was dead——"

"I should die, too," Jane-Anne interrupted.

"Oh, no, you wouldn’t.  Suppose, say, that some very charming and
delightful youth appeared who took up all your attention, and suddenly I
came back to find you giving a grand party in the garden."

"Aunt would never permit it for one minute," she cried, aghast.

"But we must eliminate aunt; Haidée, so far as we know, had no wise and
excellent aunt to look after her.  Let me see.  Oh, yes! Suppose I came
back and found this festivity going on, the agreeable youth acting as
host, and you, my dear, entirely absorbed in him, and the whole house
upside down.  Would you expect me to feel very amiable?"

Jane-Anne gazed earnestly at Mr. Wycherly. The gentle, high-bred face
was quite grave, though persons better versed than Jane-Anne in
subtleties of expression might have noted a look of considerable
amusement in his handsome eyes.

"But Haidée’s father wasn’t a bit like you," she objected.  "He was a
cruel pirate."

"Even pirates have their parental feelings," he pleaded.

Jane-Anne looked much perturbed.

"It sounds horrid said like that," she murmured sadly; "but it’s
beautiful in the poetry book."

"How much have you read?" asked Mr. Wycherly.

"Only to where poor, pretty Haidée dies.  I don’t read very fast, you
know—not like you, sir, and Master Montagu; and when I like a bit I read
it over and over again."

"And what do you like best in the book so far as you have gone?"

"Oh, my father’s poem, far, far the best.  I can say it nearly all by
heart.  But one reason I’ve been so slow is, I wanted dreadfully to know
about Lord Byron, and in the bottom shelf, where ’Sir Stafford Raffles’
is, I found a book all about him, a fat crimson book, and I’ve been
reading that."

"Really," Mr. Wycherly remarked, "you’ve lost no time.  Well, and what
do you make of that?"

"It’s rather difficult, sir, so many letters; but he seems to have been
very unlucky, too, like Don Juan.  A _most_ unkind mother; fancy, she
threw the fireirons at him, and her one of the gentry—and his wife
didn’t seem very nice either—and then I looked at the end——"

"Well?" said Mr. Wycherly, for Jane-Anne paused suddenly.

"And I found he’s dead, and he died to help Greece; and I’m so sorry."

"Sorry he died to help Greece?"

"No, for that’s why my daddie loved him, I’m sure of that; but because
he’s dead.  _I_ should have loved him dearly."

"A great many people did that," said Mr. Wycherly.

"I shall read all his poetry books, and learn all the bits I like; and
then—perhaps—do you think that, up in heaven, he could ever know how
much I cared?"

Mr. Wycherly looked into the eager, wistful face, and wondered, too.

"Listen to me, my child," he said.  "I think that if Lord Byron does
know, he is very pleased and touched; but I also think that he would be
the very first person to suggest that you should wait a little before
you read all his poetry.  If you will allow me, I will select the
volumes I think he would prefer you to begin on.  ’Don Juan,’ for
instance, I should leave alone for the present; directly you know by
heart and can write out, in your most beautiful writing, the whole of
your favourite poem from the third canto——"

"I can do that now," she cried eagerly. "Would it please Lord Byron, do
you think, sir?"

"I am certain of it."

"And you’ll tell me what you think he’d like me to read.  I should so
love to do something for him; poor dear, so sad and lonely often.  Did
you ever know him, sir?"

Mr. Wycherly shook his head.  "He died a good many years before I was
born."

"So long ago!"  Jane-Anne’s voice was solemn and awestruck, for Mr.
Wycherly seemed to her incalculably old and wise.

"One thing, sir," she continued in quite a different tone, "I have quite
altered.  I shan’t marry a first footman—I shall marry a poet.  I shall
hunt about till I find someone like Lord Byron—if he’s a lord so much
the better.  I’d like that; but if he isn’t—if he can say very beautiful
things, I shall love him just the same.  Shall you like that better,
sir?"

Mr. Wycherly sighed.  "I’m afraid, my dear, that I’m a selfish old
curmudgeon, who would like to keep you in his heart-pocket always. I
shan’t like any of them."

"Then I shall stay in your pocket," said Jane-Anne.

It was time to clear away, and she took the tea-things back to the
kitchen.

Mr. Wycherly went into the parlour, a room he rarely entered except when
the boys were at home.  He set his glasses firmly on his nose and
inspected the contents of the book-case.

Just before he went away, Jane-Anne had pressed her favourite "Bruey"
upon him, and he had read it.  Now he took down the second volume of
"Don Juan"—the first was missing—from the top shelf, and turned the
leaves, shaking his head:

"It’s a far cry from Bruey to Byron," thought Mr. Wycherly.  "I wonder
if I have done the right thing?  On one point I am quite convinced, for
the ultimate safety of that child, we must set about developing her
sense of humour at once."

Jane-Anne was so excited over her find, that she wrote to Miss Stukely
to tell her about it.  This time she begged a sheet of paper and an
envelope from Mr. Wycherly, and he gave her a packet of each, the
envelopes ready stamped being the kind he always used.  She was highly
elated, carried the ink to her bedroom without consulting her aunt, and
sat down at her washstand to indite the following letter:


"DEAR TEACHER,

"I hope you are well.  I am well and most happy.  I live with my aunt,
and I have a carpet in my bedroom—not oilcloth; and it is a beautiful
big room.  The master here is like an angel—he is so kind and good.
There are a most enormous lot of books in this house.  I hope to read
them all before I am grown up. I am learning the Greek alphabet.  The
master is teaching me.  Do you know of a poet called Lord Byron?  I am
reading all his poetry books.  I am sure you would love them.  I found a
poem my father used to say to me when I was a little girl.  I was so
glad. Lord Byron wrote it, too.  He is in heaven, so I can’t see him.
With love and duty, from your affectionate friend,

"JANE-ANNE."


By return of post came a letter from Miss Stukely.


"MY DEAR JANE-ANNE,

"I was glad to hear from you that your health is better.  But, dear
childie, there was much in your letter to disquiet me.  I do beg of you
to read no more poetry that is not known to be of sound evangelical
teaching.  I should like you to promise me that you will not read any
poetry except what is by Frances Ridley Havergal, Eliza Cook, or Mrs.
Hemans.  The works of those three saintly women can only do you good,
and there is only too great reason to fear that poetry as a rule leads
one’s thoughts away from higher things.  So promise me this, my dear
girlie, that my mind may be at rest about you.  As to this Lord Byron
you mention, I have never read any poem of his and I never shall, for I
understand that he was a man of very evil life, and an unbeliever, and
that it is quite unlikely he is in heaven, as you seem to suppose.  I
hope you will dismiss him and all his works from your mind.  I cannot
see any use in your learning the Greek alphabet.  The Ancient Greeks
were wicked heathens, and it can do no one any good to know about them.
I hope you read ’The Upward Path’ regularly.  I shall always be glad to
hear from you, and I shall never fail to remember you in my prayers.
Like our dear Bruey, I keep my daily little list and I hope you do the
same.

"Let me have your promise, dear girlie, and I shall feel more happy
about you—although we are parted in body we can still commune in spirit,
and I shall be most happy to supervise your reading, and to send you
little suitable books from time to time.  I have a sweet class at the
Bainbridge, and our weekly meetings are very helpful.  Always your
friend and well-wisher,

"BLANCHE STUKELY."


Jane-Anne found this letter somewhat difficult to decipher, as Miss
Stukely wrote a sloping, pointed hand, much more trying to read than
that of Montagu or his guardian.

So, in defiance of all her aunt’s rules, she invaded Mr. Wycherly in his
study directly after breakfast, and asked him to read it aloud for her.
He did so, and when he had finished she cast herself upon the ground
despairingly, and burst into violent sobs.

This tragic reception of what, to him, seemed a singularly
ill-considered and narrow-minded letter, fairly flabbergasted Mr.
Wycherly, and for a minute or two he sat at his table in perfect
silence, holding Miss Stukely’s missive in his hand, irritably aware
that it was written on scented note-paper, and that he abominated the
odour.  He looked down at the lithe, slender figure prone upon the floor
in absolute abandonment of grief, and at last he asked:

"Why do you cry, Jane-Anne?"

Jane-Anne rolled over, sat up, and gasped out between her sobs:

"Because she says he isn’t in heaven, and if he isn’t in heaven then he
must be in hell for ever and ever, and I can never, never feel happy any
more."

"Get up, child, and sit upon a chair," Mr. Wycherly said sternly.  He
had an old-fashioned objection to scenes, and an indefinable feeling
that to lie on the floor was neither decorous nor dignified, even for a
little girl of twelve. Neither physical nor mental _déshabillé_ appealed
to him.  "Now tell me, why should you take it for granted that Lord
Byron—is not in heaven?"

A ray of light pierced the gloom of her outlook, and she stopped crying
to ask eagerly: "Is Miss Stukely wrong, then; was he a good man after
all?"

"Even supposing he were not what is popularly considered a good man.
Even so, what right has this Miss Stukely, or anybody else, to conclude
that Lord Byron——"

"Is in hell."  Jane-Anne glibly finished the sentence.

"Exactly," said Mr. Wycherly.  "What right has she, I say, to assume
anything of the kind?"

"But the wicked do go there."

"What about the thief on the cross?" asked Mr. Wycherly.

"But he repented," she answered promptly.

"And how do you, or Miss Stukely, or I, or anyone know that Lord Byron
was unrepentant?"

"Then you think it is all right?" she asked anxiously.

"I am sure it is all right," Mr. Wycherly replied confidently.

"Could you lend me your handkerchief, sir?" Jane-Anne asked.  "I seem to
have lost mine."

Refreshed by the borrowed handkerchief, and much comforted in soul, she
turned to another part of the letter, asking:

"Do those ladies she speaks of write beautiful poetry, like my mountains
piece?"

"I am not well versed in the writings of the ladies Miss Stukely
mentions," Mr. Wycherly said cautiously, "but I fancy I am safe in
saying that their work does not display the highest poetical genius,
although it is doubtless very pleasing to their admirers."

"Would you promise, if you was me?"

"Certainly not," he answered vigorously. "Nothing would induce me to
promise anything so absurd."

"Absurd?"  Jane-Anne’s voice was astonished; it was not an adjective
which she would have applied to anything so serious.

"Most ridiculous," Mr. Wycherly repeated.

"She will be sorry, and she was very kind to me."

"Never forget her kindness, repay it if ever you get the chance; but
never promise anybody anything without fully understanding what you
undertake."

"Not even you, sir?"

"Certainly not me, of all people—but I hope I should never ask you to
make impossible promises."

"Then I may go on loving Lord Byron?"

"It seems to me that you ought to love him more if you think that he was
sinful and unfortunate, and unhappy.  It’s a poor sort of love that only
cares for the good, the fortunate, the successful."

"Christ was fond of unfortunate people," Jane-Anne said softly.  Not
altogether in vain had she read her New Testament.

"Ah," said Mr. Wycherly, "that is a phase of His character certain of
His followers are apt to forget."

"I shall tell Miss Stukely that," Jane-Anne remarked perkily.

"You most certainly will do nothing of the kind.  You must not preach at
people—it’s—it’s so ill-bred."

Poor Jane-Anne looked very puzzled.

"It’s a very funny thing," she said thoughtfully. "Nothing could be
differenter than aunt and a real gentleman like you, and yet, sometimes,
you both say the same sort of thing. Only, you call it ill-bred, and
she’d call it the heighth of impidence."

"You may take it that we both mean the same thing," said Mr. Wycherly;
and his kind eyes twinkled.

"Well, I don’t understand, and I know aunt’ll be raging because I’m not
there to help to make the beds, but I’m happier.  Here’s your
handkerchief, sir, and many thanks."

And Jane-Anne thrust a damp and sticky ball into Mr. Wycherly’s hand,
quite unconscious of offence.

When the door shut behind her, he dropped the handkerchief into his
waste-paper basket, and he laughed.  It was so like Montagu or Edmund.




                             *CHAPTER XIV*

                            *AN EXPERIMENT*

"Canst play the fiddle?" asked the stranger.
"I don’t know," quoth the Irishman, "but I’ll try if you’ll
lend me the instrument."  _Old Legend_.


Mrs. Methuen was having tea with Mr. Wycherly under the apple-tree at
the side of the lawn.  She came very often to see him for the simple
reason that she found it so exceedingly difficult to persuade him to
come and see her.  He always protested that he had lived out of the
world too long to go a-visiting now, that he did not know how to behave
in society, that he was a fusty old anchorite whom no one could really
want.

Now, Mrs. Methuen really did want him, so she came to see him instead,
to their great mutual satisfaction, and as it was a fine summer and she
generally came at teatime, Mrs. Dew would set it for them under the
apple-tree on the lawn, and Jane-Anne was allowed to carry out the cakes
and bread-and-butter.

On this particular afternoon they had discussed Jane-Anne’s future, for
Mrs. Methuen was full of a new plan, and when she had a new plan she was
wont to be most enthusiastic.

"You see," she was saying, "it would be so much more original than being
a governess; they don’t do any heavy work, and the uniform is so
charming, she’d look sweet in it."

"But do you think," Mr. Wycherly asked dubiously, "that Jane-Anne has
any special gift for looking after little children?  She has had no
experience; why should she be particularly fitted for that?"

"She would be trained," cried Mrs. Methuen eagerly; "it is a splendid
training, and the girls are so sought after—Norland Nurses are never out
of a place——"

"Is your nurse a Norland Nurse?" asked Mr. Wycherly, trying to remember
if he had seen Mrs. Methuen’s nurse in any very enchanting uniform, but
only succeeding in a faint remembrance of a stout, comfortable person
who certainly did look "used to babies."

"Well, no," Mrs. Methuen answered, a trifle shamefaced.  "You see,
mother thought I was young and inexperienced and we had all known Nannie
such years, and—she’s Nannie you see, and no one else was possible."

"Of course, of course," Mr. Wycherly agreed hastily.  "I’m sure it is
most good of you to interest yourself so warmly in Jane-Anne, and such a
career might prove most suitable—but would it not be well to see—could
we not bring her into contact with some little child and see how they
get on?"

"I have it," cried Mrs. Methuen; "she shall go and mind Mrs. Cox’s baby
on the days the nursery is turned out; it would be a great help to her.
They’re not well off, you know, and she has only one servant besides the
nurse, and it will give Jane-Anne a taste for babies: her baby’s a
perfect darling.  It’s a beautiful idea—so helpful to poor Mrs. Cox and
so good for Jane-Anne, and she lives so close, too, only a few doors
down the street.  I’ll go and propose it to her now and come back and
tell you what she says."

No sooner said than done.  Mrs. Methuen found Mrs. Cox at home, unfolded
her scheme to her, laying stress on the benefit it would be to Jane-Anne
and on Jane-Anne’s exceptional fitness for the task.  She also pointed
out the unusual advantages the baby would enjoy in having so refined and
charming an unpaid under-nurse (Mrs. Methuen was fond of Jane-Anne) and
hinted at all sorts of possibilities when she should be older and more
experienced.

Mrs. Cox, wife of a young doctor as yet not very abundantly blessed with
patients, embraced the idea with effusion, and Mrs. Methuen flew back to
Mr. Wycherly to tell him she had arranged it and that Jane-Anne might
make her debut as an embryo Norland Nurse on Tuesday, that day being
Friday.

"She mustn’t attempt to carry a heavy baby," Mr. Wycherly exclaimed
anxiously, knitting his brows distressedly.

"Of course not," Mrs. Methuen said decidedly. "She’d wheel the darling
up and down Holywell in her pram, or perhaps in South Parks Road, it’s
so nice and quiet."

"I hope it’s not a heavy perambulator," Mr. Wycherly murmured.

"Now don’t you worry.  No one would dream of setting Jane-Anne to do
anything hard or heavy.  You wouldn’t, I suppose, object to her sitting
with the baby on her knee, would you?  She’s quite a little baby, only
six months old and very small."

"No," Mr. Wycherly said doubtfully, "if you think it’s quite safe for
the baby."

"My dear Mr. Wycherly, Jane-Anne is nearly thirteen."

"I know," he answered humbly, "that I must appear foolishly nervous to
you—but a tiny baby always seems to me so brittle, and Jane-Anne herself
is—so fragile—she might drop it."

"Don’t you worry," Mrs. Methuen repeated consolingly.  "Mrs. Cox will
take every care of Jane-Anne, and Jane-Anne will take every care of the
baby.  Besides, it’s only once a week, on nursery cleaning day."

Then Mrs. Methuen went to see Mrs. Dew in the kitchen and unfolded the
scheme to her.

Mrs. Dew, of cautious Cotswold habit, viewed the plan with marked
distrust, but she was too well-trained a servant to do other than seem
to acquiesce gratefully in Mrs. Methuen’s kind efforts to benefit her
niece.  So it was settled that Jane Anne should go to Mrs. Cox on
Tuesday morning at ten for a couple of hours, as Mrs. Methuen had
arranged.  The one person who was not consulted was Jane-Anne herself.

Term was over.  The men had all gone down, and next day the Methuen
household was off to the seaside.

Mrs. Methuen’s visit to Mr. Wycherly had been to bid him farewell for a
space; and in arranging this for Jane-Anne she felt she had been really
helpful.

Mr. Wycherly had consulted Mrs. Methuen on many matters connected with
the child. For one thing he had begged her to assist him in developing
her sense of humour.  Whereupon she sent Jane-Anne both the "Alices,"
and suggested she should be allowed to see _Punch_ every week.  She also
gave her "German Popular Stories" and "A Flat Iron for a Farthing."
These works were all of absorbing interest and somewhat interrupted
Jane-Anne’s study of Lord Byron, as had been intended.

_Punch_ she took to her heart at once; not on account of the Immortal
Jester’s humour, but because of the beautiful ladies depicted by Mr. Du
Maurier.  These she whole-heartedly admired and set herself to imitate.

All the same, Jane-Anne was getting on. She laughed very often now,
sometimes from sheer joy at being in a world where there were people so
kind and delightful as Mrs. Methuen and Mr. Wycherly; sometimes because
things really did seem funny.  She began to realise, too, that it was
possible to jest; that Mr. Wycherly often said things that he did not
mean; and that it was conceivable that you might love a person with all
your heart and soul and yet be perfectly cognisant of their little
weaknesses and oddities.  Mr. and Mrs. Methuen taught her this, quite
unconsciously, while she waited upon them when they lunched with Mr.
Wycherly.

Jane-Anne was a quick study.

That night as she waited upon "the master" at dinner, he unfolded to her
Mrs. Methuen’s plan, and Jane-Anne at once burst into floods of tears,
declaring hotly that she’d rather be his parlour-maid than anybody’s
nurse, "not if it was a prince."  That she didn’t want to wait upon a
horrid little baby when there was her own dear master to wait upon, and
she’d promised Master Montagu!

Very gently, Mr. Wycherly explained the arrangement, and when she heard
of the uniform the training lost some of its horror.

"I shan’t have to go for years and years, shall I?" she asked.

"Certainly not for many years; never at all if you don’t like it."

"And I’m to practise on Mrs. Cox’s baby?"

"You are to take care—the greatest care—of Mrs. Cox’s baby for a short
time once a week."

"Do you want me to?"

Candidly, Mr. Wycherly wanted nothing less. He detested schemes for the
ultimate employment of Jane-Anne.  To him, everything suggested seemed
incongruous and infeasible, but he mistrusted his own judgment in
practical matters and bowed before the youthful wisdom and general
competence of Mrs. Methuen.

"I think," he said guardedly, "that every woman ought to know how to
manage a baby."

"I wonder," she said dreamily, "if Lord Byron would approve of it?"

"As we have no means of finding out, let’s take it that he will," he
answered drily.

"I don’t like the name Norland," she objected.

"It will be years before you are even ready to apply for admission to
the Norland Institute," said Mr. Wycherly.

"If it’s an institution, I’m not going," she said firmly.

"What you have got to do is to see how well you can look after Mrs.
Cox’s baby."

"I’ll do my best, I really will," said Jane-Anne, "and it’ll be rather
fun to wheel it about, and I shall look very proud and stand-off like
Mrs. Methuen’s Nannie.  I expect people will admire me very much and
wonder whose nurse I am."

"That is possible," Mr. Wycherly politely acquiesced.

"Shall I have to make the beds that morning, sir?"

"That, my dear child, is your good aunt’s province, not mine."

"Master, dear—whenever you speak of aunt to me, you say she’s good, or
worthy, or excellent, or sensible—do you say those nice things about me
when I’m not there?  Do you say ’my excellent Jane-Anne’ when you talk
about me to Mrs. Methuen?  I hope you do—or ’that most sensible girl’—do
you?"

"How do you know I ever talk about you at all to Mrs. Methuen?"

Jane-Anne looked rather foolish for a moment, then brightened as she
remarked: "But you must to know all about Mrs. Cox’s baby and Norland
Nurses, and that.  I’m sorry, though, that the young gentlemen have all
gone down; I’d like them to have seen me wheeling the pram."

"My dear child," exclaimed Mr. Wycherly with real consternation in his
voice.  "You surely don’t suppose that a well-bred undergraduate would
be aware of the existence of a little girl wheeling a perambulator."

"They’re aware of _my_ existence, anyway, master, dear.  I heard one say
one day: ’Look what hair that flapper’s got.’"

"A most impertinent and ill-bred young man.  I hope you felt very
angry."

"Angry?" she repeated in a surprised voice. "Oh, no; I was pleased he
should admire my hair.  It is very long, you know."

Mr. Wycherly groaned, but he said nothing more, only registering a
mental vow to the effect that nothing would induce him to allow
Jane-Anne to wheel anybody’s perambulator once the men came up again.
"But she’ll be safely at school then," he reflected, "and there will be
an end of these ridiculous schemes."

Mrs. Dew discussed the question with her niece during their supper in
the housekeeper’s room.

"I don’t fancy the notion much, myself," she said.  "A nurse as is worth
having for a nurse is born so, and I don’t see as any institution will
either make or mar her.  Bein’ a fine lady with someone else to do your
nurseries’d suit you well enough, I’ve no doubt, but whether you’d ever
learn to do _your_ part is more than mortal can say."

"Aunt, what do you do with a baby if it cries?"

"Turn it face downwards on your knee an’ pat it gentle—ten to one it’s
got wind, poor little soul, and that’ll break it up.  Many’s the time
I’ve held you that way an’ you starin’ at the carpet with those great
eyes of yours as good as gold.  But you won’t have much nursing to
do—it’s wheelin’ that you’ll be doin’, an’ mind as you don’t let the
wheel go over the kerb.  Whatever it is you’re doin’, Jane-Anne, for
mercy’s sake think about that thing, and don’t go dreamin’ of poetry
books and such foolhardy nonsense."

Tuesday came and it poured with rain.

Jane-Anne duly made her timid appearance at Mrs. Cox’s and was shown
into Mrs. Cox’s study, where the baby sat propped up in her pram while
her mother pushed her back and forth to amuse her.  Mrs. Cox stayed for
a little, then the baby showed signs of wanting to go to sleep, so she
was laid down and Jane-Anne was instructed to continue the gentle to and
fro movement till she "went off," and Mrs. Cox departed to see to some
household matters elsewhere, leaving the door open.

The Cox baby was fair and plump and pretty, and appeared an entirely
exemplary infant, for in five minutes she was fast asleep.

Jane-Anne stopped pushing the perambulator to and fro, and sat down to
look round.  There was a book-case at one side of the fireplace and its
two lowest shelves were full of bound volumes of _Mr. Punch_.  In a
moment, her quick eyes had taken in this pleasing fact and she had one
of the big flat books open on her knee. She looked at the pictures and
read the legends beneath them with great content for a little while,
always, however, with one eye on the perambulator and ears alert to
catch the faintest movement from its occupant.

Presently there was a little stir and the indescribable soft sound a
baby makes when it is just waking up.  From the room above came sundry
bumps and scrapings that proclaimed the cleaning to be in full swing.
She darted to the perambulator and looked in; the baby, rosy and warm
and adorable looked up at her and smiled.  It was too much for
Jane-Anne. She forgot Mrs. Cox’s instructions that she was on no account
to lift the baby out when it woke, but to call her.  She seized the
small delicious bundle that stretched and cuddled against her and sat
down on the low seat close by the book-case.

Baby began to whimper.

Jane-Anne repeated "See-Saw, Margery Daw," but the baby evidently was
impervious to the charms of poetry, and the whimper grew a little more
decided.

Then there flashed into Jane-Anne’s perturbed mind her aunt’s
instructions: "Turn it face downwards on your knee and pat it gentle."
No sooner thought of than done, and it was, apparently, quite
successful.

Jane-Anne had just got to a very interesting part of _Punch_, and she
longed to return to it. As the baby was evidently quiet and happy, she
felt she might go back to her study of the Great Jester—nurses always
were reading—even while they wheeled their prams—so it was all right.
She kept one hand on the baby’s back to steady it and tried to hold up
the volume of _Punch_ with the other, but _Punch_ was heavy and she was
not very successful.

Presently a brilliant thought struck her: If _Punch_ was open on the top
of the baby, it would fulfil a double purpose, keep the baby from
rolling off her knee, and amuse her, Jane-Anne.

It really was a very fascinating _Punch_.

For a moment Miss Cox was perfectly quiet. The heavy weight across her
back petrified her with astonishment.  She tried to lift her head to see
what it all meant, but some hard substance caught her just in the nape
of the neck and prevented her doing anything of the kind.

Such an indignity was not to be borne for an instant.

Miss Cox filled her lungs as well as she could, considering how
compressed she was, and gave vent to a good hearty roar of rage and
grief that such impertinent persons should be left loose in a naughty
world.

Jane-Anne absently patted the pages of _Mr. Punch_ and read on
absorbedly.

There was a pause in the cleansing operations overhead.  A door was
opened hastily and quick steps descended from above.  At the same
instant, another door was opened just across the hall, and Mrs. Cox and
the nurse met at the open study door to behold the cause of the uproar.

Jane-Anne was never very clear as to what happened during the next three
minutes.  All she knew was that _Mr. Punch_ fell violently on the floor
to the ultimate detriment of his back—the baby was seized from her and
two people hurled indignant reproaches at her while the baby, once more
in a position to inflate properly, filled the air with angry wails.

Of course Jane-Anne wept too.  She made no excuses, for there were none
to be made, and this rather disarmed Mrs. Cox, who was kindly and
gentle, and finding that only the baby’s feelings were hurt, recovered
her sense of humour, laughed, and bade Jane-Anne go back to her aunt as
she was evidently not fitted yet for an under-nurse.

Nurse, with the baby clasped safely in her arms, had already stalked
upstairs in high dudgeon.

Soon after eleven o’clock, a meek, draggled, tear-stained Jane-Anne
crept in at the side-door in Holywell.  Mrs. Dew was in the front of the
house "turning out" the dining-room, as her niece had observed as she
passed the windows.

Upstairs she flew and reached Mr. Wycherly’s study door undetected.  She
looked particularly forlorn and miserable, for she wore her aunt’s
macintosh, a voluminous purple garment much too large for her.  She had
left her umbrella at the Cox’s in the shame of her hasty exit, and the
heavy rain had beaten upon her face, mingling with her tears.  Very
timidly she knocked.

Mr. Wycherly had quick ears, and he knew that knock.

"Come in, my child; they didn’t need you long," he said, always with the
same kind welcome in his voice.

Jane-Anne shut the door softly and rushed across the room to throw
herself on her knees at his side.

"I’m sent away," she cried tragically; "dismissed, disgraced; I don’t
know what aunt will say."

"What in the world has occurred?" Mr. Wycherly said quietly.  "Take off
that wet macintosh; look what a pool it’s making.  Get up, you poor,
silly child; there, that’s better—now come and sit on my knee and tell
me exactly what happened."

Jane-Anne flung herself upon Mr. Wycherly, buried her wet face in his
neck and sobbed out:

"I read _Punch_ on the top of the baby."

At this most unexpected revelation Mr. Wycherly fairly jumped.

"You mean you sat on the baby?" he cried, aghast.

"No, it was _Punch_ sat on the baby and it didn’t like it.  It yelled."

"Do explain—your statements are so confused—what _do_ you mean?"

"I mean," she continued, "I opened _Punch_ on the baby and read it—it
was only a minute, but I was so interested, and I’ve heard them say that
it doesn’t hurt to let a healthy baby cry for a minute—and all the
nurses read, I’ve seen them hundreds of times; but they heard and came
flying all in a hurry and were so cross, and Mrs. Cox said I needn’t
ever come back."

It was well that Jane-Anne couldn’t see Mr. Wycherly’s face, which was
lighted up by a smile of immense satisfaction; but what he _said_
sounded very grave.

"I fear you have not been very honest, little Jane-Anne."

She sat up and looked at him.

"Honest!  I’ve told you exactly what happened."

"Certainly, you’ve been honest to me, but what about Mrs. Cox?"

Jane-Anne hung her head.

"The baby slept at first," she said, "and it was so dull and all the
_Punches_ were there—and I got so interested——"

"You’ve not done what you undertook to do, that was to look after the
baby.  Mrs. Cox didn’t ask you there to read her _Punches_ did she?"

"She’ll never have me again, she said so."

"I’m not surprised."

"What will Mrs. Methuen say?"

"I can’t think."

"And aunt?"

"I don’t think your—aunt" (Mr. Wycherly was just going to say
"excellent," but restrained himself) "will be much surprised."

Jane-Anne sighed deeply.  "I shall never be a Norland Nurse now," she
said sadly.  "I’ve lost my character."

"I’m afraid you have."

"Do _you_ mind very much?"

"Upon my soul," said Mr. Wycherly, "I don’t care a brass farthing."




                              *CHAPTER XV*

                       *THE PHILOSOPHY OF BEAUTY*

"The foundation of beauty is a reasonable order addressed to the
imagination through the senses."  PHILEBUS.


The last time Mrs. Methuen called in Holywell, just before she went
away, she left a ladies’ paper, _The Peeress_.

Jane-Anne fell upon it instantly and carried it off to her room.  She
had never seen such a paper before and her mind was in a curiously
receptive state.  Lord Byron’s Hebrew melodies rang in her ears, and she
immensely enjoyed herself when she went to bed at night by standing in
front of the looking-glass in her night gown, with her thick black hair
streaming round her like a cloud, while she repeated solemnly:—

    "She walks in beauty, like the night
      Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
    And all that’s best of dark and bright
      Meet in her aspect and her eyes.
    Thus mellowed to that tender light
      Which heaven to gaudy day denies."


She quite agreed with the poet that "gaudy day" was a little unkind to
her appearance. She was too brown; moreover, she was no longer pale, and
this rather vexed her.  She had an idea that Lord Byron would have
preferred her pale.  Still she felt that her hair was quite satisfactory
and shook it round her, only grieving that the glass was far too small
to show it all.  There was not a cheval-glass in Mr. Wycherly’s house.
But from time to time she caught sight of her big plait (Mrs. Methuen
had persuaded Mrs. Dew to have Jane-Anne’s hair done in one thick plait
instead of two) in shop windows, with the profoundest satisfaction.

    "One shade the more, one ray the less."


She hoped she had rays in her hair, but was not quite sure.

    "Had half impaired the nameless grace
      Which waves in every raven tress,
    Or softly lightens o’er her face;
      Where thoughts serenely sweet express
    How pure, how dear their dwelling-place."


To obtain the "thoughts serenely sweet" it was but necessary to adopt
the Bruey pose, and, behold, the thing was done.

Mere words cannot express the comfort that poem was to Jane-Anne.  Up
and down her room she sailed, "clothed on in majesty," an unbleached
calico night gown, and her long black hair.

    "The smiles that win, the tints that glow,
      But tell of days in goodness spent,
    A mind at peace with all below,
      A heart whose love is innocent."


At such moments she adored Lord Byron for writing such beautiful things
about her, and was perfectly happy.

Mrs. Methuen’s magazine opened up new possibilities.  From its pages she
learned that no one need despair of their personal appearance. Had
nature been niggardly in the matter of hair, a hundred artists in
coiffure advertised their aid.  Was one’s complexion not quite to one’s
liking, there were skin specialists galore who undertook to remedy any
facial defects.  In fact the journal was a regular _vade mecum_ as to
the cult of beauty, and such pleasing visions were not conjured up by
words alone.  There were pictures in plenty of lovely ladies in every
stage of lack of attire and with every variety of "transformation."
Radiant beings with enormous eyes, preternaturally minute mouths, and
figures so slender that one wondered if they ever had anything to eat.

And every one of them had wavy hair.

Now Jane-Anne’s hair waved just after it was unplaited, but it was
naturally quite straight, soft, fine, abundant hair, growing very
prettily round her face with an upward sweep from her forehead.

It was all very well to walk in beauty like the night.  It was
comparatively easy to imagine one realised Lord Byron’s conception of
the Hebrew beauty.  But here much more was expected.

Jane-Anne was certainly slim, the unkindly accurate might have described
her as decidedly thin; but, even so, she was not shaped at all like the
ladies depicted in _The Peeress_.  Her legs were long and her hips were
small, but—"I seem too thick through," she said to herself.

There was a whole page of replies to anxious students of the Art of
Beauty.  "Pietista" sought to improve a throat "discoloured and too
thin."  "Butterfly" complained of "sagging lines beneath chin and around
mouth."

Jane-Anne flew to the glass but could discover nothing of the kind, and
was comforted.

"Troubled" wanted to know how to "colour dark hair a bright auburn," but
Jane-Anne passed this by.  She was perfectly satisfied with the colour
of her hair.  What she did long for was a box of "Magnolia Bloom
powder," which _The Peeress_ assured "Amabelle" would lend to the
countenance "the soft sheen of a butterfly’s wing."

But this desirable appearance could only be arrived at by the
expenditure of eighteen-pence, and Jane-Anne possessed but
three-halfpence in the world.  The other beautifiers cost such vast sums
as excluded them altogether from her scheme of possibilities.

Eighteenpence: one shilling and sixpence. Once Lord Dursley had given
her a new two-shilling bit and her aunt allowed her to keep it. But,
alas! it was spent long ago, and Lord Dursley was not very likely to
come to Oxford that summer.

She would consult Mr. Wycherly.  She had infinite faith in his sympathy,
his wisdom, and his resource.  She would show him this enchanting
journal and see what he thought of it.  Perhaps he, who read so many
books, was already familiar with its pages.

She carried it with her when she went to bid him good-night.  It had
become an established custom for Jane-Anne to bid him good-night at
considerable length.

"Have you ever read _The Peeress_, sir?" she asked, laying it on his
table on the top of an open book.

"Never," said Mr. Wycherly.  "Is this the lady?"  He opened it, turned
the pages somewhat hastily, and actually blushed.

"My dear child!" he exclaimed, "where did you get hold of this extremely
shameless production?"

"Mrs. Methuen always takes it, sir; it’s a ladies’ paper.  She left this
number here."

"Mrs. Methuen, that refined and charming young lady!  Surely, my dear,
you are mistaken."

"No, sir, really.  Lots of ladies always read it, aunt said so.  I
wanted to take it back to her lest she should want it, but aunt says she
gets it every week, and she didn’t think it mattered."

"That being the case," Mr. Wycherly remarked, hastily shutting the
magazine, "it is evidently not intended for me, and you had better take
it away."

"Oh, sir," Jane-Anne pleaded, "do look at the pictures.  They’re such
beautiful ladies."

But Mr. Wycherly steadfastly averted his gaze from the offending
magazine, exclaiming:

"Beautiful!  My dear child, how can you apply that dignified and really
expressive adjective to anything so dreadful?  Have you ever seen any
human being who in the least resembled the extremely indelicate
creatures depicted in this paper?"

"No, sir, but I’d like to.  They’ve all got such curly hair."

"Most of them," Mr. Wycherly said severely, "appear to wear very little
else.  We must show you some really beautiful pictures, Jane-Anne, and
then perhaps you will realise the worthlessness of these."

She felt that it was an unpropitious moment for the introduction of
"Magnolia Bloom toilet powder."  Mr. Wycherly’s attitude was strangely
unsympathetic.  Nevertheless she was full of tenacity of purpose, so she
said, in what she was assured Bruey would have considered a "winning"
voice:

"Please, sir, is there anything I could do to earn one-and-six?"

Mr. Wycherly laughed.  "I think you have earned it many times over by
all the things you do for me.  Would you like it now?"

He took a handful of silver from his pocket and pushed the coins toward
her, saying:

"I wish they were new ones.  I always think all the new silver ought to
be kept for boys and girls—but if you’re in a hurry—perhaps you’d rather
have it now."

"Thank you very much, sir," said Jane-Anne; but her voice was not
joyful, as one might have expected.

She felt rather uncomfortable.

He had never questioned her as to why she wanted it.

"Are you sure it’s enough?" he asked kindly.

"Quite sure, sir, and I’m very much obliged."

Mr. Wycherly looked at her curiously.  Why was her voice so listless and
flat?

She dropped the coins into the pocket of her dress and stood before him,
rubbing one slender foot over the other, her eyes downcast, quite unlike
the eager, chattering child he loved.

"Good-night, sir," said Jane-Anne.

When she reached her bedroom she felt very miserable indeed.  She
possessed the coveted eighteenpence and was thoroughly ashamed of having
it.  It had been obtained too easily and she felt that she was deceiving
Mr. Wycherly. Without knowing why, she was certain he would not wholly
approve of the purchase of the "Magnolia Bloom powder," and he had never
asked her why she wanted the eighteen-pence.  He trusted her.

Jane-Anne felt mean.

Against her will, the verses she loved returned to her mind:

    "The smiles that win, the tints that glow,
    But tell of days in goodness spent."


Hitherto she had happily considered those lines quite applicable to her
general conduct. Even the disastrous morning at Mrs. Cox’s had not left
behind it the uncomfortable sensations she was now enduring.

She had not been six years in Mrs. Dew’s charge without acquiring
something of that good woman’s sturdy independence.

She had asked for money.

She had taken it; and for a purpose she was certain the donor would
disapprove.

He would call it "meretricious," that curious word Master Montagu had
used.  She had heard Mr. Wycherly use it too.

    "A mind at peace with all below,
    A heart where love is innocent!"


Should she go back and tell Mr. Wycherly why she wanted the money and
let him decide?  Then once more might she "walk in beauty like the
night" with her hair all round her and a light heart.

But he would be certain to advise her not to buy the "Magnolia Bloom."
He wouldn’t forbid it.  That was not his way.  But he would make it
impossible for her to go and buy it—and she wanted it so dreadfully.

Perhaps when he saw how lovely she looked with a face that was no longer
brown but purest white "with the soft sheen of a butterfly’s wing" he
would be glad she was so much improved.

Jane-Anne knelt down and said her prayers and added at the end the
following petition:

"And please, dear Lord, let him admire me very much when I’m all over
’Magnolia Bloom.’"

Mrs. Dew came to take away the candle, but the room was quite light, for
a big yellow moon was shining straight in.

Now was the moment when Jane-Anne usually arose and walked in beauty,
repeating the poem the while.

Instead, she lay quite still.  She felt she had no right to that poem;
Lord Byron had not written it for her.

Why did she feel so certain that he, too, would have disapproved of the
"Magnolia Bloom"?

Jane-Anne cried herself to sleep.

                     *      *      *      *      *

Next day she went to the largest hairdresser’s in Oxford, and presented
herself timidly at a counter laden with all sorts of pots and boxes and
bottles.

She asked for the "Magnolia Bloom" in a weak and trembling voice, and
was relieved to find they had it.

"Which shade will you have?" asked the young lady behind the counter.

"Oh, the very whitest, please!" exclaimed Jane-Anne.

"D’you want a puff, miss?" asked the attendant.

Jane-Anne had never thought of a puff. She shook her head sadly.
Judging by the price of the other things, no puff could be obtained for
three-halfpence, which was all the money she had.

She hurried from the shop.

How expensive it was to be beautiful!

She knew what a puff was, for she had been permitted to assist at and to
admire the bathing of Mrs. Methuen’s baby, and she had seen the nurse
powder him.  She was nothing if not resourceful.  She went to the
nearest jeweller and bought a pennyworth of cotton wool, and armed with
what _The Peeress_ called these "aids to beauty," she returned to
Holywell in a flutter of excitement.

Anxious as she was to try the beautifying effect of the "Magnolia
Bloom," she felt some diffidence in presenting herself before her aunt
thus embellished, so she waited until she had taken in Mr. Wycherly’s
tea and had her own.

It was Mr. Wycherly’s pleasant custom to keep her for half an hour or so
when she went in to take away his tea.  They talked about Greece, and
she had learned to read some of the simple words.  She learned the
alphabet in two evenings, and astonished Mr. Wycherly by her quickness
and receptivity.

She stood in front of her looking-glass that evening and, with hands
that trembled with excitement, applied the "Magnolia Bloom" to her
little brown face.

It never occurred to Jane-Anne that the way to use powder was to put it
on and take it off again.  That would have appeared to her a wasteful
work of supererogation.  She liberally bedaubed her face with the
"snow-white" powder and anxiously regarded the result.

Her eyes looked very dark and large, and her eyebrows, what she had left
of them, very black.  It had rather an ageing effect on the whole, for
so liberal had she been with the powder that her hair all round the
temples was iron grey.

She was not quite sure whether she liked the effect or not.  Even to her
own prejudiced eyes it was a trifle _bizarre_ and pronounced.

Where was the soft sheen of the butterfly’s wing promised to "Amabelle"?

"Perhaps it looks different to other people," she reflected.

She crept to the foot of the stairs and listened.

Yes, her aunt was safely in the kitchen. She darted through the
housekeeper’s room and upstairs to Mr. Wycherly’s door, and went in.

He looked up from the letter he was writing with his usual kindly smile
of welcome, then suddenly he laughed.

"My dear Jane-Anne," he exclaimed, "have you been baking?"

Jane-Anne stood still in the middle of the room and hung her head.

"It’s Magnolia Bloom," she mumbled.

"It’s what?" Mr. Wycherly demanded.

"Magnolia Bloom," she repeated, her cheeks very hot indeed beneath the
powder.

"Is that some new kind of flour?" asked Mr. Wycherly, "and if so why in
the world do you not wash your face?"

"It’s not flour, sir, it’s powder—face powder—to make one white and
pretty?  Don’t you like it?"

Mr. Wycherly sat back in his chair gazing in speechless wonder at
Jane-Anne.  That a girl who admired Lord Byron’s poetry, who could learn
the Greek alphabet in two evenings, who showed a real appreciation of
what was noble and uplifting in the history of her country, could make
such an absolute guy of herself in all good faith was to him quite
incomprehensible. Boys did not do these things.  He was fairly
nonplussed.

"Where did you get this—ahem—bloom?" he asked quietly.

"I bought it, sir, with that eighteenpence."

"Have you much more of it?"

"Oh, yes, sir, a whole box."

"Please bring it, and you shall similarly adorn me and see how I look."

Jane-Anne was puzzled.  He certainly had not admired her, but then,
again, he had not condemned, and he wanted some himself. Swiftly and
softly as a panther (lest she should meet her aunt) she fetched the
powder and the screw of cotton wool from her room.

"Now," said Mr. Wycherly, "do me."

Jane-Anne made a dreadful mess.  All over his coat, his chair (even the
writing-table did not escape), fell the "Magnolia Bloom."

"What a very disagreeable smell the stuff has got," said Mr. Wycherly,
and sneezed. He hated common scents.

At this psychological moment, when they were both smothered in powder
and clouds of it were in the air, Mrs. Dew opened the study door,
announcing:

"Mr. Gloag, sir."

Jane-Anne started violently and upset the box, and the visitor announced
came into the room.

He was tall and young, with a keen, clean-shaven face, merry dark eyes,
and dark curly hair worn a thought longer than is usual with young men.

He stopped short on the threshold, for really the pair before him
presented a most extraordinary appearance.

Mr. Wycherly leapt to his feet, exclaiming:

"Curly, my dear fellow, I am delighted to see you."  He had quite
forgotten the "Magnolia Bloom" in his pleasure at beholding an old
friend.

"Am I interrupting a rehearsal, or what?" the young man asked, as he
shook hands warmly.

Mr. Wycherly sneezed again.  "Oh, this abominable powder; I had
forgotten it for the moment.  Now, Curly, you are an actor; you are
familiar with make-up in every shape and form.  Will you kindly tell
this young lady whether you consider us improved by this whitewash?"

The situation jumped to the eye.  The young man laughed.

"You are both of you rather new to the use of powder, I should say; no
one ever leaves it on, you know."

"Then what on earth is the use of it?" demanded Mr. Wycherly.

"It has, perhaps, a softening effect, but it is never used in such
quantities."

"Go and wash, Jane-Anne," said Mr. Wycherly, "and I must do the same,
then ask Mrs. Dew—no, come yourself with a dustpan and brush and clear
up as well as you can. Curly will go downstairs."

In absolute silence Jane-Anne did as she was bid.  It took a long time
to clean Mr. Wycherly’s study.  There seemed a great deal of "Magnolia
Bloom" for eighteenpence when she had finished.  She emptied the dustpan
into the dustbin, then she went and fetched _The Peeress_.  Mrs. Dew had
gone out to get something extra for dinner, as the gentleman was going
to stay, so Jane-Anne had the kitchen to herself.  She tore _The
Peeress_ across and across and thrust it down into the hottest part of
the fire, putting more coal on the top of it lest her aunt should see it
and wonder.

"There," said Jane-Anne, poking viciously. "You’re a horrid,
meretricious, lying old thing, that you are."




                             *CHAPTER XVI*

                        *THE PURSUIT CONTINUED*

"For beauty draws us by a single hair."  POPE.


Jane-Anne waited at dinner that night, and the stranger with the dark,
vivacious eyes looked at her curiously more than once. When she had set
the port in front of Mr. Wycherly and left the room finally, this guest,
whom he called "Curly," leant forward, saying:

"So that is the new ward?"

"If you like to call her so."

"She is not an ordinary girl."

"I fear not."

"Why fear?"

"Because she will be very hard to place safely."

"My own impression is," Curly said slowly, "that she will need no
placing at all, she will arrange matters for herself."

"You mean she will marry while quite young."

"Not at all.  I should say she is quite unlikely to marry very young,
but she will find a niche for herself, and she won’t follow any beaten
track either."

"When she came first of all," said Mr. Wycherly, "it was understood that
she was to be trained for a servant; the doctor vetoed that—said she
would never be strong enough. Then a charming lady here suggested having
her trained as some very superior sort of nurse—children’s nurse, but I
question whether her genius lies in that direction.  Personally, I can
think of nothing very suitable for Jane-Anne except to delight me and
get strong; but of course one must be practical.  She is extraordinarily
receptive.  She takes pleasure in every kind of beauty, and she is quite
singularly susceptible to beautiful verse.  You should hear her recite
Byron’s ’Isles of Greece.’"

"Why shouldn’t I hear her?  Get her in and ask her to do it, then,
perhaps, I can throw some light on this dark question."

"I can’t say that I think she would be shy," Mr. Wycherly said
dubiously, "for shyness and Jane-Anne seem quite foreign to one another;
but—whether it would be good for her——"

"I’d like to hear her awfully," said Curly persuasively.  "A
housekeeper’s niece, not thirteen, and steeped in Byron sounds such a
delightful anachronism.  Moreover, a little girl brought up by you.
Please let me."

There was something very wheedling about Curly as he rose and went to
the bell.

Mr. Wycherly nodded, and he rang.

Mrs. Dew thought it was for coffee, and that they were in a great hurry.
However, she made it quickly and sent Jane-Anne in with it.

"This gentleman," said Mr. Wycherly, as she set down the coffee in front
of him, "is fond of poetry, and I wonder if you would repeat to him your
favourite verses about Marathon?"

Jane-Anne looked quickly from one to the other.  She stepped back a
little from the table and held up one slender brown hand as if adjuring
them to listen.

Curly leant his elbow on the table and his head on his hand, and sat
still as a statue, his brilliant eyes fixed on Jane-Anne.

She had a musical voice and a singularly clear enunciation.  She no
longer mispronounced any words, for Mr. Wycherly had heard her say the
poem many times and took care of that.  There was, withal, a curious
little foreign distinctness in the way she separated one word from
another that was undoubtedly a reminiscence of her father.  She was
never monotonous and she never ranted; best of all, she was utterly
unconscious of herself and absolutely wholehearted in her lament for her
country, and there was real passion in her young voice as she declaimed:

    "A land of slaves shall ne’er be mine—
    Dash down yon cup of Samian wine!"


No one spoke for a minute, then very gravely and courteously Curly said,
"Thank you."

Jane-Anne turned to go, and Mr. Wycherly rose and opened the door for
her.  She looked up at him as she went out, with timid questioning eyes.

"It was beautiful, my child, quite beautiful," he said.

Jane-Anne went back to the kitchen to wash dishes, perfectly happy.

Curly waited till Mr. Wycherly sat down again.

"And so you wonder what that child will be?" he asked.

"I do, indeed," sighed Mr. Wycherly.

"And she, with those great eyes set so wide apart?"

"That," said Mr. Wycherly, "is the Greek type."

"Every great actress," Curly said sententiously, "has her eyes set wide
apart.  There has never been a ferrety-faced actress worth anything."

"But what has that got to do with Jane-Anne," Mr. Wycherly said in a
puzzled voice.

Curly laughed.  "I shan’t tell you," he said. "Only I know what she will
be, and you needn’t worry or try to stop it, for you can’t."

"I hope she will be nothing of the kind," Mr. Wycherly said hotly.
"Poor little nymph, so sensitive, so loving-hearted, so wise, and at
times, so amazingly silly."

"They are like that," said Curly.

                     *      *      *      *      *

Next morning, Mr. Wycherly told Jane-Anne that the friend who had dined
with him the night before was an actor, and that the company he was in
was performing "As you Like It" that afternoon in a ducal garden not
very far from Oxford; and finally that he was going to take her to see
it.

That day was one long _festa_ for Jane-Anne. First of all came the
drive, sitting side by side with Mr. Wycherly in a hired victoria.  She
wore her best summer frock and hat, beautiful white garments chosen by
Mrs. Methuen, that filled her soul with rapture every time she put them
on; white cotton gloves that Mrs. Dew had washed that morning, thin
black stockings, and the light shoes Mr. Wycherly had insisted upon
after he had seen her dance under the apple-tree.

Mrs. Dew watched them drive away with great pride.

"I will say this," she said to her friend, Miss Morecraft, that
afternoon, "that when Jane-Anne’s dressed you couldn’t tell her from one
of the gentry.  She’s got something about her, my sister had it, and her
father—not as I ever cared for him—had it, too.  I think if my sister
could have seen her this afternoon she’d be set up, that I do.  He’s a
fine-looking old gentleman, too; handsome he is, and no mistake."

A good many people regarded the quaint pair with pleasure.  They were so
manifestly proud and fond of each other, and the child was so radiantly
happy.  The crowds of well-dressed people delighted her.  The garden was
beautiful, the weather perfect, and with thrills of the wildest
excitement she recognised Curly as Orlando.

When it was over, her first criticism was characteristic.  "I’d have
made a better boy than that if I’d been Rosalind; she wasn’t a bit like
a boy really, was she?  If ever I pretended to be a boy I’d try to
behave like Master Edmund, then I don’t believe anyone would rekkernise
me."

"I don’t think Shakespeare meant Rosalind to be a finished actress.  She
is a supremely lovable girl.  I don’t think we would care so much for
her if we didn’t realise the girl all the way through," Mr. Wycherly
said thoughtfully.

"Perhaps that pretty lady was right then," said Jane-Anne; "but somehow
I _think_ Rosalind would have tried to behave more like a boy."

"When you play Rosalind you shall give us a new reading of the part,"
Mr. Wycherly remarked carelessly.

Jane-Anne cuddled closely against him. "When I’m grown up," she said, "I
shall ask that Mr. Curly to take me about acting, too. How did he
begin?"

"That," Mr. Wycherly answered dreamily, "is a long story, and rather
sad.  No one wanted him to be anything of the kind——"

"But he _had_ to!" exclaimed Jane-Anne. "He just had to, something drove
him——"

"I suppose so; even yet I think it a pity."

"I don’t," Jane-Anne said decidedly.  "I’d rather go about being people
than anything—one could never be dull."

"I’m not so sure of that," said Mr. Wycherly.

For several nights now, both Bruey and "She walks in beauty like the
night" were forgotten.  Jane-Anne arose, after her aunt had taken away
the candle, to impersonate Rosalind. She rolled her thick plait round
her head and pinned it up with hairpins stolen from her aunt’s store.
She achieved doublet and hose by means of two towels, several safety
pins, and her long stockings.  And the moon looked in at the window and
was doubtless well amused.

The moon waxed and waned and the end of July was at hand.

Mr. Wycherly was plainly stirred out of his usual scholarly calm.  His
boys were coming home.  Jane-Anne shared his excitement, and even Mrs.
Dew felt it necessary to make a large cake and "to get in" quantities of
stores of every description.

Jane-Anne was strung up to the highest pitch of expectation.  Although
she had seen comparatively little of the "young gentlemen" when she
first came to Holywell, she had heard about them so much and so
constantly from the master, that she felt she, too, owned them. There
was, moreover, the delightful sense of an "understanding" with Montagu.
He had asked her to look after his guardian and she had done her best.
Moreover, quick and sympathetic always, she early realised that not even
the Greek Myths were so entrancing a subject to Mr. Wycherly as these
two boys of his, and during their walks together she invariably led the
conversation in their direction, and found it an easy and fascinating
path.

At last the great day came.  The boys were to meet in London and come
down together to Oxford by a train getting in just before tea.

At the last moment Mr. Wycherly bade Jane-Anne come with him to the
station.

She was pale with excitement and could hardly speak.

When at last the train came in and the boys, brown and jolly and full of
rejoicing at getting home, jumped on to the platform, and the first
exciting greetings had passed, Jane-Anne suddenly flung her arms round
Edmund’s neck and burst into tears upon his shoulder.

Edmund looked across the weeping damsel at his guardian in comical
dismay.  "I say," he exclaimed.  "If she does this when she meets me,
whatever will she do when we go away?"

"I beg your pardon, Master Edmund," sobbed Jane-Anne, hastily
withdrawing her arms, "but we have wanted it so, and now it’s come."

"Well, that’s nothing to cry for," Montagu said, patting her back
consolingly.  "Cheer up."

Jane-Anne dried her eyes, and the four went home in a cab laden with
luggage.

The next few days drove Mrs. Dew almost to desperation.  It was
impossible to make Jane-Anne "keep herself to herself," as that good
woman considered decorous and desirable.

Wherever the young gentlemen were, there was Jane-Anne, and it wasn’t
altogether her own fault.  They sought her out.  She fielded at
impromptu cricket matches, and discussed high subjects with Montagu.
She proudly displayed her knowledge of the Greek alphabet, and assisted
to stick in stamps in a long-neglected album.  She even confided to the
boys her misfortune with the "Magnolia Bloom," nor was she wholly
crushed by their scorn for her silliness.  _Apropos_ of this, one day,
she said:

"I wouldn’t mind so much being brown if only I had curly hair."

"The Greeks always had curly hair," Montagu announced authoritatively.
"I can’t think why you’ve been left out, ’ribbed and rippled like the
wet sea-sand,’" he quoted.

"I wonder," Edmund remarked, with a gravity that would have warned a
wiser person, "that you never wash it in beer, then it would curl like
anything."

"_Would_ it?" exclaimed Jane-Anne, in great excitement.  "Is that why
yours is so curly?"

Edmund winked at Montagu, who grinned appreciatively.  "Of course it
is," he cried; "all our chaps wash their heads in beer every Saturday,
that’s why we’ve all got such ripping hair.  Look at it."  And Edmund
thrust his head under Jane-Anne’s nose.

She ran her hand gently over the short, fair hair that was indeed
"ribbed and rippled like the wet sea-sand," then she sniffed delicately,
remarking: "I wonder it doesn’t smell of it."

"Oh, the smell soon goes off," Edmund answered airily.

"Why don’t you do it?" she asked Montagu. "Your hair’s as straight as
mine."

"He’s too slack," Edmund remarked.

"Oh, I can’t be bothered," Montagu said carelessly; "I don’t want curly
hair.  If I did I should wash it in beer."

At that moment Mr. Wycherly called the boys to go out with him, and they
rushed off leaving Jane-Anne to digest this seemingly simple specific
for curly hair.

Reflection unfollowed by action was impossible to Jane-Anne.

The beds were made.  Her share of the dusting was done.  The boys and
Mr. Wycherly would be out until luncheon, and her aunt was busy in the
kitchen where she strongly objected to have Jane-Anne, as she described
it, "clutterin’ round."

There was a large cask of beer in the cellar, and the key was in the
door.  The cellar was to the front of the house under the dining-room,
and was consequently some distance from the kitchen.

Jane-Anne rushed upstairs, seized her large bedroom jug, emptied it, and
descended with it to the cellar.

The cask was near the steps, and, with the door at the top left open,
she could see quite well.  She turned the tap and the good brown ale
foamed gaily into the jug.

Just as, by its weight, she judged it to be about half full, she heard a
sound as though her aunt were coming.

She seized her jug and rushed up the steps, forgetting to shut the door
at the top, and hid in the parlour.  No, she was wrong, Mrs. Dew was
still busy in the kitchen.

As quietly as she could, she crept back to her room, and, once there,
bolted the door.

Her heart was thumping in her ears, and she panted with excitement.

She had a good large basin in her room and a foot-bath.  She chose the
foot-bath and what was in the jug filled it half full of the strong
brown ale of Oxford.

What a smell it had!

Jane-Anne knelt down, unplaited her hair and shook it forward over her
face.  She held her nose tightly with one hand and with the other
plunged her heavy mane into the foaming beer. The smell was
overpowering.  She was obliged to let go of her nose for she was
choking, and as she did so the beer, forced higher in the foot-bath by
the mass of hair, splashed her in the face.

Gasping and choking, she persevered; she laved her head with beer, she
rubbed it in with both hands, rejoicing that it made a beautiful lather,
and she spat out vigorously what had been forced into her open mouth
while she held her nose.

It was a horrible experience, but the blood of the Spartans ran in
Jane-Anne’s veins, and she endured till every hair and a large
proportion of her upper garments was thoroughly saturated with beer.

At last she felt the treatment had had full justice, and she drew out
what appeared to be yards of sticky, sodden pulp that had once been
human hair.

"Of course it won’t curl till it’s dry," she said to herself, and
proceeded to sprinkle more beer about her bedroom in her efforts to free
her hair from that nourishing beverage.

But it wouldn’t dry.

Her bedroom already smelt like ten public-houses rolled into one, and
brown stains were everywhere.

Not a ripple nor a rib appeared on her matted and bedraggled head.

Her towels were already saturated with beer, and only seemed to make
matters worse.

Her eyes smarted and her nose was scarlet. The strong smell made her
feel quite faint.

She began to cry bitterly; her hair was stickier than ever and showed no
signs of even waving.

In her ardent pursuit of beauty she had forgotten that explanation would
be necessary, and what explanation would be possible in the face of all
these stains and this terrific smell? She hung her head out of the
window and it dripped into the stone-cutter’s yard.

A man passed underneath, sniffed, and looked up; all he saw was a wet
mass of something that dripped beer.  "Waste o’ good liquor," he
muttered, and passed on.

Jane-Anne was getting desperate when there came a rattling of the handle
of her door, a hasty push against it, then a tremendous knocking and
Edmund’s voice:

"Are you there, Jane-Anne?"

"Yes," in a muffled sniff.

"What are you doing?  Come out."

"I can’t."

"Well, let me in, then.  I want to speak to you."

"I daren’t."

"Oh, nonsense, let me in quick, I say, I’ve something important to tell
you."

Curiosity was too strong in her to resist this. She opened the door,
hiding herself behind it as she did so.

"Good gracious!" exclaimed Edmund.  "It’s here, too."

Then, as he saw the foot-bath on the floor, the beery stains everywhere,
and lastly, the distracted figure behind the door shrouded in sticky
locks that still dripped beer, he subsided upon the bed in fits of
laughter.

Jane-Anne banged the door, bolted it, and faced him indignantly.

"Why are you laughing?" she demanded.

"You’ve never gone and done it really—well, you _are_ the simplest
juggins."

"D’you mean," Jane-Anne demanded sternly, "that it _doesn’t_ make hair
curl?"

"Not that I know of," gurgled the perjured boy; "it may," and relapsing
into howls of mirth he buried his face in her pillow to stifle them.

Jane-Anne clasped her beery hands and wrung them.  "And I’ve endured all
this for nothing," she cried indignantly.

"And wasted a whole cask of beer," Edmund continued.  "You left it
running, and the cellar’s flooded and you can smell us half-way down the
street; there’s quite a little crowd outside," he announced gleefully.

"I wish I was dead," she moaned.

"I’d have a bath if I were you, quick," said Edmund.  "If you’re safe in
there, locked in, no one can get at you.  Mrs. Dew and Montagu and
Guardie are all at the cellar.  Montagu’s wading about in it, scooping
it up, and I want to go too, only I thought it would be mean not to
fetch you——"

"You can’t be meaner than you’ve been already," she cried angrily.  "Why
did you tell me such a lie?"

"Nonsense like that isn’t lies," Edmund answered, angry in his turn.
"It’s chaff.  I never dreamt you’d be such a fool as to go and do it."

"Is it really no use?" she pleaded, still clinging fondly even yet to
the hope that all might not have been in vain.

Edmund looked at her and began to laugh again.




                             *CHAPTER XVII*

                       *THE PHILOSOPHY OF EFFORT*

"A man’s fortunes are the fruits of his character."  RALPH WALDO
EMERSON.


When one has passed fifty, four years—provided no one of them brings
severe illness or great sorrow—make little if any difference in outward
appearance.  Time is usually kind to the middle-aged, and it is only
when we reach middle-age ourselves, and the dear old landmarks are
removed one by one, that we realise how much we unconsciously depended
on this stability of appearance, this changelessness in those who helped
to shape our destiny.

Thus if there was little change in Mrs. Dew and Mr. Wycherly four years
after Jane-Anne had flooded the Holywell cellar with beer, Jane-Anne
herself and the boys looked back upon the children of that time with a
kind of affectionate scorn.

Montagu was now taller than Mr. Wycherly, thin-faced and analytic as
ever, only waiting for the following October to take up his scholarship
at New College.

Edmund was on the _Britannia_, all uniform and gold buttons, naval
phrases, and nonsense.  When he appeared for his "leaves" (he scorned to
call it holidays) he imported so much liveliness and laughter, to say
nothing of visitors from the outer world, into the quiet household that
during these hilarious weeks Jane-Anne forgot to be earnest.

For Jane-Anne was very earnest.

Four years of school-life had wrought great changes in Jane-Anne.

For one thing, no one any longer had to worry about her lungs.
Crepitations were things of the past.  She was strong as a Shetland pony
with fully as much endurance.

There was nothing in her physique to prevent her becoming a most
efficient housemaid. Moreover, she was tall enough for even the most
exacting situation.  But even Mrs. Dew had ceased to include that idea
among practical politics.

For Jane-Anne had turned out "clever at her books" beyond all
expectation.  She went first of all to a nice school over Magdalen
Bridge, but she got on so fast and was so unusually receptive a pupil
that the head mistress herself called upon Mr. Wycherly and suggested
that Jane-Anne should go on to the High School.  Mr. Wycherly consulted
Lord Dursley, who still continued to take a vicarious sort of interest
in the child, and the matter was arranged without much difficulty.

Here Jane-Anne fell under the influence of Miss Willows and became
strenuous and earnest to the last degree.

Miss Willows taught the top form, and she did more than teach it, she
moulded it.

She was twenty-eight years old and was fully determined to be a head
mistress herself before many years had passed.  She was of the stuff
head mistresses are made and she was modern of the moderns.  She was
tall and strong and handsome, good at games and a first in classics, and
hers was indeed the doctrine of perfection.

"Don’t only try to do things as well as other people," she would say;
"try to do them a little better.  Never be content with mediocrity."

Courage and strength were her watchwords and her ambition was that her
girls should go forth into the world not to be shielded from temptation
but armed to withstand it.  Silliness she abhorred, and, satisfactory
pupil as Jane-Anne was, she was thankful that Miss Willows could not, as
she put it, "see inside her," for Jane-Anne was conscious that she
frequently lapsed from grace, was often frankly and unashamedly silly
and enjoyed it.

Miss Willows was always beautifully dressed, and taught her girls to
care a good deal about their clothes.  She was sarcastic, and the clumsy
and untidy trembled before her.

Jane-Anne never trembled.  She admired and adored and perhaps "inside"
she was a little afraid of her, but outwardly she was quite fearless,
and Miss Willows respected her in consequence.  Even more did she
respect the girl’s quite extraordinary command of English and her
familiarity with schools of philosophy that were to most of the class
mere names.

Miss Willows had settled Jane-Anne’s career. She was to go on to one of
the women’s colleges and then she was to teach.  It was her plain duty.
Jane-Anne said nothing, seemed to acquiesce in all these wise and
benevolent plans on her behalf, and all the time dreamed dreams and saw
visions of something very different indeed.

She had not wavered in her allegiance to Lord Byron.  He was still her
hero, and she stoutly refused to displace him by Mr. Robert Browning,
who was the chosen prophet of Miss Willows.

"Lord Byron is so obvious," that lady said one day, when she had found
fault with a quotation from "Childe Harold" that Jane-Anne had dragged
into an essay.

"It is impossible to misunderstand what he means," Jane-Anne said
quickly, ever ready to take up arms on behalf of "her oldest friend," as
she called him.

"He is not subtle," Miss Willows continued.

"He is never obscure, never unmusical," quoth Jane-Anne.

"I am sorry," Miss Willows said gravely, "that you make such a hero of
Lord Byron, the more so, that, from what I can make out, you do not do
so in ignorance of his character. You say you have read his life?"

"Years ago."

Miss Willows made a point of never being shocked at anything her girls
might say—to be shocked showed weakness.  Nevertheless, she rather
wondered what Mr. Wycherly could have been about to allow such a thing.
And there was a black mark against him in her mind.

Curiously enough, it was Mr. Wycherly himself who first aroused
Jane-Anne to any enthusiasm for the works of Robert Browning, and it
came about in this way.

She still passionately desired curly hair.  It was the desire of the
moth for the star, for her hair remained obstinately straight.  That it
was beautiful in colour, texture and abundance, did not comfort her; it
was straight, uncompromisingly straight, though it maintained its
upward, outward sweep round her broad, low forehead.

Mr. Wycherly thought it was hard for Jane-Anne to have no money, and
insisted on paying her five shillings a month for waiting upon him.  Out
of this, her aunt insisted that she must keep herself in stockings and
gloves, which the child faithfully did.

But a girl at school enlightened her as to the uses of curling tongs,
and Jane-Anne succumbed to temptation.  She borrowed the goffering
irons, heated them in the kitchen fire and burnt both her hair and her
forehead rather badly.

Mr. Wycherly was infinitely more distressed about this than over the
beer episode and took her gently to task for trying to improve upon what
Nature had already made so harmonious and pleasing to the eye.

That was the way to get at Jane-Anne.  As always, she was perfectly
frank with him.

"Miss Willows says it is the duty of everyone to look as pretty as
possible.  ’Do your best and then think nothing more about it,’ she
says.  But I seem obliged to think about it. You see, I _know_ I’d be so
much nicer if my hair was frizzy."

"But I don’t think you would," Mr. Wycherly argued.  "Your type is
severe and classical; ’frizziness’ would be quite dreadful and
incongruous."

"But could _anyone_ be beautiful with straight hair?"

"Why not?"

"Lord Byron had wavy hair, _you_ have wavy hair, all the goddesses and
people and Helen of Troy had wavy hair."

"I assure you," Mr. Wycherly declared, absently passing a long, slender
hand over his thick white locks, "I never think about my hair at all,
except when I have to go and get it cut."

"You never think about it, my dear, because you are so sure it is all
right.  You _know_ you are a most beautiful old person and that people
must admire you if they looked at you at all, _therefore_ you can afford
not to think about it."

"My dear Jane-Anne, you are talking nonsense."

"I’m not; really, truly, not.  I often see people look at you in the
street and I often hear them say nice things——"

"Good heavens," cried Mr. Wycherly, "how dreadful!"

"I shouldn’t think it a bit dreadful if they said such things about me,"
Jane-Anne said, "but they don’t yet—not often."

"Do they ever?" Mr. Wycherly asked anxiously.

"If I told you, you would say it was impertinent, so I won’t tell you,
dear master."

"Will you promise me to let your hair alone?"

"If I promise, I should have to," Jane-Anne said doubtfully.

"That’s why I want you to promise."

"Will a year do?" pleaded Jane-Anne.

"Three years," Mr. Wycherly maintained.

Jane-Anne sighed deeply.  "Well, I promise—but if at the end of that
time I find something that will really truly make it curl, without
smelling horrible or burning or spoiling it——"

"Three years will do," said Mr. Wycherly.

That evening when she went to say good-night to him he read her "A
Face," by Robert Browning.

    "If one could have that little head of hers
    Painted upon a background of pure gold...."


Jane-Anne listened, breathless, charmed. When he had finished he turned
to her:

"That always makes me think of you, and I wish I could have you painted
so.  But you wouldn’t be a bit like it if you had different hair."

Jane-Anne was silent for nearly two minutes; then she said thoughtfully:

"I rather like Browning’s poetry after all. I’ll quote a bit in my next
scripture just to please Miss Willows."

At first her position in the school was something of an anomaly.  Her
exceptional ability and her fleetness of foot gave her an assured place
in the school work and games at once. Her personal appearance and her
eager charm brought her friends.  Then one of the girls, who had asked
her to tea, a girl living in a large house in the Woodstock Road, whose
people had nothing whatever to do with any of the colleges, discovered
that she was no relation to the old gentleman in whose house she lived
and that her aunt was his servant.

The girl was horrified, told every girl she could get to listen, and
always concluded the harangue with the remark: "We all know the school’s
mixed enough, but it’s getting a bit too much when they take the
daughters of domestic servants.  Someone ought to write and complain."

She forthwith cut Jane-Anne, as did several others.  Jane-Anne was
puzzled, then angry, and finally forced the girl to explain her conduct
in the playground.

"Your aunt’s his servant," the girl concluded, "and we don’t like it."

"I’m his servant, too," Jane-Anne said haughtily, "and I’d rather be his
servant than your friend any day."

"You won’t have much chance of being that," the girl said angrily.  "I
wouldn’t be seen with you for the world."

"The whole of Oxford," cried Jane-Anne, "can see me with him, and he’s a
great gentleman and a scholar; and you—you’re a carroty-haired, ill-bred
little nobody who can’t write a French exercise without getting somebody
else to do half of it."

The school took sides, and the best and cleverest half finally sided
with Jane-Anne.  She never told anybody but Montagu what she had gone
through, but whenever any new girl made friendly advances Jane-Anne took
care to inform her that Mrs. Dew, Mr. Wycherly’s housekeeper, was her
aunt, that she loved her and wasn’t in the least ashamed of it.  "And
now," she always concluded, "you can go on being friends with me or not,
just as you choose."

The girls were friendly enough in school, but she knew very few of them
at home.  Those she did know were nearly all friends of Mrs. Methuen and
girls whose position was assured.  Thus it happened that Jane-Anne’s few
friends were the nicest girls in the school.  But she had very little
time for friendship.  She still helped her aunt in the house as much as
ever she could. She had really hard and heavy homework to prepare—only
her extraordinary quickness got her through it in the time she allowed
for it, and she was, moreover, always to the fore if any play or
recitation or fancy dancing was toward.  She was so easily and far
beyond any other girl in things of that sort that she could never be
spared.  The dancing-class was her greatest joy.  Mr. Wycherly had
insisted on her learning to dance whenever she went to school.  He paid
the fees himself, and sometimes even braved the phalanx of girls at the
class in order to go himself and see her dance.

And once a year Curly came with his company and acted in the Oxford
Theatre.  Mr. Wycherly always took Jane-Anne and Curly always came to
see them in Holywell, and every time he came he asked Mr. Wycherly the
same question: "Well, and have you settled yet what she is to be?"

"She talks," said Mr. Wycherly, "of being a teacher of dancing—but it
seems to me that in that case her education is rather thrown away."

"A teacher of dancing!" Curly repeated ironically.  "I think I see her
teaching dancing for long."

"She came to me last night," Mr. Wycherly continued, as though he had
not heard, "and asked abruptly, ’Do you think one can serve God and
dance for a living?’"

"Ah," said Curly, "that’s a different thing; and what did you say, sir?"

"I fear," said Mr. Wycherly humbly, "that I made no very definite
answer."

"I should like to know what you think," Curly persisted.  "You consider
dancing to be one of the beautiful and delightful arts?"

"I do."

"And in Jane-Anne that art finds the subtlest and most delicate
expression?"

Mr. Wycherly groaned.

"Why should she not serve God as well in that way as in any other?"

"Because," said Mr. Wycherly haughtily, "I should dislike it extremely."

Curly laughed.

"I have an idea," he said, "that Miss Allegra Stavrides will find
another mode of expressing the artist that is in her."

Mr. Wycherly groaned again.  "She is so young," he said; "why should she
be anything at all for years and years?"

"Because," said Curly, "the race is to the swift, and the child is very
fleet of foot."

"You will not, promise me you will not, say or do anything to put such
an idea into her head," Mr. Wycherly pleaded.

"My dear old friend, the idea has been there for years—and it is quite
possible it may come to nothing."

But though Curly spake comfortable words there was no conviction in his
voice.




                            *CHAPTER XVIII*

                             *GANTRY BILL*

    "Oh, why are eyes of hazel? noses Grecian!
      I’ve lost my rest at night, my peace by day,
    For want of some brown holland or Venetian,
      Over the way."
        TOM HOOD


Old Holywell in Oxford town is an interesting street.  Not only does
every house there differ from its neighbour, but the inhabitants are
just as varied.

Opposite Mr. Wycherly’s was a tall, straight, grey house, which had been
let as rooms to generations of undergraduates when the time came for
them to "live out."  Some two years before, Jane-Anne had watched these
young gentlemen, as she then still called them, with the greatest
interest; in fact, undergraduates as a class held for her one supreme
possibility—one of them might fulfil in the flesh all she had dreamed in
the spirit of Lord Byron.

She had never met one that in the least resembled her dream.  They were,
for the most part, broad-shouldered, brown-faced, exceedingly untidy
young men, who slouched about Oxford in ancient Norfolk jackets, baggy
grey flannel trousers, and slippers down at the heel. Most of them
looked in the best of health and spirits.  The few who might, perhaps,
be suspected of soulfulness were so plain-looking, that she dismissed
them at once; they were out of the running altogether.

Montagu was good-looking in a straight-featured, quiet sort of way.
Edmund was radiantly and riotously handsome.  Mr. Wycherly, in
Jane-Anne’s opinion and that of several other people, was the most
beautiful person in Oxford. Therefore she was hard to please.

After she came under the influence of Miss Willows, young men interested
her no more. True to her theory that every eventuality should be met
fearlessly, Miss Willows never omitted the possibility of marriage from
talks with her girls.  With her, they regarded it as a rather
commonplace fate, that might perhaps fall to the lot of some of them.
But there were many more interesting things in life than that.

Miss Willows never, by word or look, hinted to her girls that young men
were dangerous, and therefore to be avoided.  They were there in Oxford
in large numbers, let the girls meet them in society if possible, let
them judge of them dispassionately.  Let there be no glamour of the
forbidden about them.  They might talk to them; listen to them; weigh
their conversation in the balance of reason, and—she always added
inwardly—"find it wanting."  But she never said this; she implied it,
and the girls, with youthful earnestness and scorn, finished the
sentence for themselves.

Jane-Anne met no young men.  Every undergraduate at New College knew Mr.
Wycherly by sight, but not one knew any more of him. At the time when
Jane-Anne took an interest in them they took no sort of interest in her.
Now that she was tall and straight, with frocks down to her ankles, and
bright eyes that rained influence, a good many undergraduates wished
they knew Mr. Wycherly.  As for Jane-Anne, she desired no notice from
foolish young men. The notice she craved was larger and more impersonal,
and although she was an impatient young person, she was content to wait
for it. She knew that she was not wasting her time. She studied Greek
dramatists with Mr. Wycherly, and read eagerly every word of his
translation of Aristotle’s "Poetics," laying to heart many of its
maxims.  She walked to and from school by herself, she went on
occasional errands for Mrs. Dew, but beyond that she was rarely seen in
Oxford except accompanied by Mr. Wycherly.  With him she wandered in
college gardens, and by the banks of the Cherwell.  When the boys came
back, she spent long days on the river with them, and every new dance
she learned at school she danced again for "the master," and in summer
always danced barefooted on the lawn.

Mr. Wycherly allowed her to do her evening work in the parlour, which
was quieter than the housekeeper’s room in such close proximity to Mrs.
Dew.  The May nights were hot, and Jane-Anne opened the window and drew
back the short white curtains to let in as much air as possible.  People
might look in if they liked. It mattered nothing to Jane-Anne, loftily
absorbed in work for Miss Willows.

There she sat at the round, rosewood table in the middle of the room,
the electric light shaded and drawn low over her papers (Mr. Wycherly
never allowed her to work in a bad light), her delicate Greek profile
presented to every chance observer, severe, detached, an example of
studious girlhood most edifying to behold.

So evidently thought the undergraduate who lived opposite.  For no
sooner had she turned on her light than he extinguished his and took a
seat in the window, which, a little above the level of hers, commanded
an excellent view of Mr. Wycherly’s parlour.  His watch was shared by a
white bull terrier, who spent long hours sitting on the sill.

That undergraduate was a rowing man, the Eights came on in another
fortnight, and in the evenings he "did a slack."

He was musical, this undergraduate, possessed a piano and a pleasing
tenor voice, and sometimes after dinner, although Jane-Anne would not
have dreamed of interrupting her work for one instant to listen, she was
vaguely conscious that the music was agreeable, and was sorry when it
ceased.

One evening, however, she did listen, for there came from the house
opposite strains that were, to her, curiously familiar; a queer,
old-fashioned song, and then with a little leap of the heart she
recognised a poem she knew and loved.  The young man opposite had
evidently been well taught, it was quite possible to hear his words. She
stopped short in the middle of a complicated sentence to the effect that
the aim of discipline is to produce a self-governing unit, laid down her
pen, and, forgetful that the light was behind her, went to the window
and leaned out.

The young man seated at the piano in the darkness of the room opposite
smiled gleefully, and sang more loudly and with increased fervour:

    "By those tresses unconfined
    Woo’d by each Ægean wind;
    By those lids whose jetty fringe
    Kiss thy soft cheek’s blooming tinge;
    By those soft eyes like the roe ..."


Then followed the passionate Greek invocation with which each line of
Byron’s "Maid of Athens" concludes.

Miss Willows would doubtless have dismissed words and music as hackneyed
and obvious. But her pupil had read the verses till she knew them by
heart, feeling, as in the case of "She walks in beauty like the night,"
that Lord Byron had written them for her and about her; she had not
heard them sung since her mother sang them to her when she was a very
little child.  Now in the soft spring night the once familiar strains
came floating across the quiet street charged full of innocent and
tender memories.

In the semi-darkness, Jane-Anne beheld a ghostly white dog, seated
solemn and sedate on the window-ledge.  The dog also noticed Jane-Anne,
and while his master still passionately proclaimed the fact that his
heart had passed into the possession of "The Maid of Athens," the dog
pricked forward his long ears, after the fashion of a bull-terrier when
interested, and wagged his tail.  At that instant the music ceased with
a crash of chords.

"Oh, you dear!" exclaimed Jane-Anne, and went back to her work.

The singer came and sat in the window again.

"Gantry Bill," he said softly, "which of us did she call a dear?"

Gantry Bill wagged his tail again.

_He_ hadn’t the smallest doubt.

"That seemed to fetch her rather," the singer continued.

Gantry Bill evidently thought this a foolish remark, for he made no
response.

"It’s a shame to make such a pretty girl work so hard, ain’t it, Bill?"

Here Gantry Bill was more sympathetic, and tried to lick his master’s
face.

"We’ll try another," said that gentleman, "we’ll fetch her again, won’t
us, Bill?"

But he sang the most passionate love songs in his repertoire, apparently
to deaf ears.  The little head, with its cameo-like profile and dark
wealth of hair, remained studiously bent under the shaded light.  The
self-governing unit had triumphed.

Her opposite neighbour might shout himself hoarse for all she cared.
She wanted full marks and a "plus" for her essay.

Night after night that week from the house opposite a tenor voice
apostrophised some peerless she.  But never again did Jane-Anne go to
the window, and Gantry Bill laid his head sideways on his paws, his ears
flopped forwards, and snored gently, while his master, at the top of his
voice, proclaimed "the thousand beauties that he knew so well."

He was a patient dog, Gantry Bill.  More patient than his master who,
by-and-bye, gave it up as a bad job—and went out.  He occasionally
attended lectures, too, whither the dog could not accompany him.  Then
would Bill sit on the window-ledge watching the passers-by with a wise
reflective air, or sleep in that pathetic abandonment of attitude
habitual to the bull-terrier.

Jane-Anne sometimes crossed the street, spoke to him, caressed him, and
peeped into the empty room behind—a most untidy room.

"Poor doggie," she said, one Saturday afternoon, "alone so much; would
you like to come and play in our garden, Gantry Bill?  It’s much cooler
than over here.  The master’s out, and you’ll not bother anybody."

Gantry Bill looked at her, and evidently was tempted.  In fact, a pretty
girl in a white frock on a hot July afternoon is always a pleasing
apparition.

Very slowly, like a stiff old gentleman, Gantry Bill arose and stood on
the window-ledge. He smiled at Jane-Anne, and playfully took her hand
into his mouth and mumbled it, in token of his approval.

"He’s gone to the boats, he’ll be hours and hours," she said.  "I saw
him rushing up the street in those awful little short knickerbockers,
and you left all alone to mope, poor dear! Why shouldn’t you have a
little amusement, too?"

This appeared a sound argument.  Gantry Bill dropped from the
window-ledge into the street, and followed Jane-Anne across the road.
Into the garden she took him by devious ways that did not challenge the
observation of Mrs. Dew.  She fetched him water in a pie-dish and
presented him with a chocolate biscuit, then she sat down under the
apple-tree to mend her stockings.  But Gantry Bill hadn’t come out for
the afternoon to watch people mend stockings.

He spied a hockey ball lying on the path, seized it in his mouth, and
galumphed heavily towards Jane-Anne, laid it at her feet, barked and
made a series of short rushes at her in token that he desired to play.

"Hush," said Jane-Anne, holding up a needle in her finger and thumb,
"you mustn’t bark, else aunt’ll hear you and come out. What do you
want?"

Another short rush, another "wouf," and an eager head, ears cocked
forward, eyes beseeching Jane-Anne.

"You want me to throw it, do you?"

This was exactly what Gantry Bill did want, and for twenty minutes he
kept Jane-Anne very busy indeed.  Then, hot and exhausted, they both sat
down under the apple-tree, and she was permitted to mend her stocking.
This was the first of many meetings.

Gantry Bill’s master had no idea his dog made assignations with the
young lady of the Greek profile and the long, thick pig-tail. Otherwise
he would have insisted upon an introduction.  She showed no signs of
playing Eurydice to his Orpheus, sang he never so. None of his pals knew
Mr. Wycherly, and Mr. Wycherly’s friends in Oxford he did not know; and
just because the thing seemed so impossible he ardently desired to meet
Jane-Anne, and he had never wanted much to know any girl before.  He was
not a ladies’ man.

After all, it was Gantry Bill who brought the thing about.

Mrs. Dew was very particular about eggs. Shop eggs she declined to use
even for the "egg and bread crumb" of fish, and all eggs in Holywell
came from an old woman who lived on the Iffley Road, kept large numbers
of fowls, and sold her eggs to a chosen few who would fetch them.

It was one of Jane-Anne’s duties to fetch eggs twice a week.  It
happened, however, that Mrs. Dew "ran short" one day when she
particularly wanted to make an omelette for Mr. Wycherly’s dinner.  So
after tea she sent Jane-Anne, with a shilling tucked into her glove, to
bring the required eggs.  Jane-Anne walked quickly and procured the eggs
without adventure of any kind, carrying them in a little round basket
shaped like the hilt of a single-stick.

It was hot, and on her return she walked more slowly, dreaming as she
went.  She held the basket rather loosely in one hand, and was quite
unprepared when a heavy body bounced at her from behind and knocked her
over. The basket flew from her hand, the eggs were scattered and
smashed; and much startled and confused she felt two strong hands under
her armpits that raised her to her feet, while a penitent voice
exclaimed:

"I say, I am most awfully sorry; it’s that brute of a dog.  I can’t
think what possessed him to bounce at you like that.  He’s never done it
before to anybody.  I do _hope_ you’re not hurt or very frightened.
Down, sir! Down, you brute!  You shall have a good thrashing for this."

Jane-Anne recovered her senses to perceive that a tall young man, in a
blazer and white flannel trousers, had picked her up, that two other
young men stood by, looking rather amused, and that Gantry Bill was
cringing at her feet in evident expectation of the beating his master
had promised him, while round about them the broken eggs were drawing
maps upon the dusty road.

"Please don’t beat him," she said, hastily settling her hat, which had
been knocked over her nose.  "He didn’t mean to knock me down; he was
only saying how-do-you-do.  He’s a great friend of mine, really."

"Lucky beggar," said the young man; "but I don’t see why he should show
his friendship in such an inconvenient fashion.  He must be a tremendous
weight to knock you down like that."

The two other young men had discreetly strolled on.  Jane-Anne, Gantry
Bill and his master stood in the road encircled by broken eggs, and
looked at one another.  Jane-Anne saw a tall, broad-shouldered young man
with a brown face, a very clean brown face that had once been fair.  He
was not handsome—his nose was too broad and his mouth too big; but he
had splendid strong white teeth and merry blue eyes, which, at that
moment, looked into her own full of contrition and commiseration.

"I think," he added hastily, "that we are neighbours; don’t you live
opposite?"

"That’s how I knew your dog," Jane-Anne explained.  "You leave him alone
a great deal."

"I can’t take him to lectures."

"I’m sure he’d behave very well.  But, as I was saying, you leave him
alone and I was sorry for him, and so he sometimes comes and visits me,
and we’re great friends, aren’t we, Gantry Bill?"

"You know his name?" the young man exclaimed.

"Of course.  I’m not deaf, and the street is not wide.  Oh, dear!
whatever shall I do about the eggs?"

"Where did you get them, and we’ll go and get some more?"

"But I haven’t any more money, and we always pay for them."

"Of course, you must allow me to pay for them.  My dog broke them."

"If you wouldn’t mind—just for to-day. You see, if I don’t take them
back aunt couldn’t make an omelette for Mr. Wycherly’s dinner."

"Let’s go and get them at once.  We can get them at the nearest
grocer’s."

"Oh, you needn’t trouble to come with me.  I must go back, for aunt
won’t get eggs anywhere else.  If you could lend me the shilling——"

"I’m going to carry those eggs, and see you safe home.  You might feel
faint or something after such a shock."

Jane-Anne laughed, but she did not forbid him to accompany her.  Gantry
Bill gambolled on ahead, and together they bought another shilling’s
worth of eggs from Mrs. Dew’s old woman.

As they walked down the Iffley Road together, he said rather
diffidently: "Gantry Bill is more fortunate than his master, since he
seems to know you, Miss Wycherly."

"My name’s not Wycherly," Jane-Anne answered.  "It’s Stavrides.  I’m no
relation to Mr. Wycherly; my aunt is his housekeeper, and he lets me
live there.  I love him dearly."

"My name’s George Gordon."

"Oh!" she exclaimed.  "Are you any relation to Lord Byron?"

"Certainly not, I’m glad to say," he remarked decidedly.  "We’re quite
another lot of Gordons.  It’s a big clan, you know.  We’re the
Dumfrieshire Gordons.  The poet was a gloomy sort of chap, wasn’t he?"

Jane-Anne stood still, and gazed at the Gordon at her side with great
indignation.

"Gloomy," she repeated; "sad, if you like, sometimes, but very witty and
amusing; have you read his letters?"

George Gordon hung his head; the brown eyes looking up into his were so
grave and accusing.

"I’m afraid I know very little about him," he said humbly; "perhaps he
was an ancestor of yours—I’m awfully sorry——"

Again Jane-Anne laughed, and he thought she had the prettiest laugh.
"Do you only defend people when they are your relations?" she asked.  "I
admire Lord Byron’s poetry, and I am grateful to him because he gave his
life for my country—but he’s not the least little bit of an ancestor.  I
don’t think I’ve got any."

"That must be rather jolly, because then you can play off your own bat,
and people aren’t always expecting things of you because your
great-great-uncle did something or other last century."

"Oh, I’d like them if I’d got them," she said; "but as I haven’t—it’s no
use fretting.  Have you a great many?"

"Nothing to speak of," he said, blushing. "I can’t think how we’ve got
on to such a footling subject.  You like Gantry Bill, don’t you?"

"He’s a perfect dear, but why is he called Gantry Bill?  What’s gantry
mean—I looked it up in the dictionary, and it says——"

"Oh, it’s nothing to do with that—it’s some soldiers’ lingo—he belonged
to my elder brother; he’s a gunner and he had to go to Nigeria and
couldn’t take him, so he gave him to me.  He’s a faithful beast, and
understands every word you say to him."

By this time they had reached Long Wall, and as they strolled along in
intimate converse they met Miss Willows, who looked hard at Jane-Anne
and her escort carrying the basket of eggs.

When they reached the archway leading into the builder’s yard, Jane-Anne
stopped and bade him farewell.

"I can’t pay you the shilling now," she said, "for I haven’t got one,
but the minute I have one I’ll bring it over.  I’ve spent my allowance
for this month already."

"Oh, please," he said, looking most unhappy; "please don’t speak of it.
I broke the eggs, at least Bill did—so, of course——"

"Good-bye," said Jane-Anne, and vanished in at the side-door.

George Gordon crossed the road very slowly, with Gantry Bill following
sedately at his heels; when they reached his sitting-room he sank
heavily into the chair by the window, and the bull-terrier leapt up on
to his seat on the window-sill.

"I say, Bill," his master asked, "how have you contrived to see so much
of her?"

The shilling weighed heavily on Jane-Anne’s mind.  She could not repay
it herself, for she had spent four-and-elevenpence-halfpenny on the
first of May, the day she got her allowance, on a pair of black silk
stockings declared to be "half-price," which she had greatly coveted to
dance in.

Mrs. Dew would undoubtedly repay the shilling, but she would, at the
same time, ask so many questions and comment so severely on Jane-Anne’s
carelessness, and (this was what Jane-Anne particularly dreaded) express
such horror at her "forwardness" in walking home with George Gordon,
that Jane-Anne simply could not summon up enough moral courage to
confess herself to her aunt.

Therefore, as had happened hundreds of times in the past, there was
nothing for it but to go to "the master" who would, she knew, get her
out of the difficulty, and ask no questions.  Yet—she felt shy even of
the master.

Suppose he forbade her ever to speak to George Gordon or Gantry Bill
again?

Still, the shilling must be got back to George Gordon that night, and it
was already seven o’clock, time for her to lay dinner.  She ran up to
Mr. Wycherly’s study, and found him sitting in his arm-chair by the
window reading Horace.

She went and stood before his chair, clasped her hands behind her, and
announced:

"I broke a whole basketful of eggs, sir, this afternoon.  They cost a
shilling."

"Do you think," said Mr. Wycherly, smiling, "that the domestic exchequer
will stand such a heavy drain upon it?"

"But that’s not all," she continued breathlessly. "He picked me up, and
as I hadn’t another shilling he paid for the eggs, and I’ve spent all my
money, and can’t pay him back till June.  Will you lend me the money to
pay him?"

Mr. Wycherly no longer lounged in his chair. He sat up very straight,
but he spoke gently as usual, saying:

"Do you mind explaining to me who ’he’ is, and why you should need to be
picked up?"

"Gantry Bill, that’s his dog, bounced at me from behind; we’re great
friends and he was glad to see me, and I was thinking deeply, and he
knocked me over and the eggs flew all about and made a great mess, so he
helped me up and we went together to buy more eggs, and he carried them
home for me."

"Gantry Bill, as you call him," Mr. Wycherly said, his eyes twinkling,
"seems a very remarkable dog.  First, he knocks you down, then he picks
you up and gives you a shilling to buy eggs, which he politely carries
home for you. Is it this intelligent animal that you propose to repay?"

"No," said Jane-Anne, blushing hotly; "it’s the intelligent animal’s
master.  He lives just opposite.  He’s at New College."

"And is it he who is such a great friend of yours?" Mr. Wycherly asked,
as though it were the most natural conclusion possible.

"No," said Jane-Anne, rosier than ever; "I never spoke to him before,
though I knew him by sight.  He’s rather nice," she added; "his name is
George Gordon, but he’s no relation to dear Lord Byron—and he doesn’t
seem a bit sorry.  May I take the shilling over?"

"I think," said Mr. Wycherly, "that perhaps it would be better if I took
him the shilling myself.  After all, you know, the eggs were for the
house, and therefore my affair."

"Oh, would you?" cried Jane-Anne.  "That is perfectly lovely of you, and
then you’ll see him, and see if you like him."

"Exactly," said Mr. Wycherly, "that’s why I want to go."

"You will give it back to-night, won’t you?" she begged.

"Directly after dinner; I hope he will be at home."

"Oh, he’s sure to be at home," she said simply.  "He generally sings
then; I hear him while I’m working.  He sings ’Maid of Athens’ most
beautifully."

"Does he indeed?" said Mr. Wycherly.




                             *CHAPTER XIX*

                       *THE STARLING FLIES AWAY*

    "What is to come we know not.  But we know
    That what has been was good....
    Let the great winds their worst and wildest blow,
    Or the gold weather round us mellow slow:
    We have fulfilled ourselves, and we can dare
    And we can conquer, though we may not share
    In the rich quiet of the afterglow
    What is to come."
      W. E. HENLEY.


While Mr. Wycherly was still sitting over his port, Mrs. Dew brought him
a note that had come by hand.  He opened it, and found that it was from
Miss Willows. Now, Mr. Wycherly knew very little of Miss Willows.  She
had, it is true, been to tea with Jane-Anne on two occasions, when the
child had implored him to be present.  Of course, Jane-Anne was dying to
"show him" to Miss Willows.  That lady felt his charm, but she doubted
whether he was a very safe or suitable guardian for so unusual a girl.
What she had seen that afternoon convinced her that her doubts were
justified, and she felt that not a moment must be lost.  It was
necessary to awake in him a sense of his responsibilities, therefore she
wrote:


"DEAR MR. WYCHERLY,

"I feel sure you will acquit me of any desire to be fussily interfering
if I venture to ask whether it is with your knowledge and approval that
Jane-Anne walks with undergraduates in the evening after tea.  I hope
you know me too well to imagine that any foolish prudery or even an
exaggerated sense of the importance of Mrs. Grundy’s opinion causes me
to bring the subject before you.  It is only that while Jane-Anne is so
young, while she is working so hard, it would be wiser, I think, to
discourage intimate association with the other sex except under proper
auspices.  Pray do not mistake me.  I should like Jane-Anne to have
plenty of young male society but not to saunter about the roads
_tête-à-tête_ with any one youth during term time.  If you can see your
way to oblige me in this I shall be grateful.

"Very faithfully yours,
  "DOROTHY WILLOWS."


Mr. Wycherly read the note twice very carefully, folded it, put it back
in the envelope and, without waiting to finish his port, went for his
hat.  He crossed the road.  Mr. Gordon, seated as usual at his open
window with Gantry Bill in attendance, saw him coming, turned extremely
red and went himself to open the door, without waiting for his visitor
to knock.

Jane-Anne, seated at her studies in the parlour, also saw Mr. Wycherly’s
pilgrimage across the road, and was filled with satisfaction that her
debt was to be so speedily discharged.

"Are you Mr. Gordon?" Mr. Wycherly asked as the door was opened before
he could knock.

"I am; will you come in, sir?"

Mr. Wycherly accepted the invitation and came in.  The experience caused
his heart to beat a little faster.  It was so many years since he had
been in an undergraduate’s room.  The past came back with a rush.  What
a lot of water had flowed under Magdalen Bridge since those dear, far
off, happy, and, afterwards, most miserable days.

"Won’t you sit down, sir?" young Gordon said hospitably.

Mr. Wycherly sat down.  "I come," he said, "to discharge a debt," and
laid a shilling on the table beside him, "and I must thank you for
carrying home the eggs for my ward."

"It’s very good of you," the young man mumbled, looking much confused;
"it was nothing really; you see, my dog was the cause of the accident.
I was bound to replace the eggs."

"My ward begged me to pay her debt at once.  That is my reason for
invading you at such an unseasonable hour, but since you have received
me so hospitably, I wonder if you would further allow me to ask you a
question, Mr. Gordon?"

There was no light in the room save the grey gloaming of a May evening.
Across the road Mr. Wycherly could see a brilliant, luminous square
defining his own parlour window; he was too short-sighted to see the
studious figure seated at the table, but he perceived that she must be
plainly visible to those possessing normal sight.

"Certainly, sir," young Gordon said politely.

"You probably"—here Mr. Wycherly turned a kind, inquiring gaze upon his
young host—"have sisters?"  Mr. Gordon bowed.  "I have been out of the
way of these things for so long that it is possible I may make
mistakes—I shall be extremely obliged if you will tell me—quite frankly,
do you think we do wrong in allowing Miss Stavrides to walk about Oxford
by herself?"

George Gordon looked very hot indeed.  The last thing he had dreamt of
was that this dignified, white-haired old gentleman should consult him
about anything.  Honest himself, he was touched at the evident
earnestness and simplicity that craved his opinion.  Acting almost
automatically, he lit the gas and stood well in the centre of the light,
looking fairly and squarely at his guest.

"Since you do me the honour to ask me, sir, I should say that there is
not the smallest harm in allowing Miss Stavrides to walk alone anywhere.
If she were my sister, I shouldn’t be a bit afraid because, you see,
she’s not that sort——"

"Yes," said Mr. Wycherly; "please tell me why."

"It’s a little difficult," the young man continued, "without sounding a
bit of a cad—but it’s like this.  She walks along thinking her own
thoughts, and if she looks at you—she seems to look through you.  Now,
there are girls, nice girls, pretty girls—ladies—quite ladies, you
know—and yet you know they’ve seen you. Well, all I can say is, you’re
jolly well sure Miss Stavrides hasn’t—and so it’s no good."

"And yet," Mr. Wycherly said smoothly, "she seemed to be aware of your
existence."

George Gordon thrust his hands deep into his pockets, but he still
looked Mr. Wycherly straight in the eyes.

"She couldn’t help that.  My dog—somehow—upon my honour, I don’t know
how or why, seems awfully fond of her.  He knocked her down jumping on
her playfully, when she didn’t expect it—and what could I do?  But—I
think it’s only fair to tell you, I’ve been dying to know her ever since
I came to these rooms, and I hope I shall see her again.  She is, I
suppose you know it, sir, an extremely attractive girl, because she’s so
unusual."

Mr. Wycherly rose and held out his hand:

"I am greatly obliged to you," he said. "You have been very frank and
helpful.  It will give me great pleasure if you will come and see us—and
as a personal favour, I would ask you not to walk in the streets with
her again, for her sake."

"I should like awfully to come, sir.  It’s very kind of you.  It’s my
last term, so you won’t be troubled with me for long."

Gantry Bill rose slowly and majestically from his place in the window,
dropped to the floor, and came and sniffed at Mr. Wycherly.  George
Gordon pulled himself together with a mighty effort, and said somewhat
huskily: "You know, sir, I think she ought to have a blind or something.
Anyone can see her."

Mr. Wycherly stooped to pat Gantry Bill.

"I am still very much in your debt," he said.

                     *      *      *      *      *

That summer Montagu went in the vacation with a reading party to
Brittany.  Mr. Wycherly took Edmund and Jane-Anne to Burnhead, in
Midlothian, where he had spent so many years, and Mrs. Dew went to stay
with Lord Dursley’s housekeeper.

The minister lived in the house that had belonged to Miss Esperance; Mr.
Wycherly and the two young people lodged with her old servant, Robina.
While they were there Curly came to see the minister, who was his
father, and during the week he spent in Burnhead, he made Jane-Anne,
through Mr. Wycherly, the offer of a definite engagement in a company he
was going on tour with after Christmas. She would, of course, at first
only walk on. After that she would be entrusted with small parts and
then—her chance might come.  The company was good in more senses than
one. The actresses were ladies, two of them married to members of the
company, and Jane-Anne would be well looked after.

The project flung Mr. Wycherly into a perfect tempest of worry.  Had
Curly so much as hinted the possibility of such a thing to Jane-Anne
herself, he would have felt that he had just cause for grievance.  But
he knew that Curly had done nothing of the kind, and that it lay with
him, and with him only, to suppress or put before her this, to him,
detestable plan.

There could be but one outcome.  Mr. Wycherly’s sense of honour would
not allow him to conceal from Jane-Anne an opportunity he feared she
would be only too ready to grasp. And that same sense precluded his
laying the matter before her himself.  He knew that he was so biassed
that he must place the whole scheme in a most unattractive light; and
his very faculty for seeing all round a question prevented his
expressing the actively hostile views he most certainly held.
Therefore, he left Curly to lay the question before her.

This Curly did, and actuated, perhaps, by a somewhat similar spirit to
Mr. Wycherly’s, he hid from the girl nothing of the disagreeables she
was likely to encounter.  He painted the life of little more than a
super with a travelling company as the reverse of pleasant.  He spared
her no sordid detail, he exaggerated rather than minimised all she would
have to endure.

With downcast eyes and lips that trembled a little, she heard him in
silence to the end.  Then she turned her large gaze upon him, and asked:

"But shall I learn things?"

"It is the only way to learn things."

"Then, if the master will let me, I will come."

"He doesn’t like it.  He hates the idea.  It will make him very unhappy.
He will miss you dreadfully."

"Montagu will be at New College then.  He will be always in and out.  I
wouldn’t go if the master would be all alone.  But with Montagu there—it
makes all the difference——"

"I don’t know even now that he will consent."

"I think," said Jane-Anne, "that he will allow me to go, because he is
so just."

But Mr. Wycherly refused to give a definite opinion.

"We will wait till December," he said.

So Jane-Anne went back to school, and Mr. Wycherly sent for Miss Willows
and explained the situation to her.  To his surprise and dismay she
sided with Jane-Anne.  This was fine of Miss Willows, for she had set
her heart on Jane-Anne’s doing brilliantly at Lady Margaret Hall.  But
she understood the girl.  She realised her powers and her limitations,
and she was one who, in looking into the future for her girls, would
fain have them hitch their horses to the stars.  She believed that
Jane-Anne might become a fairly successful teacher, but she was certain
that she had it in her to become a great actress.  Miss Willows detested
mediocrity.

An unexpected ally for Mr. Wycherly appeared in the person of George
Gordon, who, having got a moderate degree, came back to Oxford to see
everybody before he settled in London to read for the bar.  With him he
brought Gantry Bill as an offering for Jane-Anne, who embraced the dog
fondly, exclaiming:

"I shall love him, if the master will keep him for me, but I don’t
expect I shall be here after Christmas, you know, except when I can get
away for a little holiday."

"Not here?" he exclaimed.  "Where are you going—abroad to study?"

"No, I’m probably going on the stage—at least, to study for the stage."

"The stage.  _You?_"

"Why not?"

"Because it’s unthinkable, because I hate it, because—I want you so
myself."

Jane-Anne looked very serious, but she didn’t blush or show any signs of
confusion.

"I shouldn’t make a nice wife," she remarked.

"I think you would make an adorable wife—but, of course, we couldn’t
marry just yet," he added honestly; "I’ve not got enough to make you
comfortable; but we could wait—and I’ll work like the dickens and—you’re
very young."

"For the matter of that, so are you, but it isn’t a question of youth or
age.  There’s something I’ve got to do, and I must do it. Marrying and
things like that must come after.  I fancy"—here she raised her solemn,
candid eyes—"everything will come after—always."

George Gordon looked so miserable that Gantry Bill went to him,
stretched up and licked one of the hands that hung so limp and
melancholy at his sides.

"Mr. Wycherly would have liked it," he said sadly.  "I spoke to him last
night, and he gave me leave to come to-day.  He would have allowed us to
be engaged."

Jane-Anne gave a little laugh.  "I am engaged," she said, "to Mr.
Wendover’s touring company."

"Damn Mr. Wendover!" exclaimed her angry suitor.  "I’m awfully sorry,
but you can’t think how I hate it.  Will you keep Bill? Mr. Wycherly
said he might stay here.  I can’t have him in London, he’d be so
miserable."

"We shall love Bill," she said gently.


Towards Christmas a bazaar was held in which Mrs. Methuen was much
interested, and among the side-shows was a little duologue which she and
Jane-Anne played together. It happened that Curly’s company was in
Oxford at the time, and one afternoon he dragged Mr. Wycherly to the
bazaar to see Jane-Anne act.

Now, although Mr. Wycherly had seen her dance hundreds of times, he had
never seen her act.  He could not screw his courage to the point of
facing the crowd of parents assembled at the school theatricals, and
Mrs. Methuen had never yet induced him to come and see the little plays
she was so fond of getting up in aid of various charities.

This time, however, wearied by Curly’s importunities and fortified by
his company, he was persuaded, and found himself seated in front of a
red curtain, in the second row of chairs, while, pince-nez on nose, he
studied a programme which bore the legend "A Joint Household."

Jane-Anne had gone to lunch with Mrs. Methuen so as to be ready for the
play which came fairly early in the afternoon.

The noisy piano ceased, the curtain was rung up, and the two ladies,
who, with their husbands, had agreed to share a house for the summer
holidays, one after the other appeared upon the scene.

Mrs. Methuen was unmistakable; pretty, eager, much concerned for the
future comfort of her absent lord.

But the other——

Mr. Wycherly was both disappointed and bewildered.

Something must have happened to Jane-Anne. Could she be ill?  This tall,
angular person in spectacles, with what he secretly stigmatized as a
"bombazine manner," must be some elderly lady imported at the last
moment to play the part.  That she played it uncommonly well did not
concern Mr. Wycherly; he was anxious about Jane-Anne.

What could have happened to the child?

The play was quite amusing.  The lady with the bombazine manner raised a
laugh whenever she opened her lips, but Mr. Wycherly couldn’t feel
interested.  He was worried.

It must be some sudden and prostrating headache that had prevented her
appearance. Yet when did he ever remember Jane-Anne to have a headache
when theatricals were to the fore?

The little play soon came to an end amidst enthusiastic applause.  Mr.
Wycherly thought it rather unfeeling of Curly to clap so vigorously.  He
didn’t seem a bit anxious about Jane-Anne.

The plaudits were so prolonged that the curtain was raised again and the
two ladies took their call.  She of the spectacles and wispy grey hair
dragged into a tight knob at the back, bowed stiffly and ungraciously as
befitted her character, but just as she reached the wings she snatched
off her spectacles with one hand and with the other deliberately blew a
kiss to Mr. Wycherly.

There was no mistaking it.  The kiss was for him and for no one else,
and the eyes hitherto discreetly hidden behind the spectacles were
exceeding dark and young and merry.

Then it was that Mr. Wycherly realised that she had not failed at the
last moment, this extraordinary Jane-Anne of his.  She was the lady of
the bombazine manner.

When they reached the street he murmured to Curly in almost awe-struck
tones, "And I never recognised her at all till the curtain went up the
second time."

"So I saw," said Curly.

"She looked so old, so severe, so hard somehow and unlovely."

"For the time being, she was Mrs. Tallet, you see," Curly explained.

"It wasn’t her appearance only, her whole atmosphere seemed so grasping
and grim."

"That," Curly remarked sententiously, "is acting."

                     *      *      *      *      *

It was gala day at the dancing-class, and Mr. Wycherly sat on the raised
daïs reserved for parents and onlookers.  He had come to watch Jane-Anne
as a pupil for the last time.

There were many "fancy dances" performed by fresh-faced girls who
manipulated their accordion-pleated skirts with a certain pretty pride
in their achievement—all but Jane-Anne.

She, slender and dark, with little oval face and shadowy heavy hair,
drawn back from her forehead, with the upward sweep of Botticelli’s
angels—she danced!

She wore a plain little frock of black chiffon, caught in round her
slender waist by a narrow black cord.

Mrs. Methuen had chosen the dress, and it was full of distinction in its
dainty severity; such a plain little dress among its rainbow-hued,
fresh-millinered companions.

And how she danced!

Floating to and fro on the waves of sound like an autumn leaf blown by
the wind.

Suddenly, by one of those flashes of telepathy that on occasion lighten
across the path of all of us, Mr. Wycherly became acutely conscious that
his was not the only soul stirred by this perfect dancing.  And the
knowledge that his enthusiastic appreciation was shared stirred in him
no feeling save that of uncomfortable foreboding.

He put on his eye-glasses and looked across the room.  There, near the
door, he saw Curly accompanied by a small, fair man in a fur coat, a
clean-shaven man whose full blue eyes expressed both interest and
pleasure, pleasure keen as his own had been.  And there was subtly
communicated to Mr. Wycherly a sense of impending change, and a
sensation of excited interrogation, so strong that he found himself
mentally demanding: "What will he do?"

And the ecstasy with which he had at first watched Jane-Anne was
interrupted and invaded by a host of alien doubts and speculations.

For he knew that the fates were busy weaving, and that the central
figure in their fabric was that of the slender girl in black who danced.

And nothing happened.

Curly and the man in the fur coat went away in a few minutes, and
neither of them had attempted to speak to Jane-Anne when her dance
ended.

But, all the same, the end was the end Mr. Wycherly had refused to face.
When it actually came to the point of granting or withholding his
permission, he bade her God speed and sent her forth.  The flame in her
shone luminous and clear; there was no questioning it; and it seemed to
him the better part to feed the fire that burned so steadily on the
altar of her high endeavour.

Mrs. Dew neither approved nor opposed. For some years now she had felt
Jane-Anne was growing beyond her; always incomprehensible, she was now
on a plane that her good aunt could only touch by means of the steady
affection she had always felt.  That way she could always reach
Jane-Anne.  Since her niece was not to be a respectable servant in a
good family, it seemed to Mrs. Dew that all other careers were equally
chimerical and dangerous.  The girl might try this play-acting. If it
failed—why, the master would have her back.  Mrs. Dew was sure of that,
and was therefore less anxious than might have been expected.

With a diffidence she had never shown before, she followed Jane-Anne
into her bedroom the afternoon before she left Holywell, and stood at
the end of the bed watching the tall girl on her knees beside the new
trunk she herself had given her.

"Look here, Jane-Anne," she said suddenly, and because she was very much
in earnest she lapsed into the broad Gloucestershire of her youth.  "I’m
not one as can talk religious—a good sharp scoldin’s more in my line—but
I’d be glad that you should remember as you come of a most respectable
family.  There’s bin Burfords in Great Stanley for two ’undred year, and
so far as we do know, never a light woman amongst ’em."

"Two hundred years," Jane-Anne echoed. "Why, then I must have ancestors,
after all."

"You can call ’em ancestors, if you do please," Mrs. Dew continued; "we
do call ’em forbears where I comes from.  Well, as I was sayin’, I’d
have you remember, an’ if you feels carried away and giddy-like, just
think as there’s a hold aunt down in Oxford as sets great store by
you——"

Mrs. Dew’s voice broke; Jane-Anne rose hastily from her knees and ran to
her aunt, and took her in her arms.

"Aunt, dear," she said, "I will remember."

"I never ’eard," Mrs. Dew went on in a muffled tone, "anything to speak
of about your father’s people.  For all I know, he might ’ave come from
some of them ’eathen gods and goddesses, bad lots they were, and it’s
that as makes we so worrited.  Burford blood you can depend on—but I’m
sure as it’s the Grecian comin’ out as drives you to play-acting."

Very gently Jane-Anne withdrew her arms from about her aunt.

"I know I’m often silly," she said humbly, "but you mustn’t blame my
father for that."

"You’re as the Lard made you," Mrs. Dew remarked drily, "and you can but
try and make the best of a bad job.  But remember this—if you feels ill,
or if you wants me any time for any reason, a telegram’ll bring me just
every bit as quick as I can put foot to the ground and find somebody to
do for the master while I be away.  You bear that in mind."

"You’re very good to me, aunt," said Jane-Anne, and flung her arms round
Mrs. Dew’s neck once more.

She and Mr. Wycherly went to evensong in the cathedral.  It was the
fourth of January, and the "proper psalms" were the twenty-second and
the twenty-third.  Jane-Anne shivered with a chilly sense of foreboding
as the wailing chant rang out, echoing eerily in the great arched roof.

"_I am poured out like water, and all my bones are out of joint: my
heart also in the midst of my body is even like melting wax._"

Presently the minor changed to something infinitely serene and sweet and
comforting; and to Jane-Anne standing timidly on the threshold of her
new life, there was promise of help that could not fail her in the
assurance:

"_The Lord is my shepherd therefore can I lack nothing._"  And at the
final verse: "_But Thy loving kindness and mercy shall follow me all the
days of my life..._" she thrust her little hand into that of her old
friend, and his closed over it with a firm and understanding clasp.

When the day, so charged with various emotions, came to an end, and she
went to bid him good-night, she found him standing on the hearth-rug in
the firelight.  Montagu had gone for a few days to a school-friend
before he came up to New, and they were all alone.

Mr. Wycherly’s lamp was turned out, but the room was full of warm, rosy
light, and Jane-Anne remembered how she had looked in and longed
wistfully to share in his kind glance, all those long years ago.  They
had had many talks together, those two, over the coming change, and each
knew the other’s hopes and fears. The old must realise that farewells
are their portion.  Only a month or two before Mr. Wycherly had seen
Edmund set out on his first voyage, and now this other child was sailing
forth on the great sea of life, leaving him behind to dream and pray
that fortune and fair winds might enwheel them both.

She came and stood beside him, laying light, gentle hands upon his
shoulders, looking at him the while with the kind, faithful eyes he
loved so well.

"Dear," she said, "do you know at all how I feel?"

"My child," he answered, "you feel, I know, everything that is best and
most beautiful, but there is just one thing that I would like you to
write upon the tablets of your heart, and that is, the remembrance that
here, in Oxford, there is an old man who would give his life’s blood to
serve you; to whom all that concerns you is absolutely vital.  Will you
remember always that, whether you are glad or sorry, successful or
unfortunate, most of all if ever—which God forbid—you should be
unfortunate—your home is here."

"I will remember," said Jane-Anne, and kissed him.

No one went with her next day to London. She preferred to go alone.
Curly was to meet her, and she was to start that night with the rest of
the company for the town in the north where their first engagement was.

Gantry Bill wandered disconsolately about the house in Holywell all that
day.  He could settle nowhere.  His beautiful tranquillity was quite
broken up.  He pattered to and fro, and whined faintly at intervals.
Mrs. Dew tempted him in vain with the choicest morsels in his special
bowl.

At last, after dinner, he sought Mr. Wycherly in his study, scratching
vigorously at the door until he was admitted.  Once in, he walked about
sniffing dubiously; finally, going to Mr. Wycherly, and with his paws
across his knees, leant heavily upon him, and looked up in his face,
plainly asking, "Where is she?"

This was Gantry Bill’s favourite attitude with Jane-Anne.  He was too
big and heavy for her to nurse, but he loved to stand on his hind legs
and lean his body across her knees, while she, generally immersed in a
book, absently stroked his head.

"She’s gone, Gantry Bill," Mr. Wycherly said, in answer to his look.
"She has gone away and left us, and we must just make the best of it."

Gantry Bill gave a sudden lurch and arranged his whole heavy person
across Mr. Wycherly’s knees.  He weighed forty-four pounds, but somehow
Mr. Wycherly had not the heart to drive him away.

Instead, he stroked him absently, and murmured:

    "Say I’m weary, say I’m sad;
    Say that health and wealth have missed me;
    Say I’m growing old, but add—
    Jenny kissed me."

electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™


Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s goals
and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will remain freely
available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure and
permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future generations. To learn
more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and how
your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4 and the
Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org .

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation


Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without wide spread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the
number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely
distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest array of
equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations ($1 to
$5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with
the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations where
we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any
statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside
the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other ways
including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To donate,
please visit: http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic
works.


Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg™
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone. For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook’s eBook
number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected _editions_ of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number. The replaced older file is renamed.
_Versions_ based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

    http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg™, including
how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to subscribe to
our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
