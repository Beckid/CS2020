Problem 1
===============================
a) No. Joe is using Depth-first search (DFS) method. Although DFS can check whether there is
a path from the source to the destination, it cannot guarantee the  path is the shortest. In
other words, this will be only right when there is no path or there is only 1 possible path.
Instead, he should adopt BFS to search level-by-level, which will yield the shortest one.
In addition, Joe's method also did not implement the numReachable method. 
b) See MazeSolver.java for the codes.
c) See MazeSolverWithPower.java for the codes.
d) See MazeGenerator.java for the codes and MazeGeneratorTestResult for the samples.
